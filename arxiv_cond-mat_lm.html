            <h2>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Legramandi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thijs G.I. van Wijk, E. Aylin Melan, Rani Mary Joy, Emerick Y. Guillaume, Paulius Pobedinskas, Ken Haenen, Danny E. P. Vanpoucke</p>
            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, C. Witteveen, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, M. Bartkowiak, H. Luetkens, R. Khasanov, F.O. von Rohr, Z. Guguchia</p>
            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <h2>Orbital-Selective Diffuse Magnetic Fluctuations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: a Unified Theoretical Picture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Alexander N. Rudenko, Yvan Sidis, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p>Compounds based on Cr have been found to be among the first single-layer magnets. In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit. We use ab initio calculations to provide a description of the various Cr$_x$Se$_{x+1}$ stoichiometries that may occur by analyzing from the bulk materials to the monolayer limit. We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.</p>

            <h2>Phase diagram of the XXZ pyrochlore model from pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shraddha Singh, Gil Refael, Aashish Clerk, Emma Rosenfeld</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Cavity Method for Hypergraphs and its Application to Quenches in the k-XOR-SAT Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aude Maier, Freya Behrens, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <h2>Taming Landau level mixing in fractional quantum Hall states with deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubing Qian, Tongzhou Zhao, Jianxiao Zhang, Tao Xiang, Xiang Li, Ji Chen</p>
            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Sticking coefficient for atoms impinging on a metallic surfaces, and the x-ray photoemission by metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Diniz</p>
            <p>Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozières-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Semiconducting ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon for high-efficiency spin-Seebeck diodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Ghasemzadeh, M. Farokhnezhad, M. Esmaeilzadeh</p>
            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of interlayer magnetic coupling across the interface in antiferromagnetic bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Halder, Sudip Mandal, Kalpataru Pradhan</p>
            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <h2>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Lorez, Mohit Pundir</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</p>

            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions.

We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite.

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

            <p>The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p>

            <h2>Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Lobo, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose</p>
            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Effective Energy, Interactions And Out Of Equilibrium Nature Of Scalar Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonin Brossollet, Etienne Lempereur, Stéphane Mallat, Giulio Biroli</p>
            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction.

While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing dynamic range through quantum deamplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu</p>
            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping.

Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Programmable Kondo Effect Formed by Landau Levels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Chen, Yun Chen, Rui Wang, Baigeng Wang</p>
            <p>Nanobubbles wield significant influence over the electronic properties of 2D materials, showing diverse applications ranging from flexible devices to strain sensors. Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <h2>Thermal decay of two-spinon bound states in quasi-2D triangular antiferromagnets</h2>

            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujia Wang, Bruno Ventéjou, Hugues Chaté, Xia-qing Shi</p>
            <p>We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</p>
            <p>We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <h2>The joint distribution of first return times and of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1D random walk before returning to the origin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mordechai Gruda, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Reimer Kühn</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <h2>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <h2>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Legramandi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</h2>

            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, C. Witteveen, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, M. Bartkowiak, H. Luetkens, R. Khasanov, F.O. von Rohr, Z. Guguchia</p>
            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <h2>Orbital-Selective Diffuse Magnetic Fluctuations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: a Unified Theoretical Picture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Alexander N. Rudenko, Yvan Sidis, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit.

We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.</p>

            <h2>Phase diagram of the XXZ pyrochlore model from pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shraddha Singh, Gil Refael, Aashish Clerk, Emma Rosenfeld</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aude Maier, Freya Behrens, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <h2>Taming Landau level mixing in fractional quantum Hall states with deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubing Qian, Tongzhou Zhao, Jianxiao Zhang, Tao Xiang, Xiang Li, Ji Chen</p>
            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Sticking coefficient for atoms impinging on a metallic surfaces, and the x-ray photoemission by metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Diniz</p>
            <p>Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozières-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Ghasemzadeh, M. Farokhnezhad, M. Esmaeilzadeh</p>
            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of interlayer magnetic coupling across the interface in antiferromagnetic bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Halder, Sudip Mandal, Kalpataru Pradhan</p>
            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

            <h2>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</h2>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <h2>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Lorez, Mohit Pundir</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shisheng Lin, Shaoqi Huang, Minhui Yang, Xin Chen, Hongjia Bi, Kangchen Xiong</p>
            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Trenins, Mariana Rossi</p>
            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

            <p>An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite.

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

            <p>The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Canon Sun, Joseph Maciejko</p>
            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory.

            <h2>Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Lobo, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose</p>
            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Effective Energy, Interactions And Out Of Equilibrium Nature Of Scalar Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonin Brossollet, Etienne Lempereur, Stéphane Mallat, Giulio Biroli</p>
            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha</p>
            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei</p>
            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction.

            <p>Building on our recent study [this https URL, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing dynamic range through quantum deamplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu</p>
            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <h2>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</h2>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Turbulent dissipative coupling in nanoscale multimode superfluid acoustics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> King L. Ng, Luís H. Carnevale, Michał Klamka, Piotr Deuar, Tomasz Bobinski, Panagiotis E. Theodorakis</p>
            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropy-driven topological quantum phase transition in magnetic impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</h2>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <h2>Thermal decay of two-spinon bound states in quasi-2D triangular antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. L. Pomponio, E. A. Ghioldi, C. J. Gazza, L. O. Manuel, A. E. Trumper</p>
            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujia Wang, Bruno Ventéjou, Hugues Chaté, Xia-qing Shi</p>
            <p>We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</p>
            <p>We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Cheng, Pablo de Vera, Rafael Garcia-Molina</p>
            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <h2>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>In this work, we have implemented an accurate machine-learning approach for predicting various key analog and RF parameters of Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistors (NCFETs). Visual TCAD simulator and the Python high-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However, the computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning approach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different sources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an artificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output relationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across various temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses ($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$, the switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower compared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the switching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore, at substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\%$ from $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio increases by $41\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that $T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal settings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These findings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and integrated circuit (IC) design.</p>

            <h2>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Legramandi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</h2>

            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>

            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations.

One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

            <h2>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</h2>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shisheng Lin, Shaoqi Huang, Minhui Yang, Xin Chen, Hongjia Bi, Kangchen Xiong</p>
            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

Second by computing directly the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits. We end by discussing the advantages of splitting a CRN into smaller chemical modules.</p>

            <p>An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials, and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.</p>

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

            <p>The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <h2>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha</p>
            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei</p>
            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</p>

            <p>Building on our recent study [this https URL, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <h2>Oscillations of a Water Droplet onto a Horizontally Vibrating Substrate</h2>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropy-driven topological quantum phase transition in magnetic impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</h2>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Poincloux, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi</p>
            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <h2>A continuum geometric approach for inverse design of origami structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alon Sardas, Michael Moshe, Cy Maor</p>
            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

            <p>We reassess the structure of the effective action and quantum critical singularities of two-dimensional Fermi systems characterized by the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}= \vec{0}$. By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions.

This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures.

Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered, harmonic solid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Szamel</p>
            <p>We present a self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered solid. The solid is modeled as a collection of randomly distributed particles connected by harmonic springs with strengths that depend on the interparticle distances, i.e the Euclidean random matrix model of Mezard et al. [Nucl. Phys. 559B, 689 (1999)]. The derivation of the theory combines two exact projection operator steps and a factorization approximation. Within our approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming transition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <h2>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</h2>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <h2>Electronic Structure and Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity of Heavily-Doped Single-Layer Graphene</h2>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <h2>When does a Fermi puddle become a Fermi sea? Emergence of pairing in two-dimensional trapped mesoscopic Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in a $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Cheng, Pablo de Vera, Rafael Garcia-Molina</p>
            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

We observed a steep reduction in THz transmission with a picosecond scale due to the X-ray-induced carrier generation, followed by a recovery on a nano to microsecond scale caused by the recombination of carriers. The rapid response in the former process is applicable to a direct determination of temporal overlap between THz and X-ray pulses for THz pump-X-ray probe experiments with an accuracy of a few picoseconds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

            <p>ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <h2>Multiple Pareto-optimal solutions of the dissipation-adaptation trade-off</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

We perform Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference measurements, demonstrate the gate-voltage dependence of the qubit frequency, and measure the qubit anharmonicity. We find relaxation times T$_{1}$ up to 119 ns, and Ramsey coherence times T$^{*}_{2}$ up to 70 ns, and a qubit frequency gate-tunable over 3.5 GHz.

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mordechai Gruda, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Reimer Kühn</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

            <p>Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</p>

            <h2>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Paviglianiti, Xhek Turkeshi, Marco Schirò, Alessandro Silva</p>
            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <h2>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asheesh S. Momi, Michael C. Abbott, Julian Rubinfien, Benjamin B. Machta, Isabella R. Graf</p>
            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <h2>Counterfactual rewards promote collective transport using individually controlled swarm microrobots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veit-Lorenz Heuthe, Emanuele Panizon, Hongri Gu, Clemens Bechinger</p>
            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingqing Cheng</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. R. Passos, Thiago R. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <h2>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atsuhisa Ota</p>
            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>Elucidating the factors limiting quantum coherence in real materials is essential to the development of quantum technologies. Here we report a strategic approach to determine the effect of lattice dynamics on spin coherence lifetimes using oxygen deficient double perovskites as host materials. In addition to obtaining millisecond $T_1$ spin-lattice lifetimes at T ~ 10 K, measurable quantum superpositions were observed up to room temperature. We determine that $T_2$ enhancement in $Sr_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ over previously studied $Ba_2CaWO_{6-\delta}$ is caused by a dynamically-driven increase in effective site symmetry around the dominant paramagnetic site, assigned as $W^{5+}$ via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, a combination of experimental and computational techniques enabled quantification of the relative strength of spin-phonon coupling of each phonon mode. This analysis demonstrates the effect of thermodynamics and site symmetry on the spin lifetimes of $W^{5+}$ paramagnetic defects, an important step in the process of reducing decoherence to produce longer-lived qubits.</p>

            <p>Titanium diselenide (TiSe$_{2}$) is a transition-metal dichalcogenide material that undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at $T_{c}\approx 200\,\mathrm{K}$. In a recent experiment [I. Tyulnev et al., arXiv:2409.04216], the high harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of this material has been studied, which exhibits asymmetric behavior with respect to the polarization angle of the incident light and provides a new perspective to the CDW phase transition. In this work, we work out a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed behavior of HHG spectra. We propose a simplified phenomenological mean-field model for this material, based on which the HHG spectra is calculated through the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. This model correctly describes the measured intensity distribution of the third-, fifth-, and seventh-order harmonic generation as a function of polarization direction and reveals a strong asymmetry due to the anisotropic CDW order in the low temperature phase. Our work provides a basis for applying high harmonic spectroscopy to reveal a new perspective on the nature of CDW orders.</p>

            <p>Heterostructures combining two or more metal and/or semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit enhanced upconversion arising from localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). However, coupled plasmon-exciton systems are slowed by excitonic relaxation and metallic multi-plasmon systems are not broadly tunable. Here, we describe a heterostructure in which insulating alumina layers vary separation between CuS and Au nanoparticles, allowing experimental confirmation of the d^(-6) dependence typical of surface-dipole mediated interactions between Au and CuS plasmons, as demonstrated in Lumerical simulations. Transient-absorption spectroscopy shows faster plasmon relaxation in heterostructured Au/CuS (690 fs) than CuS nanoparticles (929 fs), signifying direct energy transfer. Moreover, coupling between the second-harmonic LSPRs of CuS and the fundamental LSPR in Au is evident in nonlinear absorption measurement. This defines a novel harmonic-induced plasmonic resonant energy transfer (HIPRET) dynamic linking the metallic Au plasmon and the broad semiconductor plasmon in CuS. This prototype for tunable, ultrafast plasmonic upconversion exemplifies a strategy for high-efficiency nonlinear nanodevices that have promising applications in photocatalysis, parametric down-conversion and biomedical imaging.</p>

            <p>Electronic structure calculations in the time domain provide a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. The real-time Boltzmann equation (rt-BTE), used in conjunction with accurate interactions computed from first principles, has enabled reliable predictions of coupled electron and lattice dynamics. However, the timescales and system sizes accessible with this approach are still limited, with two main challenges being the different timescales of electron and phonon interactions and the cost of computing collision integrals. As a result, only a few examples of these calculations exist, mainly for two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we leverage adaptive and multirate time integration methods to achieve a major step forward in solving the coupled rt-BTEs for electrons and phonons. Relative to conventional (non-adaptive) time-stepping, our approach achieves a 10x speedup for a given target accuracy, or greater accuracy by 3-6 orders of magnitude for the same computational cost, enabling efficient calculations in both 2D and bulk materials. This efficiency is showcased by computing the coupled electron and lattice dynamics in graphene up to $\sim$100 ps, as well as modeling ultrafast lattice dynamics and thermal diffuse scattering maps in a bulk material (silicon). These results open new opportunities for quantitative studies of nonequilibrium physics in materials.</p>

            <h2>Electromagnetic evanescent field associated with surface acoustic wave: Response of metallic thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Kawada, Kei Yamamoto, Masashi Kawaguchi, Hiroki Matsumoto, Ryusuke Hisatomi, Hiroshi Kohno, Sadamichi Maekawa, Masamitsu Hayashi</p>
            <p>Surface acoustic waves (SAWs), coherent vibrational modes localized at solid surfaces, have been employed to manipulate and detect electronic and magnetic states in condensed-matter systems via strain. SAWs are commonly excited in a piezoelectric material, often the substrate. In such systems, SAWs not only generate strain but also electric field at the surface. Conventional analysis of the electric field accompanying the SAW invokes the electrostatic approximation, which may fall short in fully capturing its essential characteristics by neglecting the effect of the magnetic field. Here we study the electric and magnetic fields associated with SAWs without introducing the electrostatic approximation. The plane wave solution takes the form of an evanescent field that decays along the surface normal with a phase velocity equal to the speed of sound. If a metallic film is placed on the piezoelectric substrate, a time- and space-varying electric field permeates into the film with a decay length along the film normal defined by the skin depth and the SAW wavelength. For films with high conductivity, the phase of the electric field varies along the film normal. The emergence of the evanescent field is a direct consequence of dropping the electrostatic approximation, providing a simple but critical physical interpretation of the SAW-induced electromagnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic Dark Excitonic Mott Insulator in the Breathing-Kagome Lattice Material Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahtab Khan, Naseem Ud Din, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands (FBs) in breathing Kagome lattices (BKLs), we present a detailed first-principles study of the optical response of single-layer (SL) Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ using the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) method, incorporating self-energy corrections and excitonic effects. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of strongly bound excitons. The key results are fourfold: (i) SL Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ exhibits a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton ground state with binding energy substantially larger than the GW-renormalized band gap, giving rise to a negative exciton energy peak at $-0.14$ eV and indicating an excitonic Mott insulator phase potentially stable at room temperature ($k_B T = 0.025$ eV); (ii) the brightest exciton peak appears at 1.2 eV, in excellent agreement with experimental optical absorption spectra. (iii) We map the low-energy Frenkel exciton system onto a Hubbard model with spin-1 particles on a triangular lattice, resulting in frustrated spin configurations due to antiferromagnetic spin-spin exchange interaction. (iv) As the spin-triplet Frenkel excitons have electric dipoles that interact with each other via electric dipole-dipole interaction, we obtain antiferroelectric ordering, possibly stable at room temperature. Thus, we propose that Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ is a multiferroic dark spin-triplet excitonic Mott insulator.</p>

            <p>All-electrical baseband control of qubits facilitates scaling up quantum processors by removing issues of crosstalk and heat generation. In semiconductor quantum dots, this is enabled by multi-spin qubit encodings, such as the exchange-only qubit, where high-fidelity readout and both single- and two-qubit operations have been demonstrated. However, their performance is limited by unavoidable leakage states that are energetically close to the computational subspace. In this work, we introduce an alternative, scalable spin qubit architecture that leverages strong spin-orbit interactions of hole nanostructures for baseband qubit operations while completely eliminating leakage channels and reducing the overall gate overhead. This encoding is intrinsically robust to local variability in hole spin properties and operates with two degenerate states, removing the need for precise calibration and mitigating heat generation from fast signal sources. Finally, our architecture is fully compatible with current technology, utilizing the same initialization, readout, and multi-qubit protocols of state-of-the-art spin-1/2 systems. By addressing critical scalability challenges, our design offers a robust and scalable pathway for semiconductor spin qubit technologies.</p>

            <p>Controlling electron dynamics at optical clock rates is a fundamental challenge in lightwave-driven nanoelectronics. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast charge-state manipulation of individual selenium vacancies in monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using picosecond terahertz (THz) source pulses, focused onto the picocavity of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using THz pump--THz probe time-domain sampling of the defect charge population, we capture atomic-scale snapshots of the transient Coulomb blockade, a signature of charge transport via quantized defect states. We identify back tunneling of localized charges to the tip electrode as a key challenge for lightwave-driven STM when probing electronic states with charge-state lifetimes exceeding the pulse duration. However, we show that back tunneling can be mitigated by the Franck-Condon blockade, which limits accessible vibronic transitions and promotes unidirectional charge transport. Our rate equation model accurately reproduces the time-dependent tunneling process across the different coupling regimes. This work builds on recent progress in imaging coherent lattice and quasiparticle dynamics with lightwave-driven STM and opens new avenues for exploring ultrafast charge dynamics in low-dimensional materials, advancing the development of lightwave-driven nanoscale electronics.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima</p>
            <p>We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</p>

            <p>We develop a mesoscale transport theory for the charge and spin degrees of freedom of itinerant carriers in a $d$-wave altermagnet. Our effective Lagrangian description is built upon the slave-boson formulation of the microscopic $t-J$ model. We obtain a spin-polarized diffusive contribution to the effective Hamiltonian, with no counterpart in conventional antiferromagnetism and parametrized by the spin splitting, that is responsible for the so-called spin-splitter effect in $d$-wave altermagnets. We also elucidate the spin-transfer response of the itinerant fluid as well as the spin pumping into the altermagnet, which show previously unidentified combinations of the charge current and spatial partial derivatives (namely, {$j_{x}^{e}$,$\partial_{y}$} and {$j_{y}^{e}$,$\partial_{x}$}). The emergent spin-transfer physics in $d$-wave altermagnets opens up new possibilities for the dynamics of spin textures, such as the domain-wall motion driven by transverse charge currents. We also consider the effect of elastic distortions in the aforementioned transport properties.</p>

            <h2>Coulomb Drag in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Jie Lin, Song-Bo Zhang, Hai-Zhou Lu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>Altermagnet is a newly discovered antiferromagnet, characterized by unique anisotropic spin-split energy bands. It has attracted tremendous interest, because of its promising potential in information storage and processing. However, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from altermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag to probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active layer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated passive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb drag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in the passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit coupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More importantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence, which can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for altermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent magnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessia Gentili, Rainer Klages, Giorgio Volpe</p>
            <p>From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with Lévy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$.</p>

            <p>An anisotropic flat band fermion system with a novel dispersion that is linear along one direction and cubic along another is proposed in Phys. Rev. X. 13, 021012 (2023). We study the effects of Coulomb interaction in this fermion system by renormalization group theory and Dyson-Schwinger gap equation. We perform renormalizaton group analysis and find that fermion velocity is always restored along the direction that the fermions take cubic dispersion originally. Accordingly, the system takes the similar behaviors to the two-dimensional Dirac fermion system with Coulomb interaction in the low energy regime. Based on Dyson-Schwinger gap equation method, we find that an excitonic gap is generated if the Coulomb strength is large enough, and the system becomes a novel excitonic Chern insulator with quantized anomalous Hall conductivity. Observable quantities of this system in free case, under weak and strong enough Coulomb interaction are all analyzed.</p>

            <p>Gallium oxide is a novel advanced material gaining increasing attention for its unique combination of functional properties. It forms in several phases or polymorphs - {\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, and {\kappa} - having variable properties because of different lattice symmetries. Optical properties are of particular importance as they determine specific device applications and can also be used for phase identification. However, a direct comparison of optical polymorph signatures, including such critical parameters as bandgaps, is challenging due to the scattered, limited, or even absent data for certain phases in the literature. To address this issue, in the present work we systematically cross-correlate optical emission and absorption features of {\alpha}, {\beta}, {\gamma}, and {\kappa} thin films, as well as differently oriented {\beta}-phase bulk crystals and {\gamma}/{\beta} double polymorph structures. We demonstrate that the optical bandgap and emission features scale consistently across these polymorphs upon minimization of the methodological uncertainties. As a result, this work provides a comparative library of near- and far-field optical signatures of the polymorphs for use by the multidisciplinary research community working with gallium oxide.</p>

            <p>One of the challenges in diagrammatic simulations of nonequilibrium phenomena in lattice models is the large memory demand for storing momentum-dependent two-time correlation functions. This problem can be overcome with the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) representation of multivariable functions.

The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour employs only QTT-compressed functions, and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form, or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin textures with rich physics and great potential for unconventional computing. Typically, skyrmions form in bulk crystals with reduced symmetry or ultrathin film multilayers involving heavy metals. Here, we demonstrate the formation of fractional Bloch skyrmion tubes at room temperature by 3D printing ferromagnetic double-helix nanowires with two regions of opposite chirality. Using X-ray microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the coexistence of vortex and anti-parallel spin states induces the formation of fractional skyrmion tubes at zero magnetic fields, minimising the energy cost of breaking the coupling between geometric and magnetic chirality. We also demonstrate control over zero-field states, including pure vortex, or mixed skyrmion-vortex states, highlighting the magnetic reconfigurability of these 3D nanowires.

            <p>Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.</p>

            <p>We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the Néel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the Néel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the Néel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties.

            <p>Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.</p>

A series of molecular dynamics simulations have been combined with a classical perturbative procedure able to compute the free energy of insertion of a helium atom inside a liquid metal bath, directly related to the solubility of helium. As the most important case, the concentration of the eutectic solution has been explored in full detail. We have found that solubility of helium in pure lithium is lower than in pure lead, predicting a value at the eutectic state (16% Li-84% Pb at 508 K) of about $5 \times 10^{-16}$ Pa$^{-1}$.

Despite the model being homogeneous -- all gates are the same -- symmetry generators are not. Rather, they exhibit an even-odd staggering and a nonzero quasi-momentum, and depend on gate parameters. Such parameter-dependent symmetries can be identified by the Ruelle-Pollicott spectrum of a momentum-resolved truncated propagator. They can be thought of as a generalization of the standard SU(2) symmetry of the XXZ model that uppon introducing the staggered field splits into a local SU(2) symmetry and a non-local ${\rm U}_q({\rm sl}_2)$. Picking an arbitrary U(1) gate and varying the gate duration one will transition through different phases: fractal ballistic transport, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang superdiffusion at the critical manifold including superdiffusive helix states, and diffusion within which there is also localization. To correctly explain transport the non-local SU(2) symmetries do not matter, while the inhomogeneous local ones that almost commute with the propagator do.</p>

However, even with reinforcement from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), their mechanical properties including stiffness lag behind those of petroleum-based plastics. To identify pathways for improving CNC-reinforced SPI composites, we studied stiffening mechanisms by interpreting experimental data using homogenization models that accounted for CNC agglomeration and the formation of CNC/SPI interphases. To model effects of surface modification of CNCs with polydopamine (polyDOPA), we incorporated two key mechanisms: enhanced CNC dispersion and modified CNC-SPI interfacial interactions. Models accounted for interphases surrounding CNCs, arising from physicochemical interactions with the polyDOPA-modified CNC surfaces. Consistent wih experimental observations of polyDOPA modification enhancing mechanical properties through both increased spatial distribution of CNCs and matrix-filler interactions, results demonstrated that improved dispersion and interfacial bonding contribute to increased composite stiffness. Results highlight the potential of biodegradable CNC/SPI bio-nanocomposites as sustainable plastic alternatives, and suggest pathways for further enhancing their mechanical properties.</p>

Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa.

Cutting edge quantum science can be performed with atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and optically trapped. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we confine indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</p>

            <h2>Spatial Optical Simulator for Classical Statistical Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song-Tao Yu, Ming-Gen He, Sheng Fang, Youjin Deng, Zhen-Sheng Yuan</p>
            <p>Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.</p>

            <h2>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Habib Ammari, Jinghao Cao, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Liora Rueff</p>
            <p>This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of integro-differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</p>

            <h2>Projective purification of correlated reduced density matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Pescoller, Marie Eder, Iva Březinová</p>
            <p>In the search for accurate approximate solutions of the many-body Schrödinger equation, reduced density matrices play an important role, as they allow to formulate approximate methods with polynomial scaling in the number of particles. However, these methods frequently encounter the issue of $N$-representability, whereby in self-consistent applications of the methods, the reduced density matrices become unphysical. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the past to restore a given set of $N$-representability conditions once the reduced density matrices become defective. However, these purification algorithms have either ignored symmetries of the Hamiltonian related to conserved quantities, or have not incorporated them in an efficient way, thereby modifying the reduced density matrix to a greater extent than is necessary. In this paper, we present an algorithm capable of efficiently performing all of the following tasks in the least invasive manner: restoring a given set of $N$-representability conditions, maintaining contraction consistency between successive orders of reduced density matrices, and preserving all conserved quantities. We demonstrate the superiority of the present purification algorithm over previous ones in the context of the time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix method applied to the quench dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>A Generic Method for Integrating Lindblad Master Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. While mathematically equivalent to the widely-used vectorization method, our method offers significant improvements in the numerical efficiency, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Corentin Bertrand, Pauline Besserve, Michel Ferrero, Thomas Ayral</p>
            <p>Noise is often regarded as a limitation of quantum computers. In this work, we show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to strongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite system coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large number of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that harvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend of noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this approach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach longer time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This method would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.</p>

            <p>We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</p>

            <p>Transforming CO2 into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt3, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Rispler, Davide Vodola, Markus Müller, Seyong Kim</p>
            <p>We map the decoding problem of the surface code under depolarizing and syndrome noise to a disordered spin model, which we call the random coupled-plaquette gauge model (RCPGM). By coupling X- and Z-syndrome volumes, this model allows us to optimally account for genuine Y-errors in the surface code in a setting with noisy measurements. Using Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the code's fundamental error threshold. Firstly, for the phenomenological noise setting we determine a threshold of $6\%$ under uniform depolarizing and syndrome noise. This is a substantial improvement compared to results obtained via the previously known "uncoupled" random plaquette gauge model (RPGM) in the identical setting, where marginalizing Y-errors leads to a threshold of $4.3\%$. Secondly, we tackle the circuit-level noise scenario, where we use a reduction technique to find effective asymmetric depolarizing and syndrome noise rates to feed into the RCPGM mapping. Despite this reduction technique breaking up some of the correlations contained in the intricacies of circuit-level noise, we find an improvement exceeding that for the phenomenological case. We report a threshold of up to $1.4\%$, to be compared to $0.7\%$ under the identical noise model when marginalizing the Y-errors and mapping to the anisotropic RPGM. These results enlarge the landscape of statistical mechanical mappings for quantum error correction. In particular they provide an underpinning for the broadly held belief that accounting for Y-errors is a major bottleneck in improving surface code decoders. This is highly encouraging for leading efficient practical decoder development, where heuristically accounting for Y-error correlations has seen recent developments such as belief-matching. This suggests that there is further room for improvement of the surface code for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.</p>

We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</p>

            <p>Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</p>

            <h2>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Lerose, Tommaso Parolini, Rosario Fazio, Dmitry A. Abanin, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0<\alpha<d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0<\alpha<d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</p>

            <h2>Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems</h2>

            <p>We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited circular phonon modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. While the phonon Zeeman effect enables a theoretical description of phonon-induced magnetism, it lacks efficient angular momentum transfer from the phonon to the electron sector. In this work, we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry, with the inverse Faraday effect as a limiting case. This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry angular momentum. First-principle simulations on SrTiO$_3$ demonstrate that in parts of the Brillouin zone, this splitting between orbitals carrying angular momentum can easily reach 50 meV.</p>

This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we show the model's compliance with Weber's Law of relative stimulus perception, aligning with previous analysis of collective decision problems. Our study also identifies non-equilibrium critical behavior in specific limits of the model, where the highest values of consensus are achieved. This result highlights the intriguing relationship between optimal performance, critically, and the fluctuations caused by finite size effects, often seen in biological systems. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian C. Hübl, Carl P. Goodrich</p>
            <p>Modern experimental methods enable the creation of self-assembly building blocks with tunable interactions, but optimally exploiting this tunability for the self-assembly of desired structures remains an important challenge. Many studies of this inverse problem start with the so-called fully-addressable limit, where every particle in a target structure is different. This leads to clear design principles that often result in high assembly yield, but it is not a scaleable approach -- at some point, one must grapple with "reusing" building blocks, which lowers the degree of addressability and may cause a multitude of off-target structures to form, complicating the design process. Here, we solve a key obstacle preventing robust inverse design in the "semi-addressable regime" by developing a highly efficient algorithm that enumerates all structures that can be formed from a given set of building blocks. By combining this with established partition-function-based yield calculations, we show that it is almost always possible to find economical semi-addressable designs where the entropic gain from reusing building blocks outweighs the presence of off-target structures and even increases the yield of the target. Thus, not only does our enumeration algorithm enable robust and scalable inverse design in the semi-addressable regime, our results demonstrate that it is possible to operate in this regime while maintaining the level of control often associated with full addressability.</p>

            <h2>Local Time Statistics and Permeable Barrier Crossing: from Poisson to Birth-Death Diffusion Equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toby Kay, Luca Giuggioli</p>
            <p>Barrier crossing is a widespread phenomenon across natural and engineering systems. While an abundant cross-disciplinary literature on the topic has emerged over the years, the stochastic underpinnings of the process are yet to be linked quantitatively to easily measurable observables. We bridge this gap by developing a microscopic representation of Brownian motion in the presence of permeable barriers that allows to treat barriers with constant asymmetric permeabilities. Our approach relies upon reflected Brownian motion and on the crossing events being Poisson processes subordinated by the local time of the underlying motion at the barrier. Within this paradigm we derive the exact expression for the distribution of the number of crossings, and find an experimentally measurable statistical definition of permeability. We employ Feynman-Kac theory to derive and solve a set of governing birth-death diffusion equations and extend them to the case when barrier permeability is constant and asymmetric. As an application we study a system of infinite, identical and periodically placed asymmetric barriers for which we derive analytically effective transport parameters. This periodic arrangement induces an effective drift at long times whose magnitude depends on the difference in the permeability on either side of the barrier as well as on their absolute values. As the asymmetric permeabilities act akin to localised 'ratchet' potentials that break spatial symmetry and detailed balance, the proposed arrangement of asymmetric barriers provides an example of a noise-induced drift without the need to time-modulate any external force or create temporal correlations on the motion of a diffusing particle. By placing only one asymmetric barrier in a periodic domain we also show the emergence of a non-equilibrium steady state.</p>

Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct dispersionless crystal electric field energy bands, with the fitted crystal electric field model predicting a single-ion singlet ground state and an energy gap of ~9 meV separating it from the first excited (singlet) state. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV.

            <p>The classic Johnson Kendall Roberts (JKR) theory describes the short-ranged adhesive contact of elastic bodies, but is only valid for axisymmetric contact. A theory for non-axisymmetric contact, which relies on approximating the contact region as an ellipse, was proposed by Johnson and Greenwood (JG). The theory includes the effects of adhesion via Griffith's criterion applied only at the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contact ellipse. Although JG's work is in good agreement with numerical and experimental results for quasi-circular contacts, the agreement worsens as the eccentricity of the contact region increases. In this paper, we show that including the effects of adhesion by instead minimizing the sum of elastic and surface energy yields results that are in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations over the full range of contact eccentricities.</p>

            <p>The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in exploring higher-order topology and their semi-metallic counterparts, particularly in the context of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, termed as higher-order Dirac semimetal (HODSM) and higher-order Weyl semimetal (HOWSM). The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs (FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the HOWSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both surface and hinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology and also possesses both first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we investigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple hinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one. Furthermore, we obtain a multi-HOWSM (mHOWSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying an external magnetic field. The mHOWSM phase possesses both the dipolar winding number being the representative invariant for first-order topology, and the QWN, featuring both surface and multiple hinge FAs. We study the spectral properties of the mHODSM and mHOWSM in different geometries. We also investigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in mHOWSM employing a two-terminal setup.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures: dependence on the number of superconducting monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. S. Ianovskaia, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova</p>
            <p>The magnetic proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures with a large number of atomic layers leads to a suppression of the superconducting order parameter and appearance of Zeeman-like spin splitting of the local density of states (LDOS). Here we study the magnetic proximity effects in van der Waals S/F heterostructures with a few atomic layers and demonstrate that the corresponding physics is very different from the classical results. We find that the dependence of the superconducting order parameter exhibits dips as a function of the ferromagnetic exchange field and gating. The number of dips is determined by the number of monolayers in the heterostructure and, in general, the superconductivity is not suppressed by large values of the exchange field. The spin splitting of the LDOS cannot be described by an effective Zeeman field and manifests a multiple peak structure, where each peak is connected to a unique spin splitting of one of the superconducting bands, which also can be tuned by gating.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Masłowski, Hadi Cheraghi, Jesko Sirker, Nicholas Sedlmayr</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions are non-analyticities in a dynamical free energy (or return rate) which occur at critical times. Although extensively studied in one dimension, the exact nature of the non-analyticity in two and three dimensions has not yet been fully investigated. In two dimensions, results so far are known only for relatively simple two-band models. Here we study the general two- and three-dimensional cases. We establish the relation between the non-analyticities in different dimensions, and the functional form of the densities of Fisher zeroes. We show, in particular, that entering a critical region where the density of Fisher zeroes is non-zero at the boundary always leads to a cusp in the derivative of the return rate while the return rate itself is smooth. We illustrate our results by obtaining analytical results for exemplary two- and three-dimensional models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janet Zhong, Heming Wang, Shanhui Fan</p>
            <p>There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. An alternate `pole-zero' approach uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</p>

            <p>We give a description of cell diffusion in a soft tissue, paying special attention to the coupling of force, matter, and microforce balance laws through a suitable dissipation principle. To this end, we cast our framework into a multi-level schematics, comprising both kinematics and kinetics, based on a characterization of the free energy. We lay down first a force balance law, where force and stress fields are defined as power conjugate quantities to velocity fields and their gradients, then we give a species molar balance law, with chemical potential test fields, as power conjugate quantities to the rate of change of the species concentration, and finally a microforce balance law. The main feature of this framework is the constitutive expression for the chemical potential which is split into a term derived from the homogeneous convex part of the free energy and an active external chemical potential giving rise to the spinodal decomposition. The active part of the chemical potential is given an expression depending on the cell concentration and resembling the one defined in [Oster, Murray and Harris, J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 78 (1983)], where it is meant to characterize an upward cell diffusion induced by cell motility. Further we show how an external vector field, entering the microforce balance law as a power conjugate quantity to the rate of change of the concentration gradient, can guide the diffusion process to a different limit stationary pattern. This vector field could possibly model any directional cue or bias characterizing the interaction of the migrating cells and the surrounding tissue.</p>

            <p>Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we construct a time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes, and observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges. Using a frequency-comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong-coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes, analogous to the well-known Young's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</p>

Recently, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have attracted attention as sensors capable of quantitatively measuring the amplitude and phase of coherent spin waves. However, the conventional sensing protocol has been limited to detecting spin waves whose frequencies match the resonance frequency of the NV spins. We demonstrate that by utilizing the AC Zeeman effect, it is possible to image spin waves propagating in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film over a wide frequency range up to a maximum detuning of 567 MHz without changing the external magnetic field. Our results expand the applicability of NV centers for spin-wave sensing and pave the way for quantitative investigations of the dynamics in various magnetic materials, such as metallic ferromagnets and van der Waals magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Accurate quantitative prediction of the finite-temperature properties of a phase transitioning system has been a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we regard a collective vector mode as essential quasiparticle excitation of the displacive ferroelectricity. Starting from the quantum statistic description of this excitation, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition theory of displacive ferroelectricity. This theory enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions, in a striking contrast to the widely used Landau-Ginzburg phenomenological description near the critical point. Its applications to the quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$ as well as the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured critical behaviors of the phase transitions and the corresponding dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases without fitting parameters. The theory should be general and can be utilized to understand a broad range of phase transitions in other bosonic systems.</p>

            <p>When exploring new magnetic materials, the effect of alloying plays a crucial role for numerous properties. By altering the alloy composition, it is possible to tailor, e.g., the Curie temperature ($T_\text{C}$). In this work, $T_\text{C}$ of various alloys is investigated using a previously developed technique [Brännvall et al. Phys. Rev. Mat. (2024)] designed for robust predictions of $T_\text{C}$ across diverse chemistries and structures. The technique is based on density functional theory calculations and utilizes the energy difference between the magnetic ground state and the magnetically disordered paramagnetic state. It also accounts for the magnetic entropy in the paramagnetic state and the number of nearest magnetic neighbors. The experimentally known systems, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$, Fe$_{1-x}$V$_x$, NiMnSb-based Heusler alloys, Ti$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$N, and Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ are investigated. The experimentally unexplored system Fe$_{1-x}$Tc$_x$ is also tested to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method in guiding future experimental efforts. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed method across various systems, requiring less hands-on adjustments compared to other theoretical approaches.</p>

            <p>Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modelled by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains affine but the relation is not additive.</p>

Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies.</p>

We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>Scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements, which underpins the phenomenon known as the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). However, typical decoherence noises disrupts the volume law phase, complicating the observation of MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enabling its detection in experiment. The transition is characterized by the conditional entanglement entropy (CEE), which is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as competing external random fields. When the net external field is zero, a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting in the MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an average apparatus-environment symmetry, making CEE a valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as a genuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we provide numerical results demonstrate the MIPT in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum circuit under dephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate, enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally and ensuring the feasibility of our protocol. Our result serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise.</p>

            <p>Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</p>

            <p>Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p>

Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</p>

Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</p>

            <p>Neural-network-based variational quantum states in general, and more recently autoregressive models in particular, have proven to be powerful tools to describe complex many-body wave functions. However, their performance crucially depends on the computational basis chosen and they often lack physical interpretability. To mitigate these issues, we here propose a modified variational Monte-Carlo framework which leverages prior physical information to construct a computational second-quantized basis containing a reference state that serves as a rough approximation to the true ground state. In this basis, a Transformer is used to parametrize and autoregressively sample the corrections to the reference state, giving rise to a more interpretable and computationally efficient representation of the ground state. We demonstrate this approach using a non-sparse fermionic model featuring a metal-insulator transition and employing Hartree-Fock and a strong-coupling limit to define physics-informed bases. We also show that the Transformer's hidden representation captures the natural energetic order of the different basis states. This work paves the way for more efficient and interpretable neural quantum-state representations.</p>

            <p>The research on supercurrent diodes has surged rapidly due to their potential applications in electronic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. To unlock this functionality, it is essential to find supercurrent diodes that can work consistently at zero magnetic field and under ubiquitous stray fields generated in electronic circuits. However, a supercurrent diode with robust field tolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient supercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson junction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero magnetic field. More importantly, the supercurrent rectification persists over a wide and bipolar magnetic field range beyond industrial standards for field tolerance. By theoretically modeling a multiferroic Josephson junction, we unveil that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and multiferroicity underlies the unusual field resilience of the observed diode effect. This work introduces multiferroic Josephson junctions as a new field-resilient superconducting device for cryogenic electronics.</p>

            <h2>Multiparty Entanglement Microscopy of Quantum Ising models in 1d, 2d and 3d</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuke Lyu, Menghan Song, Ting-Tung Wang, Zi Yang Meng, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Entanglement microscopy reveals the true quantum correlations among the microscopic building blocks of many-body systems arXiv:2402.14916. Using this approach, we study the multipartite entanglement of the quantum Ising model in 1d, 2d, and 3d. We first obtain the full reduced density matrix (tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the subregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as well as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME concurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a complete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the symmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3- and 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching maximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular scaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe a sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the monogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for subregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark illustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum matter arXiv:2402.06677. Finally, we analyze the most collective form of entanglement by evaluating the GME concurrence among all spins in the lattice, which can be obtained from a simple observable: the single-site transverse magnetization. This global concurrence is larger in 1d compared to 2d/3d, but it is relatively less robust against perturbations such as local measurements.</p>

            <h2>Quantum charge sensing using semiconductor device based on $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan P. Mendez, Denis Mamaluy</p>
            <p>We report a novel nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that FET-based sensors utilizing APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e. for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.</p>

            <h2>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianye Yu, Ijaz Shahid, Peitao Liu, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the Néel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the Néel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the Néel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases of antimony sulphoiodide investigated by means of ab-initio simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Cuono, Andrea Droghetti, Silvia Picozzi</p>
            <p>First-principles calculations are employed to study the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding visible light energy, limiting their photovoltaic performance. Featuring a visible-range band gap, SbSI instead combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. The calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct Rashba-Dresselhaus and Weyl-like spin textures relevant for spintronics. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting large photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it can serve to identify the phase of the material, with the circular photogalvanic effect which also reflects spin-texture changes. With its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising material candidate for efficient solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.</p>

            <p>The discovery of novel superconducting materials is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with a wealth of potential for applications in energy, transportation, and computing. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled expediting the search for new materials by efficiently utilizing vast materials databases. In this study, we developed an approach based on deep learning (DL) to predict new superconducting materials. We have synthesized a compound derived from our DL network and confirmed its superconducting properties in agreement with our prediction. Our approach is also compared to previous work based on random forests (RFs). In particular, RFs require knowledge of the chem-ical properties of the compound, while our neural net inputs depend solely on the chemical composition. With the help of hints from our network, we discover a new ternary compound $\textrm{Mo}_{20}\textrm{Re}_{6}\textrm{Si}_{4}$, which becomes superconducting below 5.4 K. We further discuss the existing limitations and challenges associated with using AI to predict and, along with potential future research directions.</p>

            <h2>Shot noise and universal Fano factor as characterization of strongly correlated metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiming Wang, Chandan Setty, Shouvik Sur, Liyang Chen, Silke Paschen, Douglas Natelson, Qimiao Si</p>
            <p>Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems. Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a correlation regime. Thus, we establish the aforementioned Fano factor as universal to Fermi liquids, and show that the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.</p>

            <h2>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</h2>

            <p>The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</p>
