            <h2>Doping lattice non-abelian quantum Hall states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Carolyn Zhang, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Upper bound on $T_c$ in a strongly coupled electron-boson superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay V. Gnezdilov, Rufus Boyack</p>
            <p>Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</p>

            <h2>XDiag: Exact Diagonalization for quantum many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Wietek, Luke Staszewski, Martin Ulaga, Paul L. Ebert, Hannes Karlsson, Siddhartha Sarkar, Henry Shackleton, Aritra Sinha, Rafael D. Soares</p>
            <p>Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schrödinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Gravitons on the Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hernan B. Xavier, Zeno Bacciconi, Titas Chanda, Dam Thanh Son, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>Chiral graviton modes are elusive excitations arising from the hidden quantum geometry of fractional quantum Hall states. It remains unclear, however, whether this picture extends to lattice models, where continuum translations are broken and additional quasiparticle decay channels arise. We present a framework in which we explicitly derive a field theory incorporating lattice chiral graviton operators within the paradigmatic bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model. Extensive numerical evidence suggests that chiral graviton modes persist away from the continuum, and are well captured by the proposed lattice operators. We identify geometric quenches as a viable experimental probe, paving the way for the exploration of chiral gravitons in near-term quantum simulation experiments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometry and dipolar dynamics in the orbital magneto-electric effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James H. Cullen, Daniel P. Arovas, Roberto Raimondi, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>We show that the orbital magneto-electric effect (OME) -- the generation of a steady-state orbital angular momentum density -- is partly the result of a nonequilibrium dipole moment generated via Zitterbewegung and proportional to the quantum metric. For tilted massive Dirac fermions this dipole gives the only contribution to the OME in the insulating case, while the intrinsic and extrinsic OMEs occur for different electric field orientations, yielding an experimental detection method. Our results suggest quantum metric engineering as a route towards maximizing orbital torques.</p>

            <h2>Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreehari Jayaram, Malik Lenger, Dong Zhao, Lucas Pupim, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Ruoming Peng, Marc Scheffler, Rainer Stöhr, Mathias S. Scheurer, Jurgen Smet, Jörg Wrachtrup</p>
            <p>The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectric Nematic and Smectic Liquid Crystals with Sub-Molecular Spatial Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parikshit Guragain, Arjun Ghimire, Manisha Badu, Netra Prasad Dhakal, Pawan Nepal, James T. Gleeson, Samuel Sprunt, Robert J. Twieg, Antal Jákli</p>
            <p>A number of highly polar three ring rod-shaped compounds with a terminal thiophene ring have been synthesized and the physical properties of a subset are reported in detail. On cooling from the isotropic fluid, they directly transition to a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) phase that shows the strongest spatial correlations corresponding to 1/3 of the molecular length (L/3). The set of thiophene compounds reported here have ferroelectric polarizations about 20% larger than that of usual ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal materials. Such large polarization values are due to the ~20% larger mass densities of these thiophene compounds compared to most of the NF materials with short terminal chains. These unusual properties are consequences of tighter molecular packing due to the lack of flexible terminal chains. Below the NF phase, compounds with a single nitro or two cyano polar groups on the terminal benzene ring exhibit a so far never observed smectic phase with periodicity ~1/3 the molecular length. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model of this phase featuring antipolar packing of the molecules within the layers.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of quantum and real-space geometry in the anomalous Landau levels of singular flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuanyu Long, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry of electronic state in momentum space, distinct from real-space structural geometry, has attracted increasing interest to shed light on understanding quantum phenomena. An interesting recent study [Nature 584, 59-63 (2020)] has numerically solved a 2-band effective Hamiltonian to show the anomalous Landau level (ALL) spreading $\mathit{\Delta}$ of a singular flat band (SFB), such as hosted in a kagome lattice, in relation to the maximal quantum distance $d$ of the SFB, $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$, which enables a direct measure of quantum geometry. Here, we investigate the ALLs of SFB by studying both the 2-band Hamiltonian and a diatomic kagome lattice hosting two SFBs mirrored by particle-hole symmetry. We derive an exact analytical solution of the 2-band Hamiltonian to show there are two branches of $\mathit{\Delta}(d)$. Strikingly, for the diatomic kagome lattice, $\mathit{\Delta}$ depends on not only $d$ but also $r$, the real-space diatomic distance. As $r$ increases, $\mathit{\Delta}$ shrinks toward zero while $d$ remains intact, which can be intuitively understood from the magnetic-field-induced disruption of destructive interference of the SFB compact localized states. Based on semiclassical theory, we derive rigorously the dependence of $\mathit{\Delta}$ on $r$ that originates from the tuning of the non-Abelian orbital moment of the two SFBs by real-space geometry.</p>

            <h2>The unidirectional Seebeck detection of the Néel vector in the two-dimensional tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Ting Xiao, Ying-Li Wu, Jia-Liang Wan, Xiao-Qin Yu</p>
            <p>The efficient detection of the reversal (180$^{\circ}$ rotation) of the Néel vector is one of the crucial tasks in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a thermal approach to detect the reversal of the Néel vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials through the unidirectional Seebeck effect (USE). Being different from the previous works in which USE stems from the global Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or asymmetric magnon scattering, we find that the USE originates from the coupling of the hidden Rashba SOC and the Néel vector in the tetragonal $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnetic materials in the absence of the global Rashba SOC. Using a generic minimal model, we analyse the behaviors of the USE for the two-dimensional tetragonal lattice $\mathcal{PT}$ antiferromagnet. Importantly, It's found that when the Néel vector is reversed, the sign of the USE changes, which can be utilized to detect the reversal of the Néel vector.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of Quantum Geometry Near the Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y R Kartik, Jhih-Shih You, H. H. Jen</p>
            <p>The geometry of quantum states can be an indicator of criticality, yet it remains less explored under non-Hermitian topological conditions. In this work, we unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state manifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian long-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain criticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function associated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits spatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum geometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding light on the emergence of novel universality classes.</p>

            <h2>Photocurrent generation from spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita</p>
            <p>Using real-time simulations, we explore the photocurrent induced by localized spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals. These materials exhibit strong spin-charge coupling because the energy scales of the electronic and spin systems are of the same order. The photocurrent response exhibits a pronounced peak reflecting the presence of the Dirac point at the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. This contribution plays a crucial role in the photocurrent generation when the electronic filling is set around the Dirac nodes in the Dirac semimetal. We also reveal that the photocurrent response exhibits a low-frequency divergence due to the modulation of the resonance frequency of the localized spin system. Our findings clarify that the photocurrent response arising from the spin dynamics reflects the band topology of the Dirac semimetals, and the localized spin dynamics plays an important role in the photocurrent generation.</p>

            <h2>Proximity Induced Non-collinear Magnetic States in Planar Superconductor/Ferromagnet Hybrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Kopasov, S. V. Mironov, A. S. Mel'nikov</p>
            <p>The proximity induced superconducting (S) correlations in ferromagnetic (F) layers of planar S/F hybrids are shown to be responsible for the appearance of a nonlinear interaction between the magnetic moments of the F layers. This interaction originates from the combined influence of the orbital and exchange phenomena and can result in the spontaneous formation of non-collinear magnetic states in these systems. The proposed nonlinear coupling mechanism and resulting changes of magnetic textures are crucial for the design of the superconducting spintronics devices exploiting the long-range spin triplet proximity effect.</p>

            <h2>Multilayer Crystal Field states from locally broken centrosymmetry</h2>

            <p>Local charge, spin, or orbital degrees of freedom with intersite interactions are oftentimes sufficient to construct most quantum orders. This is conventionally true for f-electron systems, where the extent of the f-electrons and their associated crystal-electric-field (CEF) states are strongly localized. Here, polarized Raman spectroscopy measurements of a locally non-centrosymmetric compound, CeCoSi, unveil more CEF excitations than expected in the local model. We interpret this as experimental evidence for the entanglement of CEF states between cerium layers. This composite sublattice, spin, and orbital degree of freedom provides an unconsidered means to form novel orders, not only in this system, but in any system exhibiting globally preserved yet locally broken centrosymmetry.</p>

            <p>We provide experimental evidence for the absence of a magnetic moment in bulk RuO$_2$, a candidate altermagnetic material, by using a combination of Mössbauer spectroscopy, nuclear forward scattering, inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering, and density functional theory calculations. Using complementary Mössbauer and nuclear forward scattering we determine the $^{99}$Ru magnetic hyperfine splitting to be negligible. Inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering derived lattice dynamics of RuO$_2$ are compared to density functional theory calculations of varying flavors. Comparisons among theory with experiments indicate that electronic correlations, rather than magnetic order, are key in describing the lattice dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell with efficiency of 18.2% enabled by a hole transport layer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taowen Wang, Longfei Song, Saeed Bayat, Michele Melchiorre, Nathalie Valle, Adrian-Marie Philippe, Emmanuel Defay, Sebastjan Glinsek, Susanne Siebentritt</p>
            <p>Reducing the thickness of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells is a key objective in order to reduce production cost and to improve sustainability. The major challenge for sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells is the recombination at the backside. In standard Cu(In,Ga)Se2 backside recombination is suppressed by a bandgap gradient, acting as a back surface field. This gradient is difficult to maintain in sub-micron thick absorbers. In this study, a hole transport layer passivates the back contact and enables efficient sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells without the need of a Ga gradient. The backside passivation by the hole transport layer is as effective as an optimized Ga gradient, resulting in a significant increase in open-circuit voltage by 80 mV in comparison to the reference sample without passivation. Moreover, the hole transport layer exhibits good transport properties, leading to a fill factor as high as 77%. Photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.15% and solar cell efficiency above 18% are demonstrated in sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-bound layer breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Enaldiev</p>
            <p>Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moiré superlattices. Spatial modulation of interlayer distance, caused by the dislocations, generates effective potentials that promote emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer breathing modes inside perfect dislocations forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers. We show that for parallel MX$_2$ bilayers perfect dislocations host several quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above layer breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains, whereas for antiparallel bilayers only a single quasi-bound band arises near the edge dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</p>

            <h2>Parametrically amplified Josephson plasma waves in YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x): evidence for local superconducting fluctuations up to the pseudogap temperature $T^*$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios H. Michael, Eugene Demler, Patrick Lee</p>
            <p>A number of experiments have reported evidence for the existence of the lower Josephson plasmon mode in underdoped YBCO up to the pseudogap temperature scale when the sample is subject to intense terahertz pulses. Evidences include the observation of a reflectivity edge that resembles that of the superconducting state, and the second harmonic generation of a probe optical pulse that is modulated at a frequency similar the reflectivity feature. Since the lower Josephson plasmon mode is often associated with coherent oscillations between bilayers in the YBCO structure, these experiments have led to the suggestion that the intense pump has created pair coherence up to 350K. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation of these experiments based on the model of short ranged superconducting correlations in the equilibrium state and using the Floquet perspective to analyze optical responses of the photoexcited state. Our model only requires local pairing with phase correlations that can be very short ranged when the system is at equilibrium at a temperature above Tc but below the pseudo-gap temperature T*. Within this assumption there is no phase coherence between bilayers. On the other hand the relative phase between members of the bilayer has a longer in-plane correlation which leads locally to a finite Josephson current. We show that the nonlinearity afforded by the local intra-bilayer Josephson current is sufficient to explain both the reflectivity and second harmonic generation data. The key point is that in the lower Josephson plasmon, the coupling between bilayers is mainly capacitive: the Josepson current between bilayers can be set to zero without affecting the parametric amplification process. The implication is that while superconducting coherence may not be created by the pump, the pseudogap phase must possess a local pairing amplitude at equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ylea Vlamidis, Carmela Marinelli, Aldo Moscardini, Paolo Faraci, Stefan Heun, Stefano Veronesi</p>
            <p>The controlled functionalization of graphene is critical for tuning and enhancing its properties, thereby expanding its potential applications. Covalent functionalization offers a deeper tuning of the geometric and electronic structure of graphene compared to non-covalent methods; however, the existing techniques involve side reactions and spatially uncontrolled functionalization, pushing research toward more selective and controlled methods. A promising approach is 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, successfully utilized with carbon nanotubes. In the present work, this method has been extended to graphene flakes with low defect concentration. A key innovation is the use of a custom-synthesized ylide with a protected amine group (Boc), facilitating subsequent attachment of functional molecules. Indeed, after Boc cleavage, fluorescent dyes (Atto 425, 465, and 633) were covalently linked via NHS ester derivatization. This approach represents a highly selective method of minimizing structural damage. Successful functionalization was demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy, confirming the effectiveness of the method. This novel approach offers a versatile platform, enabling its use in biological imaging, sensing, and advanced nanodevices. The method paves the way for the development of sensors and devices capable of anchoring a wide range of molecules, including quantum dots and nanoparticles. Therefore, it represents a significant advancement in graphene-based technologies.</p>

            <h2>Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonbai Kim, SeungJun Jeon, Hanwool Song</p>
            <p>A field theory of a Schrödinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Robust quantum anomalous Hall effect with spatially uncorrelated disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristof Moors, Gen Yin</p>
            <p>In magnetic topological insulators, a phase transition between quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and Anderson localization insulating phases can be triggered by the rotation of an applied magnetic field. Without the scattering paths along magnetic domains, this phase transition is governed by scattering induced by nonmagnetic disorder. We show that the QAH phase is strikingly robust in the presence of spatially uncorrelated disorder. The robustness is attributed to a resilience of the topological band gap against disorder, induced by quantum confinement. The critical behavior near the phase transition suggests that the scattering is distinct from quantum percolation. This provides new insights on the robustness of the QAH effect in magnetic topological insulators with atomic defects, impurities, and dopants.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Attractive and Repulsive Interactions: From Classical to Quantum Gases in the Generalized Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution</h2>

            <p>The thermodynamic parameter space is flat for an ideal classical gas with non-interacting particles. In contrast, for an ideal quantum Bose (Fermi) gas, the thermodynamic curvature is positive (negative), indicating intrinsic attractive (repulsive) interactions. We generalize the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by employing a generalized form of the exponential function, proposing the Mittag-Leffler Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution within the framework of superstatistics. We demonstrate that the generalization parameter, $\alpha$, quantifies the statistical interaction. When $\alpha = 1$, the distribution coincides with the standard classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, where no statistical interaction is present. For $0 < \alpha < 1$ ($\alpha > 1$), the statistical interaction is repulsive (attractive), corresponding to a negative (positive) thermodynamic curvature of the system.</p>

            <h2>Clarification of the Spontaneous Polarization Direction in Crystals with Wurtzite Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Fichtner, Mohamed Yassine, Chris van de Walle, Oliver Ambacher</p>
            <p>The wurtzite structure is one of the most frequently found crystal structures in modern semiconductors and its inherent spontaneous polarization is a defining materials property. Despite this significance, confusion has been rampant in the literature with respect to the orientation of the spontaneous polarization inside the unit cell of the wurtzite structure, especially for the technologically very relevant III-N compounds (AlN, GaN, InN). In particular, the spontaneous polarization has been reported to either point up or down for the same unit cell orientation, depending on the literature source - with important implications for, e.g., the carrier type and density expected at interfaces of heterostructures involving materials with wurtzite-structure. This perspective aims to resolve this ambiguity by reviewing available reports on the direction of the energetically preferred polarization direction in the presence of external electric fields, as well as atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images. While we use ferroelectric wurtzite AlScN as a key example, our conclusions are generalizable to other compounds with the same crystal structure. We demonstrate that a metal-polar unit cell must be associated with an upward polarization vector - which is contrary to long-standing conventional wisdom.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the ion-irradiation-induced phase transition in gallium oxide (Ga2O3) from the $\beta$ to the $\gamma$ phase, the role of defects during the transformation, and the quality of the resulting crystal structure. Using a multi-method analysis approach including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode (RBS/c), Doppler broadening variable energy positron annihilation spectroscopy (DB-VEPAS) and variable energy positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (VEPALS) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have characterized defects at all the relevant stages before, during, and after the phase transition. Reduction in backscattering yield was observed in RBS/c spectra after the transition to the $\gamma$ phase. This is corroborated by a significant decrease in the positron trapping center density due to generation of embedded vacancies intrinsic for the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 but too shallow in order to trap positrons. A comparison of the observed positron lifetime of $\gamma$-Ga2O3 with different theoretical models shows good agreement with the three-site $\gamma$ phase approach. A characteristic increase in the effective positron diffusion length and the positron lifetime at the transition point from $\beta$-Ga2O3 to $\gamma$-Ga2O3 enables visualization of the phase transition with positrons for the first time. Moreover, a subsequent reduction of these quantities with increasing irradiation fluence was observed, which we attribute to further evolution of the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 and changes in the gallium vacancy density as well as relative occupation in the crystal lattice.</p>

            <h2>Crystal structural evolution of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ under pressure and its implication on possible electronic changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. A. Irshad, P. Anees, Hrudananda Jena, Boby Joseph</p>
            <p>Ru$_3$Sn$_7$, an intermetallic compound with advanced catalytic properties, exhibits a complex crystal structure and intriguing electronic properties, making it an attractive candidate for investigations under high-pressure (HP). The structural, vibrational and electronic band structure of this compound were investigated at HP up to ~ 20 GPa using synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, micro-Raman, and density functional theory (DFT), respectively. Despite the local structural changes implied by a discernible reduction in the compressibility and distinct slope changes in the pressure evolution of the symmetric stretching vibrations of the Ru and Sn atoms around 8 GPa, the cubic structure is found to be stable throughout the pressure range. In support, our calculated phonon dispersion relation confirmed the stability of the cubic phase till the highest pressures. A comprehensive analysis of the Raman spectrum reveals the signatures of the pressure induced sudden strengthening of electron-phonon coupling as early as 3 GPa which is backed by a bounce in the phonon and electron density of states (DoS). Electronic structure calculations demonstrate that the metallic nature of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ is preserved in the studied pressure range with a minor redistribution of electronic DoS across the Fermi level (EF). The band structure calculations predict intriguing changes in the electronic structure, revealing the pressure induced dp hybridization through the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone which is largely responsible for the observed reduction in the compressibility and enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling in Ru$_3$Sn$_7$.</p>

            <p>With photoelectrochemical water splitting being one of the most promising approaches for clean energy production and storage, the search for efficient photoelectrode materials is greater than ever. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a well-established semiconductor with suitable band edge positions that has already been successfully employed in photoelectrochemical solar cells. However, to utilize it as efficiently as possible, a proper understanding of its properties when interfaced with water is required, and this is currently lacking. In this work we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the properties of the aqueous interfaces of various GaP non-polar (110) and polar (001) terminations. We calculate their band alignment with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode potential and investigate their interfacial structural properties. Based on these properties we assess the capability of the various terminations to catalyze the reactions associated with water splitting and propose approaches for improving the performance of GaP for application in PECs.</p>

            <p>Transition metal aluminum nitrides are a technologically important class of multifunctional ceramics. While the HfAlN system is to a large extent unexplored, we study phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical properties of rocksalt cubic (c-) phase and wurtzite-hexagonal (h-) phase Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films grown on MgO(001) substrates using ion-assisted reactive magnetron sputtering. Single-crystal c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ films were obtained with $x < 0.30$. Spinodal decomposition taking place during film deposition resulted in a three-dimensional checkerboard superstructure of AlN-rich and HfN-rich nanodomains, as opposed to a metastable cubic solid solution. Lattice-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray and electron diffraction reveals that the superstructure period is along all three <100> directions and scales almost linearly between 9-13 A with increasing Al content. For $x > 0.41$, however, nanocrystalline h-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ consisting of segregated Hf- and Al-rich nanodomains in a (0001) fiber texture forms. The nanoindentation hardness of these films increases sharply with x, from 26 GPa for HfNy, to 38 GPa for c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$, due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields. The hardness drops to 22 GPa for the softer h-Hf1-xAlxNy, still remaining considerably higher than that of a binary AlN. In micropillar compression testing, c-Hf$_{0.93}$Al$_{0.07}$N$_{1.15}$ exhibits a linear elastic response up until strain burst, with brittle fracture occurring at a much higher yield stress compared to HfN$_y$, on {110}<011> slip systems, which is attributed to superstructure inhibited dislocation motion. In contrast, h-Hf$_{0.59}$Al$_{0.41}$N$_{1.23}$ exhibits limited plasticity and a high yield stress followed by strain burst, attributed to the nanocrystalline structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Heggen, José Enrique Martinez Medina, Emanuele Barborini</p>
            <p>In this study, we report on the spontaneous formation of highly ordered 2D layered domains of intermetallic phase PtSn4 in Sn nanoparticles of dimensions of the order of 10 nm during the gas aggregation process occurring in Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition. Phase identification is based on High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and on X-ray emission analysis coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. We propose that PtSn4-ordered domains precipitate inside Sn nanoparticles once the temperature drops below 520°C upon collisional cooling with room temperature Argon, while the nanoparticles persist longer in a liquid state. Sn matrix eventually solidifies upon the sudden temperature drop due to the supersonic expansion. 2D-layered PtSn4 domains create interparticle heterostructures that disrupt the spherical symmetry typical of gas aggregation processes and separate the Sn particle into distinct parts. The Dirac nodal arc semimetal character of PtSn4 makes it particularly interesting for studying the transport mechanisms in nanogranular films obtained by the soft-assembling of such nanoparticles, which feature a network of heterostructures showing sequences of alternate PtSn4 2D domains and metallic \b{eta}-Sn necks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lois Smith, Jessica Steele, Hossein Ali Karimi-Varzaneh, Paola Carbone</p>
            <p>Plasticisers (PLs) are small additives commonly incorporated into polymer composites to enhance processability and improve mechanical properties. Their effectiveness depends heavily on their miscibility within the polymer melt, yet isolating the influence of plasticiser properties, such as flexibility and geometry, remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the time consuming nature of experimental work and also from the presence of impurities and inconsistencies that often arise during synthesis and testing. Atomistic simulations face similar difficulties as phase separation can occur over microsecond timescales, which can be computationally expensive. In this work, we use a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model to screen plasticisers of varying flexibilities and geometries to build a pool-based active learning procedure which characterizes their design space and its effect on polymer/plasticiser miscibility. We perform an active learning cycle with a random forest model and an uncertainty/random hybrid query strategy to determine the miscibility behaviour of queried molecules. This is evaluated through computationally expensive, coarse-grained polymer/plasticiser simulations of a cis-(1,4)-polyisoprene melt filled with small hydrocarbon additives of varying sizes and rigidities. Through this, we are able to efficiently improve model performance in order to make predictions on the entire PL design space. Such findings enable us to determine a new set of general plasticiser design rules, suitable for non-polar molecules, which expands on our previous work. To further prove this, we perform atomistic simulations of polyisoprene/plasticiser systems which are approximately back-mapped from their coarse-grained equivalents. Our findings indicate that the polyisoprene/plasticiser phase behaviour, observed using the coarse-grained model for PLs in the absence of side chains, is valid.</p>

            <p>Oxynitrides are used in a variety of applications including photocatalysts, high-k dielectrics or wear-resistant coatings and often show intriguing multi-functionality. To accelerate the co-optimization of the relevant material properties of these compositionally complex oxynitride systems, high-throughput synthesis and characterization methods are desirable. In the present work, three approaches were investigated to obtain orthogonal anion and cation gradients on the same substrate by magnetron sputtering. The different approaches included varying positions of the local reactive gas inlets and different combinations of target materials. The best performing approach was applied to screen a large two-dimensional area of the quaternary phase space within the Al-Si-O-N system. This material system is a promising candidate for transparent protective coatings with variable refractive indices. With only five depositions of combinatorial libraries, an anion composition range of 2-46% O/(N+O) and a cation composition range of 4-44% Si/(Al+Si) is covered. For lower oxygen and silicon contents, a region with hardness of up to 25 GPa is observed, where the material exhibits either wurtzite AlN or a composite microstructure. By increasing the deposition temperature to 400 °C, an extension of this region can be achieved. At higher oxygen and silicon contents, the structure of the samples is X-ray amorphous. In this structural region, an intimate correlation between hardness and refractive index is confirmed. The results of this study introduce a practical approach to perform high-throughput development of mixed anion materials, which is transferable to many materials systems and applications.</p>

            <p>High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carta, Iurii Timrov, Sophie Beck, Claude Ederer</p>
            <p>The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions to define the underlying basis sets. We demonstrate good quantitative agreement between LRT and cRPA in cases where the strongly interacting subspace corresponds to an isolated set of bands. Differences can be assigned to neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and the presence of additional screening channels in LRT. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work clarifies the relation between both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingyue Han, Xiaoran Liu, Mikhail Kareev, Jak Chakhalian, Liang Wu</p>
            <p>Pyrochlore iridates have attracted significant interest due to their complex phase behavior arising from the interplay among electron correlations, quantum metric in flat bands, geometrically frustrated lattices, and topology induced by strong spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we focus on Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ thin films oriented along the (111) crystallographic direction. This quantum material, identified as an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect in transport experiments. Here we employ optical circular dichroism microscopy, to directly image ferroic octupole order and resolve all-in--all-out and all-out--all-in antiferromagnetic domains below the Néel temperature. Remarkably, despite the absence of a detectable net magnetic moment at zero applied magnetic field, we detected a large magnetic circular dichroism signal ($\sim 10^{-4}$) and Kerr effect ($\sim 10^{-4}$ radians) in zero magnetic field attributable to Berry curvature effects from Weyl nodes. Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is a non-collinear magnet with vanishing net moment and magnetic octupole order, similar to the recently proposed collinear d-wave altermagnets, allowing for magneto-optical responses and anomalous Hall effect. This finding likely represents the first demonstration of magnetic circular dichroism and Kerr effect in a topologically non-trivial quantum antiferromagnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Our work opens up the possibility of ultrafast domain switching in the terahertz frequency and the domain wall dynamics in the magnetic Weyl systems, which establishes the foundation for topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the anomalous proximity effect in a ballistic normal metal/diffusive normal metal/superconductor junction based on Rashba semiconductor nanowire model. The system hosts two distinct phases: a trivial helical phase with zero-energy Andreev Bound States and a topological phase with Majorana Bound States. We analyze the local density of states and induced pair correlations at the edge of the normal metal region. We investigate their behavior under scalar onsite disorder and changing the Superconductor and diffusive regions lengths in the trivial helical and topological phases. We find that both phases exhibit a zero-energy peak in the local density of states and spin-triplet pair correlations in the clean limit, which we attribute primarily to odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs. Disorder rapidly splits the zero-energy peak in the trivial helical phase regardless of the lengths of the superconductor and diffusive normal regions. The zero-energy peak in the topological phase show similar fragility when the superconductor region is short. However, for long superconductor regions, the zero-energy peak in the topological phase remain robust against disorder. In contrast, spin-singlet correlations are suppressed near zero energy in both phases. Our results highlight that the robustness of the zero-energy peak against scalar disorder, contingent on the Superconductor region length, serves as a key indicator distinguishing trivial Andreev bound states from topological Majorana bound states.</p>

            <p>The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in deforested regions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Roccati</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</p>

            <p>We consider rigorous consequences of modular invariance for two-dimensional unitary non-rational CFTs with $c > 1$. Simple estimates for the torus partition function can lead to remarkably strong results. We show in particular that the spectral density of spin-$J$ operators must grow like $\exp\left( \pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}(c-1) J} \right)/\sqrt{2J}$ in any twist interval at or above $(c-1)/12$, with a known twist-dependent prefactor. This proves that the large $J$ spectrum becomes dense even without averaging over spins. For twists below $(c-1)/12$ we establish that the growth must be strictly slower. Finally, we estimate how fast the maximal gap between two spin-$J$ operators must go to zero as $J$ becomes large.</p>

            <p>Recent advances have defined nontrivial phases of matter in open quantum systems, such as many-body quantum states subject to environmental noise. In this work, we experimentally probe and characterize mixed-state phases on Quantinuum's H1 quantum computer using two measures: Renyi correlators and the coding performance of a quantum error-correcting code associated with the phase. As a concrete example, we probe the low-energy states of the critical transverse field Ising model under different dephasing noise channels. First, we employ shadow tomography to observe a newly proposed Renyi correlator in two distinct phases: one exhibiting power-law decay and the other long-ranged. Second, we investigate the decoding fidelity of the associated quantum error-correcting code using a variational quantum circuit, and we find that a shallow circuit is sufficient to distinguish the above-mentioned two mixed-state phases through the decoding performance quantified by entanglement fidelity. Our work is a proof of concept for the quantum simulation and characterization of mixed-state phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline E. P . Robin</p>
            <p>We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</p>

            <h2>A Data-Driven Method for Modeling Creep-Fatigue Stress-Strain Behavior Using Neural ODEs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Deng, Mark C. Messner</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a data-driven machine learning approach for modeling one-dimensional stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading, utilizing experimental data from the nickel-based Alloy 617. The study employs uniaxial creep-fatigue test data acquired under various loading histories and compares two distinct neural network-based ODE models. The first model, known as the black-box model, comprehensively describes the strain-stress relationship using a Neural ODE equation. To interpret this black-box model, we apply the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) technique, transforming the black-box model into an equation-based model using symbolic regression. The second model, the Neural flow rule model, incorporates Hooke's Law for the linear elastic component, with the nonlinear part characterized by a Neural ODE. Both models are trained with experimental data to accurately reflect the observed stress-strain behavior. We conduct a detailed comparison with the standard Chaboche model, which includes three back stresses. Our results demonstrate that the neural network-based ODE models precisely capture the experimental creep-fatigue mechanical behavior, exceeding the standard Chaboche model's accuracy. Furthermore, an interpretable model derived from the black-box neural ODE model through symbolic regression achieves accuracy comparable to the Chaboche model, enhancing its interpretability. The results highlight the potential of neural network-based ODE models to depict complex creep-fatigue behavior, eliminating the necessity for experts to define a specific, material-focused model form.</p>

Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.</p>

            <h2>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon B. Le, Dima Watkins</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</p>

            <h2>Fabrication-Directed Entanglement for Designing Chiral and Anisotropic Metamaterial Foams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Revier, Jeffrey Ian Lipton</p>
            <p>Entangled networks are fundamental in various systems, from biological structures to engineered materials. Current techniques for programming entanglement often rely on intricate chemistry or result in statistically homogeneous networks, limiting the ability to create spatially patterned structures with precisely engineered functions. Thus, a key challenge remains in developing approaches to program complex mechanical behaviors, such as anisotropy and chirality, within monolithic entangled structures. This work introduces Fabrication-Directed Entanglement (FDE), a methodology integrating viscous thread printing (VTP) and topology optimization (TO) to program the entanglement of a single homogeneous filament. By spatially adjusting VTP parameters (deposition height, speed), we control local coiling density, creating quasi-two-phase (dense/sparse) regions within a monolithic entangled foam. Topology optimization guides the placement of these regions to achieve target macroscopic mechanical properties. Here we show foam-like mechanical metamaterials with tunable compliance, rigidity, and chirality. Experimental testing and simulation confirm that FDE expands the achievable material property space compared to homogeneous VTP foams, enabling properties like tunable directional stiffness, Poisson's ratios from $\nu\approx0.06~\text{to}~0.56$, and novel significant normal-shear coupling ($\eta_{212}\approx0.72$) from a single base material. This approach offers a viable new pathway for designing complex, functional entangled foam structures with tailored mechanical behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Annealing Approximation in Master-Node Network Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. O. Hase, Anderson A. Ferreira, André C. R. Martins, Fernando F. Ferreira</p>
            <p>This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters - R measuring right-oriented influence and L measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</p>

            <h2>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryusuke Hisatomi, Alto Osada, Kotaro Taga, Haruka Komiyama, Takuya Takahashi, Shutaro Karube, Yoichi Shiota, Teruo Ono</p>
            <p>Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eirini Kolonelou, Anthony N. Papathanassiou</p>
            <p>Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends at mass ratio 3:1 with Nano - Graphene Platelet fillers constitute mechanically and thermally stable systems, which are used for developing piezoelectric devices. Blends host a fraction of water molecules absorbed by the poly(vinyl alcohol) phase. Dc conductivity and dielectric relaxation occur via fluctuation induced tunneling of electrons. Electric charge transport is affected by the glass transition of the polymer matrix and the rotational and translational dynamics of absorbed water molecules. In the present work, absorbed water was subtracted by annealing and pumping and, subsequently, dry blends were characterized by employing Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy at combined temperature and pressure states. Conductivity and relaxation obey fluctuation induced tunneling temperature dependencies. The corresponding activation energies and activation volumes reveal the role of absorbed polar water molecules on the tunneling current for macroscopic or localized electron transport.</p>

            <h2>Chess variation entropy and engine relevance for humans</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Barthelemy</p>
            <p>Modern chess engines significantly outperform human players and are essential for evaluating positions and move quality. These engines assign a numerical evaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black, but similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some move sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting the practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this problem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation (the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy, while those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results show that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy variations, especially when $|E|<100$ centipawns, which accounts for about $2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to convey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed typical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> András Tárkányi, Viktor Ivády</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Ivan Soler Calero</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.</p>

            <p>Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</p>

            <p>Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) thin films facilitate strong light-matter interactions with a widespread impact in nonlinear, quantum and thermal photonics. Here, we extend the scope of thin film ENZ modes by elucidating the generalized polaritonic modes emerging from anisotropy and near-zero permittivity. Through a theoretical investigation of generalized ENZ polaritons on silicon carbide (SiC) metasurfaces, we reveal a complex polaritonic landscape, consisting of a seven-region phase diagram. We show that the complex interplay between material properties and geometry changes the nature of the modes, and we clarify when ENZ modes with closed and open isofrequency curves (IFCs) can be observed, and how they coexist with surface phonon-polaritons and hyperbolic modes. The associated photonic topological transitions are accompanied by phase velocity sign reversals and induce dramatic modifications of near-field profiles and Purcell enhancement factors. Our work merges insights from anisotropic and ENZ effects, enabling enhanced control over polariton behavior with broad implications for subwavelength optics, material design, nonlinear effects, thermal emission, and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the "deep Gaussian equivalence principle" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this "trivialisation" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered.</p>

            <p>Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</p>

            <p>We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states-a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, where hotter liquids freeze faster than warmer ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian plays critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Topological phases of matter commonly feature protected states at their boundaries. Transferring this protection to time-metamaterials is extremely challenging, as it requires the generation of an abrupt interface between two topologically distinct bulks. Here, we realize and measure an ultrafast topological non-Hermitian skin mode bound to an interface circulating within the cavity of a fast-gain semiconductor laser. The nonlinear stationary state generated in such devices features a jump in the instantaneous frequency. We show that this discontinuity gives rise to a topological interface for the field fluctuations in the system. Using direct intensity sampling, we experimentally measure the skin modes and their positioning at the frequency jump of the stationary state. Analysis of these isolated modes reveals an ultrashort full-width at half-maximum of 583 $\pm$ 16 fs. Furthermore, we show that we can tune the shape and relative timing shift of the skin modes via external bias modulation. Finally, both numerical and experimental analysis of the noise in the system reveal that field fluctuations are funneled into the topological interface. Our findings reveal a new way to generate topologically protected states of light in time, which paves the way for novel time-varying physics as well as metrological applications.</p>

Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.</p>

            <p>Realizing two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets is important for spintronics applications.

These coincident Van Hove singularities are a generic consequence of non-symmorphic symmetries in nine 2D space groups. Due to nontrivial symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian, these coincident Van Hove singularities allow new hopping interactions between the Van Hove singularities that do not appear in analogous Van Hove singularity based patch models for cuprates and graphene. We show these new interactions can give rise to various weak coupling, and BCS-based instabilities, including altermagnetism, nematicity, inter-band d-wave superconductivity, and orbital altermagnetic order. We apply our results to quasi-2D organic $\kappa$-Cl in which altermagnetism is known to appear.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.</p>

When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</p>

            <h2>Recoverable strain in amorphous materials: the role of ongoing plastic events following initial elastic recoil</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry A. Lockwood, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically strain recovery within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, significant further strain recovery then occurs more slowly via the plastic yielding of elements with negative local stresses, opposite to that of the original shear. We elucidate the mechanism that underlies this behaviour, in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements. In particular, we show that the initial fast elastic recoil brings to a state of negative local stress those elements that had yielded during the forward straining while the load was applied. The subsequent delayed plastic yielding of these elements with negative stress is the origin of the slow ongoing strain recovery. In this way, counterintuitively, elements that had yielded plastically while the load was applied still contribute significantly to strain recovery after the sample is unloaded. This finding has important consequences for constitutive modeling, because such behaviour can only arise in a constitutive model that evolves a full distribution of local stresses (or multiple moments of such a distribution), rather than a single average stress.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shantonu Mukherjee, Amitabha Lahiri</p>
            <p>The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a Néel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Magnons from time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory and nonempirical Hubbard functionals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Binci, Nicola Marzari, Iurii Timrov</p>
            <p>Spin excitations play a fundamental role in understanding magnetic properties of materials, and have significant technological implications for magnonic devices. However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-wave spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using nonempirical Hubbard functionals. This approach is implemented in a general noncollinear formulation, enabling the study of magnons in both collinear and noncollinear magnetic systems. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state, and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non-empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. Furthermore, the method satisfies the Goldstone condition without requiring empirical rescaling of the exchange-correlation kernel or explicit enforcement of sum rules, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art techniques. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the fundamental role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.</p>

Whereas EQ can entail observables $(U, V, N)$, dynamics has (node populations, edge traffic, cycle flux). We derive forces of NEQ, fluctuation-susceptibility equalities, Maxwell-Onsager-like symmetry relations, and we generalize to ``cost-benefit'' relations beyond just work and heat dissipation.</p>

            <p>In a companion paper [arXiv:2410.09277], we outlined a general theory for nonequilibrium (NEQ) network statistical physics, $\textit{Caliber Force Theory}$, (CFT). It resembles the "First and Second Laws" basis of Equilibrium (EQ) Thermodynamics, except that dynamics requires maximization of $\textit{path entropy}$ ($\mathfrak{S}_\text{path}$), not $\textit{state entropy}$. Here, we elaborate the mathematics of the forces $(\text{d} \mathfrak{S}_\text{path}/\text{d}{\textbf{x}})$, the fluctuation-respond relations, and the Maxwell-Onsager-like symmetry relations. And we give applications beyond thermal baths -- such as networks in ecology, biochemistry, vehicle traffic, and other force-flow networks. Beyond past work on inequalities, it gives equalities; and it gives forces, which allows for studies of optimization, conflicts, congestion and network design; and it gives a third Kirchhoff-like relation that applies to networks that have fluctuating flows.</p>

            <p>Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</p>

A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</p>

            <p>Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</p>

            <p>Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.</p>

            <p>Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</p>

Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons).

            <p>Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the Néel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the Néel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the Néel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Guy Caputo, Nathan Rouxelin</p>
            <p>Type II superconductors can trap a transient magnetic field and become "cryomagnets" that are very useful for applications. During this process, flux jumps i.e. sudden jumps of the total magnetization occur and hinder the properties of these magnets. To understand the electrodynamics of these systems and in particular flux jumps, we analyzed mathematically a model based on Maxwell's equations and temperature in a 1D configuration. When a magnetic pulse is applied to a superconductor, three effects occur, from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the problem, we obtain a nonlinear diffusion for the magnetic field coupled to a forced diffusion equation for the temperature with only two parameters. Two regimes occur, depending on temperature: for medium temperature the heat capacity of a sample can be assumed constant while for low temperature it depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. Flux jumps can be explained using the fixed points of the equations. We found that they occur for pulses of duration close to the magnetic relaxation time and mostly at low temperature because of the nonlinear dependance. Flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitude long duration pulses and low to medium temperatures, so these conditions are optimal to produce better cryomagnets.</p>

            <p>From nanoscale devices including sensors, electronics, or biocompatible coatings to macroscale structural, automotive or aerospace components, fundamental understanding of plasticity and fracture can guide the realization of materials that ensure safe and durable performance. Identifying the role of atomic-scale plasticity is crucial, especially for applications relying on brittle ceramics. Here, stress-intensity-controlled atomistic simulations of fracture in cubic Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N model systems demonstrate how $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$-scale plasticity - manifested as lattice distortions, phase transformation, nucleation and emission of dislocations - substantially affects the macroscale fracture toughness (K$_{Ic}$) and fracture strength (${\sigma}$$_{f}$) of brittle ceramics. The extent of plastic deformation in Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N increases monotonically with the Al content (x), due to a corresponding decrease in cubic $\rightarrow$ hexagonal polymorph transition energies and unstable stacking fault energies. Overall, plasticity positively affects the mechanical properties, resulting in optimal combinations of strength and toughness for x~0.6. However, for x exceeding ~0.7, the benefits of plasticity diminish. The initial rise followed by a decline in K$_{Ic}$(x) and ${\sigma}$$_{f}$(x) is explained based on the interplay between phase transformation, shear-induced faulting, and tensile cleavage on the easiest fracture plane. The results highlight the impact of atomic-scale plasticity on observable properties and point to strategies for toughening ceramics through control of polymorph competition.</p>

            <p>Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.</p>

            <p>Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.</p>

By leveraging molecular dynamics for atomic configuration sampling and deep learning-enabled rapid Hamiltonian evaluation, our approach enables large-scale simulations of temperature-dependent optical properties using advanced XC functionals (HSE, SCAN). Demonstrated on silicon and gallium arsenide across temperature 100-400 K, the method accurately captures phonon-induced bandgap renormalization and indirect/direct absorption processes which are in excellent agreement with experimental findings over five orders of magnitude.

            <p>Physical reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for exploiting the inherent nonlinear dynamics of physical systems to perform computational tasks. Recently, we presented the magnon-scattering reservoir, whose internal nodes are given by the fundamental wave-like excitations of ferromagnets called magnons. These excitations can be geometrically-quantized and, in response to an external stimulus, show transient nonlinear scattering dynamics that can be harnessed to perform memory and nonlinear transformation tasks. Here, we test a magnon-scattering reservoir in a single magnetic disk in the vortex state towards two key performance indicators for physical reservoir computing, the short-term memory and parity-check tasks. Using time-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we measure the evolution of the reservoir's spectral response to an input sequence consisting of random binary inputs encoded in microwave pulses with two distinct frequencies. Two different output spaces of the reservoir are defined, one based on the time-averaged frequency spectra and another based on temporal multiplexing. Our results demonstrate that the memory and nonlinear transformation capability do not depend on the chosen read-out scheme as long as the dimension of the output space is large enough to capture all nonlinear features provided by the magnon-magnon interactions. This further shows that solely the nonlinear magnons in the physical system, not the read-out, determine the reservoir's capacity.</p>

            <h2>Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debjani Das Gupta, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.</p>

            <p>Approaching phase boundaries in many-body systems can give rise to intriguing signatures in their excitation spectra. Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.</p>

            <p>The study of fibre networks is of great importance due to their appearance in a wide range of natural and industrial processes. These networks are particularly complex because their properties depend not only on the characteristics of individual fibres but also on their collective arrangements within the network. In this study, we investigate the case of nylon fibre aggregates that were generated in a turbulent von Karman flow. The key properties of these aggregates are characterized, including their three-dimensional structures, analysed through X-ray tomography, and their mechanical responses. The results are compared with those observed for aegagropilae, a natural fibre aggregate commonly found on the Mediterranean sea shore</p>

            <p>Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powder samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. For single crystalline samples, $\epsilon$' can be sustained to remain above 10$^5$ and the dissipation factor below 10 in the temperature region of 280-340 K after a simple 'activation' process. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are amongst one of the highest in all known materials. We propose a model suggesting the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level.

            <p>Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are a leading candidate for advanced memory and computing applications. Epitaxial-like growth of chalcogenide thin films at the wafer scale is important to guarantee the homogeneity of the thin film but is challenging with magnetron sputtering, particularly for the growth of phase-change heterostructure (PCH), such as TiTe2/Sb2Te3. In this work, we report how to obtain highly textured TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films with atomically sharp interfaces on standard silicon substrates. By combining atomic-scale characterization and ab initio simulations, we reveal the critical role of the Sb2Te3 seed layer in forming a continuous Si-Sb-Te mixed transition layer, which provides a wafer-scale flat surface for the subsequent epitaxial-like growth of TiTe2/Sb2Te3 thin film. By gradually reducing the thickness of the seed layer, we determine its critical limit to be ~2 nm. Non-negligible in-plane tensile strain was observed in the TiTe2 slabs due to the lattice mismatch with the adjacent Sb2Te3 ones, suggesting that the chemical interaction across the structural gaps in the heterostructure is stronger than a pure van der Waals interaction. Finally, we outline the potential choices of chalcogenides for atomically flat seed layers on standard silicon substrates, which can be used for wafer-scale synthesis of other high-quality PCM or PCH thin films.</p>

            <h2>Majorana polarization in disordered heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubhanshu Karoliya, Sumanta Tewari, Gargee Sharma</p>
            <p>Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a quasi-1d system, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^*_\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}_\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. Our conclusions remain robust irrespective of the chosen definition of Majorana polarization, whether based on chiral or the particle-hole framework. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP with energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress. In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs. By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations. Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.</p>

            <p>We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helical spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helical graphene structures. We model the helical graphene surface as a smooth, continuous, and distortion-free manifold, effectively adopting the continuum approximation. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helical background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helical pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helical graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <h2>$\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$: An $\textit{ab-initio}$ python 3 code to calculate Berry Curvature dependent Anomalous Hall Conductivity in any material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in materials has long been a topic of debate. Studies reveal that AHC originates from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of Bloch states. Accurate computation of AHC is crucial for predicting material properties and guiding experimental studies in topological and spintronic applications. Traditional approaches often rely on wannier interpolation, which can introduce inaccuracies and computational overhead. Also, reliability of the wannierization technique becomes questionable when the bands are highly entangled and dispersive. This demands the calculation of AHC using the $\textit{first-principle}$ approach. Here, we present $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$, a Python 3 based code that directly computes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ and AHC using WIEN2k output. Since, WIEN2k employs an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method, $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ provides highly accurate AHC results. The code efficiently handles large $\textbf{k}$-grids by parallelizing $\boldsymbol\Omega$ computations over $\textbf{k}$-points. Also, it stores band-resolved $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in a binary file, thereby greatly reducing the required storage memory and allowing fast post-processing to compute AHC. $\textit{PY-BerryAHC}$ has been validated on well-known materials exhibiting AHC. These include- Fe, Fe$_3$Ge & Co$_2$FeAl. At 300 K, the calculated magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ for Fe & Fe$_3$Ge is found to be 744 $S/cm$ & 311 $S/cm$, respectively. For Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of $\sigma_{xy}$ is obtained to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$ and is found to be constant with the change in temperature from 0-300 K. These results are in good agreement with previously reported theoretical and experimental data. This ensures the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the code. The code is also provided with a post-processing tool to visualize $\boldsymbol\Omega$.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed investigation of an overlooked symmetry structure in non-collinear antiferromagnets that gives rise to an emergent quantum number for magnons. Focusing on the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we show that its spin order parameter transforms under an enlarged symmetry group, $\mathrm{SO(3)_L \times SO(2)_R}$, rather than the conventional spin-rotation group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. Although this larger symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state, a residual subgroup survives, leading to conserved Noether charges that, upon quantization, endow magnons with an additional quantum number -- \emph{isospin} -- beyond their energy and momentum. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding symmetry, degeneracy, and quantum numbers in non-collinear magnetic systems, and bridge an unexpected connection between the paradigms of symmetry breaking in non-collinear antiferromagnets and chiral symmetry breaking in particle physics.</p>

            <p>Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450°C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400°C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</p>

We show from electrical transport measurements that two dimensional (2D) superconductivity arises at the heterointerface below temperature $T \sim 12$~K. When capped with a 2D ferromagnet (CrTe$_2$), these heterostructures show a superconducting diode effect with efficiency of about 30\%. With strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe$_2$, these epitaxial heterostructures provide an attractive epitaxial vdW platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity in Dirac semimetals and for developing non-reciprocal devices for superconducting electronics.</p>

This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.</p>

We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity.

Using the masses of the Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) as input, we rule out the possibility for universal bound states of three B and B* mesons arising from the Efimov effect based on their spin-isospin structure. As a consequence, we can predict the phase shifts for the scattering of B and B* mesons off the exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) to leading order in a non-relativistic effective field theory with contact interactions based on two-body information alone.</p>

            <p>Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</p>

            <p>The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</p>

The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</p>

Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</p>

Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D.

            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-generalized gradient approximation density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</p>

            <h2>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Hino, Yuki Kurashige</p>
            <p>A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range.

            <h2>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhang, Jing-Yuan Chen</p>
            <p>Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg, Joel Maldonado</p>
            <p>Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa</p>
            <p>In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable Lévy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Slongo, Cristian Micheletti</p>
            <p>We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</p>

            <h2>Equivalence of effective actions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Falls</p>
            <p>For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</p>

            <p>Identifying and studying the underlying two-electron interactions that give rise to emergent phenomena is a key step in developing a holistic understanding of quantum materials. This step is hindered by the lack of an experiment that can directly interrogate the interactions and the specific quasiparticles involved in the interaction simultaneously. We introduce correlation-ARPES (C-ARPES) as a new experimental method that overcomes this difficulty and directly measures the interactions between specific, chosen quasiparticles by measuring the correlations between two electrons photoemitted from the same pulse (but not the same photon). We illustrate how this technique can extract the underlying interactions, and demonstrate this with an example of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions, such as those that give rise to charge density waves through the Kohn anomaly mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingsheng Tian, Rhine Samajdar, Bryce Gadway</p>
            <p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states - fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states realized without an external magnetic field - in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers represents a significant development in condensed matter physics. Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-Driven Charge Frustration and Emergent Phases in the One-Dimensional Extended Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourabh Saha, Jeroen van den Brink, Manoranjan Kumar, Satoshi Nishimoto</p>
            <p>Frustration is a key driver of exotic quantum phases, yet its role in charge dynamics remains largely unexplored. We show that charge frustration - induced by electronic polarization effects - stabilizes unconventional insulating states in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group, we uncover a charge-disordered phase that remains insulating despite lacking long-range order and possessing an effectively attractive on-site interaction - a behavior reminiscent of gapful spin liquids in frustrated spin systems. We also identify a fragile ferroelectric phase and a charge-density-wave state with emergent eight-site periodicity. These findings establish charge frustration, driven by charge-dipole interactions, as a robust mechanism for realizing exotic phases in low-dimensional correlated systems, with implications for organic conductors, transition-metal oxides, and ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen</p>
            <p>The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi2Te4 coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi2Te4. This sliding mechanism breaks the MzT and PT symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin-polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts.</p>

            <h2>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Ma, Marin Soljačić</p>
            <p>In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> X. R. Wang</p>
            <p>Nanoscale bilayers containing at least one magnetic layer exhibit universal unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance (UAMR) and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). They are currently understood through various mechanisms related to the interconversion of charge current and spin current, giant magnetoresistance, thermal magnonic effects, thermoelectric effects, and diverse spindependent scattering processes. This raises a fundamental question: do the universal behaviors observed in a wide range of systems stem from underlying general principles? We demonstrate here that both UAMR and UMR arise from electron transport influenced by the magnetization vector present in the magnetic material and the interfacial potential inherent in heterostructures. Specifically, UAMR represents current-independent resistance (resistivity) of bilayers. UMR is the resistance proportional to the current although electron transports of the bilayers are the linear response to high current densities and their induced thermal gradients. Our theory introduces a novel approach that considers the interplay between the magnetization vector, thermal gradients, and the effective internal electric field at the interface. This framework provides a unified explanation for both UMR and UAMR, effectively capturing key experimental features such as dependence on current direction, magnetization orientation, film thickness, and magnetic field strength. Furthermore, it offers a universal perspective that bridges UMR and UAMR effects, enhancing our understanding of spin-dependent transport phenomena in bilayers.</p>

Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Puibasset</p>
            <p>We investigate the transient bubbles that spontaneously appear in a simple liquid using molecular simulations. The objective is to deduce the free-energy of formation of the bubbles $W(s)$ from the bubble size distribution $p(s)$ through the hypothesis of a Boltzmann distribution: $W(s) = -kT \ln p(s)$. The bubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid superimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We first investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice, and show that using several mesh values allows to detect bubbles in a wide range of sizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can then be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis in the region of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first show that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size is characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution diverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before calculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical expansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this observation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small bubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added to the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the free-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of the tiny bubbles.</p>

            <p>The integration of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ferroelectric substrates is a powerful strategy to modulate their electronic and optical properties. However, the use of relaxor ferroelectrics for this purpose remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a reversible photoluminescence (PL) and charge density modulation of monolayer $MoS_{2}$ on a $Sr_{0.61}Ba_{0.39}Nb_{2}O_{6}$ (SBN) substrate, a prototypical relaxor ferroelectric. The smearing of the phase transition in SBN enables continuous tuning of $MoS_{2}$ electronic properties over a broad temperature range ($30-90°C$). A pronounced PL enhancement occurs as the substrate transitions from ferro-to-paraelectric phase due to the vanishing spontaneous polarization and the consequent change in charge balance at the $MoS_{2}-SBN$ interface. Moreover, thermal hysteresis in the electron density modulation is observed during heating and cooling cycles. These findings highlight the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics as reconfigurable platforms for electron doping and light-emission control in 2D materials, opening avenues for temperature-responsive optoelectronic and nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <p>The $p$-orbital doublet in a honeycomb lattice is concretely studied with interacting spinless fermions at half filling. The Dirac fermions with linear dispersion at $\pm K$ valleys govern the non-interacting low-energy physics. In the weak-coupling regime, the Dirac fermions are gaped due to the spontaneous generation of mass terms through a uniform axial orbital ordering, rendering the system into the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase with a nonzero Chern number. Surprisingly, the intermediate many-particle interaction produces the intervalley coherence between $\pm K$ valleys by developing complex polar orbital orderings in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell. This phase is shown to have a deep connection with the low-energy physical behavior described by the orbital exchange model in the Mott insulating phase. The classical ground-state manifold in the Mott regime enjoys a continuous symmetry characterized by the intervalley coherent phase. Finally, the quantum fluctuation selects a unique ground state with emergent Kekulé orbitons through the order-by-disorder mechanism. Our findings provide insights for a direction of searching for Kekulé distortion in correlated multi-orbital systems.</p>

            <h2>Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Coquinot, Mathieu Lizée, Lydéric Bocquet, Nikita Kavokine</p>
            <p>The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</p>

            <h2>Machine-learning interatomic potentials from a users perspective: A comparison of accuracy, speed and data efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Leimeroth, Linus C. Erhard, Karsten Albe, Jochen Rohrer</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have massively changed the field of atomistic modeling. They enable the accuracy of density functional theory in large-scale simulations while being nearly as fast as classical interatomic potentials. Over the last few years, a wide range of different types of MLIPs have been developed, but it is often difficult to judge which approach is the best for a given problem setting. For the case of structurally and chemically complex solids, namely Al-Cu-Zr and Si-O, we benchmark a range of machine learning interatomic potential approaches, in particular, the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP), moment tensor potentials (MTP), the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) in its linear and nonlinear version, neural equivariant interatomic potentials (NequIP), Allegro, and MACE. We find that nonlinear ACE and the equivariant, message-passing graph neural networks NequIP and MACE form the Pareto front in the accuracy vs. computational cost trade-off. In case of the Al-Cu-Zr system we find that MACE and Allegro offer the highest accuracy, while NequIP outperforms them for Si-O. Furthermore, GPUs can massively accelerate the MLIPs, bringing them on par with and even ahead of non-accelerated classical interatomic potentials (IPs) with regards to accessible timescales. Finally, we explore the extrapolation behavior of the corresponding potentials, probe the smoothness of the potential energy surfaces, and finally estimate the user friendliness of the corresponding fitting codes and molecular dynamics interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laya Parkavousi, Suropriya Saha</p>
            <p>The mean compositions of individual components can be tuned to control phase behavior in number-conserving passive mixtures. In this work, we investigate the role of variable average density in a system of infinitely many non-reciprocally interacting scalar densities, within the framework of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Computation of the Long-Range Exact Exchange using an Extended Screening Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Kokott, Volker Blum, Matthias Scheffler</p>
            <p>We introduce a computationally efficient screening for the Coulomb potential that also allows calculating approximated long-range exact exchange contributions with an accuracy similar to an explicit full-range evaluation of the exact exchange. Starting from the screening function of the HSE functional, i.e., the complementary error function, as zeroth order, a first-order Taylor expansion in terms of the screening parameter {\omega} is proposed as an approximation of the long-range Coulomb potential. The resulting extended screening function has a similar spatial extend as the complementary error function leading to a computational speed comparable to screened hybrid functionals such as HSE06, but with long-range exact exchange contributions included. The approach is tested and demonstrated for prototypical semiconductors and organic crystals using the PBE0 functional. Predicted energy band gaps, total energies, cohesive energies, and lattice energies from the first-order approximated PBE0 functional are close to those from the unmodified PBE0 functional, but are obtained at significantly reduced computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Studying the Seebeck coefficient and exploring the possibility of enhancing ZT upto 1.8 for NaCo$_2$O$_4$ in high temperature region</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Raj, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>Here, we have studied the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient (S) of the NaCo$_2$O$_4$ (NCO) by using experimental and computational methods. The range of experimentally obtained S is $\sim$55 to 103 $\mu$V/K in the temperature range of 300-600 K, which confirms the p-type behaviour of NCO. The electronic structure of this compound is obtained via DFT+U formalism. The band dispersion and partial density of states confirms the magnetic and half metallic nature. Furthermore, in the transport properties, the obtained S using a U = 4 eV gives the best match with experimental data. The temperature and chemical potential dependent S$^{2}$$\sigma$$/$$\tau$ is calculated using the obtained electronic transport properties, in which the maximum value obtained for p(n)-type doping is $\sim$22(61)$\times$10$^1$$^4$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The possibility of enhancing the ZT is identified, and it is calculated in temperature range 300-1200 K. The maximum calculated value of ZT is 0.64 for p-type and 1.8 for n-type doping at 1200 K. The calculated carrier concentration obtained for p(n) type doping at 1200 K is $\sim$1.17 (1.6)$\times$10$^2$$^2$ cm$^-$$^3$. This study suggests that the careful doping of p and n type can enhance the applicability of this compound in thermoelectric for high temperature application.</p>

            <h2>Hidden Quantum State and Signature of Mott Transition in Two-dimensional 1T-TaS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Kumar, Birender Singh, Pradeep Kumar</p>
            <p>Here we report a comprehensive inelastic light scattering studies on 1T-TaS2 with different thickness. This compound is well known for its rich charge density wave phases. Along with that it has been one of the promising candidates for a quantum spin liquid state as the spins reside on a triangular lattice and it does not show any signature of magnetic ordering. We performed a thickness dependent Raman measurement in a regime of completely commensurate charge density wave (C-CDW) to a nearly commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) with varying temperature (4K-330K) and polarization direction of the incident light. We observed the signature of CDW transition and in addition to that we have also found the signature of a well sought hidden quantum CDW state at low temperature around TH ~ 80K. The emergence of CDW, both normal and hidden one, is marked by the emergence of new phonon modes and distinct renormalized phonon self-energy parameters for the most prominent modes. A transition from metallic to the Mott insulating state is gauged via the Raman response using low frequency slope , reflected in the renormalized slope below TCDW and TH.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiu-Cai Jiang, Li-Ya Qiao, Yu-Zhong Zhang</p>
            <p>Using the density functional theory calculations, we predict that several monolayer chromium-based materials exhibit a triple-Q tetrahedral magnetic insulating ground state. By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi$\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.</p>

            <h2>Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eemeli A. Eronen, Johannes Niskanen</p>
            <p>We report a statistical simulation of the UV-visible absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure-spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S2 line occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N-N bond within the C-N=N-C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</p>

We investigate this concept, reviewing the possible contribution of semi-classical electrodynamics to nuclear interactions, specifically focusing on the Casimir effect at sub-Fermi length scales. The main result is a temperature distance relation, derived from the time-energy uncertainty relation, which can have observable consequences at these extreme scales. From a more general perspective, since the energy-time uncertainty relation appears to be a significant physical quantity, we also provide a brief overview of recent developments in this direction in Sec. 3.2.</p>

While density functional theory excels at capturing atomic-scale behavior, it remains computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations required to explore complex phenomena. Our model addresses this limitation by accurately reproducing key properties of PbTiO3, including domain wall dynamics and skyrmion formation, which are known as key features to next-generation memory and energy-efficient technologies. Validated against DFT data, the model remains predictive across a wide range of conditions. It offers an accessible and efficient framework for high-accuracy large-scale simulations, allowing deeper insights into PbTiO3 and its potential applications.</p>

            <p>Efficient electrical capacitive control is important for the next generation of ultra-low-power and ultra-fast electronics and energy-storage devices. Correlated electronic phases offer a powerful route to enhancing field-effect control beyond the limits of conventional capacitive gating. In such systems, modest gate voltages can couple to an order parameter, producing responses far larger than expected from the electrostatics of non-interacting carriers. It was demonstrated that electron-electron interactions, in which the exchange and correlation energies among electrons lower the chemical potential of an electron system as the electron density increases, can significantly increase the effective capacitance over its geometric capacitance value. Here, we show that the electron-lattice or electron-phonon correlations in charge density wave (CDW) condensate can lead to a giant gate response with the corresponding capacitance enhancement. This unusual phenomenon is demonstrated in the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material, where the gate-induced change in CDW charge density exceeds predictions based on geometrical gate capacitance by one to two orders of magnitude. This "giant gating" effect arises from the coupling of the electric field to the CDW electron-lattice condensate, demonstrating a mechanism for massively amplifying gate response via collective electronic behavior. We quantify the effect by determining the quantum capacitance of the CDW charge and by constructing a band diagram for the gated CDW device. The obtained results can lead to an alternative strategy for continuing the downscaling of the transistor feature size in electronic technology.</p>

            <h2>Role of Noise on Defect Formation and Correlations in a Long-Range Ising Model Under Adiabatic Driving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Santanu Dhara, Suhas Gangadharaiah</p>
            <p>We study an exactly solvable long-range (LR) transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with a power-law decaying interaction characterized by a decay exponent {\alpha}. In the thermodynamic limit, the system is adiabatically driven in the presence of noise, from a paramagnetic phase with all spins down to one with all spins up. Our study examines the role of long-range interactions on the defect density, its distribution, and spin correlations, comparing noisy and noiseless scenarios. In the noiseless case, within the long-range regime, the steady-state properties are primarily influenced by modes near the k = {\pi} region. However, in the presence of noise, the dominant contributions shift to the modes near k = 0. This differs from the SR model, where previous studies have shown that modes around k = {\pi}/2 play a significant role under noisy conditions. In the absence of noise, defect density scales as $n\propto \tau_Q^{-1/2}$, implying scaling exponent independent of decay exponent. However, we find that decreasing the value of {\alpha} (i.e., increasing the range) enhances the defect density, whereas in the presence of noise, it is suppressed. In the LR regime, two-point fermionic correlators initially exhibit Gaussian decay, followed by quadratic suppression instead of power-law decay for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Meanwhile, spin correlators, expressed as a string of fermionic operators, undergo purely exponential decay with no crossover behavior. Furthermore, our analysis of defect formation reveals the influence of LR interaction on the kink-number distribution and its cumulants.</p>

            <p>The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.</p>

            <p>The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</p>

            <p>Magnetic shape-memory (MSM) Heuslers show a strong coupling between magnetic and structural characteristics, evidencing a correlation between magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties through a magnetostructural martensitic transformation. This functional aspect makes MSM Heuslers promising for integration into smart micro/nanodevices, including sensors, energy harvesters, and actuators. Controlling the martensitic microstructure, which determines the magnetic characteristics, is among the key points for optimization of the magnetic functional properties of these materials at different length scales. Here, we report a strategy for manipulating the magnetic properties of spatially confined epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films grown on Cr(001)//MgO(001) by twinning configuration engineering in the low-temperature ferromagnetic (martensitic) phase. We show how the twinning configurations in the continuous films and the micropatterned structures can be switched from Y-type (showing negligible magnetic stray field) into X-type (presenting significant magnetic stray field) by a post-annealing process. Advanced characterization techniques enable us to analyze the atomic structure and the surface quality of the annealed samples and to disentangle the twin-switching phenomenon. The martensitic microstructure engineering reported in this study introduces a simple method for promoting the magnetic stray-field contribution at the surface of Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial thin films and micropatterns initially showing a negligible magnetic stray field.</p>

            <p>Fe$_2$GeTe$_3$ is a paradigmatic van der Waals magnet with the full microscopic picture of magnetic interactions still under debate. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 1.1 K to map out the low-energy physics on the surface. In agreement with previous works, we observe a spatially varying Fano lineshape that has been ascribed to a Kondo resonance. In addition, we identify a small gap of $\approx$ 5 meV width on top of the larger-energy Fano resonance. We suggest that this gap is the signature of a coherent Kondo lattice that has been proposed to originate from hybridization of a strongly dispersing and a flat band both derived from $d$ electrons of the Fe atoms in the lattice. Adding magnetic adatoms on the surface hardly influences the magnetic signatures of the substrate, indicating the robustness of the intralayer Kondo correlations against magnetic adsorbates.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear magnets with near-zero net magnetization and nontrivial bulk electronic topology hold significant promise for spintronic applications, though their scarcity necessitates purposeful design strategies. In this work, we report a topologically nontrivial electronic structure in metallic Mn_2PdIn, which crystallizes in the inverse Heusler structure and exhibits a spin-glassy ground state with quenched magnetization. The system features Weyl-type band crossings near the Fermi level and reveals a novel interplay among momentum-space nesting, orbital hybridization, and spin-orbit coupling. Comprehensive transport measurements uncover a pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Mn_2PdIn. The observed quadratic relationship between the longitudinal and anomalous Hall resistivities highlights the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution to AHE. These findings establish inverse Heusler alloys as compelling platforms for realizing noncollinear magnets that host Weyl-type semimetallic or metallic phases-combining suppressed magnetization with robust electronic transport-thereby offering a promising route toward their seamless integration into next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle, Laura Classen</p>
            <p>Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. In particular, for the $d_{xy}$-wave model, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.</p>

            <p>Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>Pauli crystals are unique geometric structures of non-interacting fermions, resembling crystals, that emerge solely from Fermi statistics and confinement. Unlike genuine quantum crystals that arise from interparticle interactions, Pauli crystals do not break translation symmetry but nonetheless exhibit nontrivial many-body correlations. In this Letter, we explore Pauli crystal formation in a cavity-fermion setup. We analytically show that when coupled to a cavity, degeneracy in Pauli crystals can trigger zero-threshold transitions to superradiance. This superradiance is accompanied by the emergence of a genuine quantum crystalline state, wherein the atomic density is periodically modulated. We substantiate our findings using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The combined interplay between statistics, confinement geometry and interactions mediated by light thus facilitates a novel pathway to quantum crystallization.</p>

            <h2>Global Stress Generation and Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator under Dynamic Loading for Two-Phase Random Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tengfei Xing, Xiaodan Ren, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.</p>

            <h2>Entropy-based analysis of single-qubit Otto and Carnot heat engines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrés Vallejo, Catty Lissardy, Santiago Silva-Gallo, Alejandro Romanelli, Raul Donangelo</p>
            <p>From an entropy-based formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, we investigate the performance of Otto-like and Carnot-like engines for a single-qubit working medium. Within this framework, the first law includes an additional contribution -- coherence work -- that quantifies the energetic cost of deviating the quantum trajectory from its natural unitary evolution. We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</p>

            <h2>A note on the asymptotic uniformity of Markov chains with random rates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Calvert, Frank den Hollander, Dana Randall</p>
            <p>The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain is generally a complicated function of its transition rates. However, we show that if the transition rates are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution satisfying certain tail conditions, then the resulting stationary distribution is close in total variation distance to the distribution that is proportional to the inverse of the exit rates of the states. This result, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction of Chvykov et al. (2021), constitutes the first rigorous validation of an emerging physical theory of order in non-equilibrium systems. The proof entails showing that the stationary distribution of the corresponding "jump chain," i.e., the discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities given by the normalized transition rates, is asymptotically uniform as the number of states grows, which settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafaï (2012) under certain assumptions.</p>

            <h2>A computational framework for predicting the effect of surface roughness in fatigue</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Jiménez-Alfaro, E. Martínez-Pañeda</p>
            <p>Surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the fatigue life of structural components. Its effect is commonly quantified using a correction coefficient known as the surface factor. In this paper, a phase field based numerical framework is proposed to estimate the surface factor while accounting for the stochastic nature of surface roughness. The model is validated against existing experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, such as surface topology and failure strength. An important effect of surface roughness is observed when the average surface roughness increases and the correlation length of the surface profile decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced with higher failure strengths.</p>

            <p>Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.</p>

            <h2>Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier E. Santos, Agnese Marcato, Roman Colman, Nicholas Lubbers, Yen Ting Lin</p>
            <p>Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack Clarke, Pascal Neveu, Ewold Verhagen, Michael R. Vanner</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</p>

            <p>Discovering and classifying non-trivial mixed states and mixed state phase transitions are some of the most important current issues in condensed matter and quantum information. In this study, we investigate some non-trivial mixed states and phase transitions between them by using the second Rényi conditional mutual information (CMI). The CMI can measure mixed state ``gap'', estimated by the exponential decay rate of the second Rényi CMI under a tripartition of system, which provides the second Rényi version of the Markov length. We introduce an efficient numerical scheme for the calculation of the second Rényi CMI based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism, and study the classification of non-trivial mixed states and the emergence of mixed state phase transitions for (i) the cluster model under odd-site local $Z$ decoherence and (ii) transverse field Ising model under both $ZZ$ and $X$ decoherence. The second Rényi CMI is a powerful measure to study non-trivial mixed ``gapped" quantum matters and mixed phase transitions. In addition to this, the present study shows that the second Rényi CMI exhibits specific behavior for the transition to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking mixed phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Adrian Agreda, Tong Wu, Franck Carcenac, Kevin Vynck, Philippe Lalanne</p>
            <p>Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include color shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies -- for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</p>

            <h2>Heterosynaptic Circuits Are Universal Gradient Machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang, Tomaso Poggio</p>
            <p>We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.</p>

            <h2>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan</p>
            <p>Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex decreases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</p>

            <p>In this work, we focus on the fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on bulk polycarbonate (PC) using 258 nm femtosecond laser pulses. A systematic approach was pursued to investigate the influence of various laser parameters such as fluence, effective number of pulses, energy dose and polarisation on the features of the generated LIPSS. Experimental results showed that linearly polarized beams produce LIPSS with period comparable to the laser wavelength. Moreover, it was observed that the orientation of LIPSS is either parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization, depending on the excitation level. These features are similar to the LIPSS formed on dielectrics, despite the considerably higher absorption and larger extinction coefficient (~10-2) of polycarbonate at 258 nm. The orientation and features of the patterns at different excitation levels are explained using Sipe's theory, while the excitation and induced carrier densities were quantified through the application of a theoretical physical model that describes ultrafast dynamics in polymers. Furthermore, observations revealed that low excitation levels with linearly polarized enhance the uniformity of LIPSS, whereas irradiating PC targets with circularly polarized beams leads to the formation of microscale topographies decorated with protruding nanosphered-like structures, with their size varying based on the laser conditions. A detailed analysis of the impact of the induced topographies on their wetting and optical properties demonstrated a steady increase in hydrophilicity over time, in contrast to a modest increase in optical absorbance. The results regarding the morphological features and properties of the induced topographies on PC are anticipated to support future efforts in creating patterned surfaces on polymeric materials for potential applications.</p>

            <p>Schrödinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.</p>

As the degree of non-reciprocity in interactions is varied, we can observe the emergence of a zoology of complex collective motion patterns that exhibit significantly different topologies and transport properties. Nematic closed filaments in the form of rings move as chiral active particles. Closed polar filaments with one singular topological point move ballistically, while those with two singular topological points rotate. Open polar filaments behave as persistent random walks. Furthermore, by changing the size of the field of view, we explore the metamorphic process that transforms one structure into another, finding that the process is non-reversible and presents strong hysteric effects. The analysis sheds light on the physics of single-species active particles with non-reciprocal interactions, providing evidence that topological and transport properties are closely related.</p>

            <p>The macroscopic phenomenon of filtration is the separation between suspended and liquid phases and it takes place in natural environments (e.g. groundwater, soil, hyporheic zone) and industrial systems (e.g. filtration plants, pharmaceutical industry, hospital care). Porous materials represent excellent filters since they are characterized by a large solid surface to which flowing particles can attach and be retained. Colloidal filtration by porous media is governed by a complex interplay between transport dynamics through intricate pore structures and surface-mediated retention. Yet, classical approaches fail to capture key properties (such as filter spatial heterogeneity) and experimental observations--e.g. non-exponential deposition profiles. A key limitation of such approaches lies in the assumption that particle attachment to solid surfaces occurs at a constant rate over a given length scale, neglecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the medium, i.e. pore size variability. Here, we develop a multiscale microfluidic model system to directly observe colloidal transport and deposition over more than three orders of magnitude in length--from tens of microns to a meter--within a porous architecture with controlled heterogeneity. By tracking individual colloidal particles within the pores, we reveal intermittent dynamics along each trajectory: particles alternate between long-range "flights" through pore channels and short-range localized "dives" near grain surfaces. During the dives, attachment can occur at a constant rate, but the distributed flight sizes, during which attachment cannot occur, produce anomalous filtration. This is quantified by deposition profiles and breakthrough curves. A stochastic model based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW), constrained by experimental data, captures this behavior and links pore structure with macroscopic filtration.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Gain-Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mário G. Silveirinha, Daigo Oue</p>
            <p>Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</p>

            <p>Superinductances are superconducting circuit elements that combine a large inductance with a low parasitic capacitance to ground, resulting in a characteristic impedance exceeding the resistance quantum $R_Q = h/(2e)^2 \simeq 6.45 \mathrm{k}\Omega$. In recent years, these components have become key enablers for emerging quantum circuit architectures. However, achieving high characteristic impedance while maintaining scalability and fabrication robustness remains a major challenge. In this work, we present two fabrication techniques for realizing superinductances based on vertically stacked Josephson junctions. Using a multi-angle Manhattan (MAM) process and a zero-angle (ZA) evaporation technique -- in which junction stacks are connected pairwise using airbridges -- we fabricate one-dimensional chains of stacks that act as high-impedance superconducting transmission lines. Two-tone microwave spectroscopy reveals the expected $\sqrt{n}$ scaling of the impedance with the number of junctions per stack. The chain fabricated using the ZA process, with nine junctions per stack, achieves a characteristic impedance of $\sim 16 \mathrm{k}\Omega$, a total inductance of $5.9 \mathrm{\mu H}$, and a maximum frequency-dependent impedance of $50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ at 1.4 GHz. Our results establish junction stacking as a scalable, robust, and flexible platform for next-generation quantum circuits requiring ultra-high impedance environments.</p>

Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis of the crystal: a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals have been theoretically predicted to become topological metals with anomalous Hall conductivity in amorphous systems. However, measuring the anomalous Hall conductivity in realistic materials, particularly those with multiple pairs of Weyl points, is a significant challenge. If a system respects time-reversal symmetry, then the anomalous Hall conductivity even vanishes. As such, it remains an open question how to probe the Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, under magnetic fields, a topological metal slab in amorphous systems exhibits three-dimensional quantum Hall effect, even in time-reversal invariant systems, thereby providing a feasible approach to exploring Weyl band like topology in amorphous materials. We unveil the topological origin of the quantized Hall conductance by calculating the Bott index. The index is carried by broadened Landau levels with bulk states spatially localized except at critical transition this http URL topological property also results in edge states localized at distinct hinges on two opposite surfaces.</p>

            <p>Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery [1-3]: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we reiterate that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are compatible with the generalized Maxwell's relations, which demonstrates the general robustness of the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze a set of simple-step scattering problems. When the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, a bound state inherently follows the second law of thermodynamics, while a scattering state may not. The root cause is associated with the nonlocal nature of the wave function. It implies that the non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy and localized wave packets, exhibiting a tendency to occur in "semiclassical" setups.</p>

            <h2>Non-linear photoconductivity of strongly driven graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Broers, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>We present the non-linear DC photoconductivity of graphene under strong infra-red (IR) radiation. The photoconductivity is obtained as the response to a strong DC electric field, with field strengths outside of the linear-response regime, while the IR radiation is described by a strong AC electric field. The conductivity displays two distinct regimes in which either the DC or the AC field dominates. We explore these regimes and associate them with the dynamics of driven Landau-Zener quenches in the case of a large DC field. In the limit of large AC field, we describe the conductivity in a Floquet picture and compare the results to the closely related Tien-Gordon effect. We present analytical calculations for the non-linear differential photoconductivity, for both regimes based on the corresponding mechanisms. As part of this discussion of the non-equilibrium state of graphene, we present analytical estimates of the conductivity of undriven graphene as a function of temperature and DC bias field strength that show very good agreement with our simulations.</p>

            <p>Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures by defining a topological index in both two-dimensional (2D) systems, such as thin films or curved surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism, both volume and surface topological numbers must be considered, requiring the identification of a proper global topological invariant to support categorization. Here we consider domain walls in cylindrical nanowires as an excellent playground for 3D nanomagnetic systems, excited by a charge current, that generates an OErsted field. We first provide experimental evidence of previously unreported domain-wall transformations of topology occurring at the nanosecond timescale. We investigate these transformations with micromagnetic simulations, tracking both bulk and surface topological this http URL demonstrate a topological invariant combining both signatures, while the topological charge varies from bulk to surface during the dynamics. The experimental change of topology is reproduced when the pulse duration matches the timescale of the internal transformations of the wall, and the current is switched off before the transformation is complete. We expect that the topological categorization and dynamical exploitation apply to any 3D nanomagnetic system.</p>

            <p>We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</p>

            <h2>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</h2>

            <p>We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E>E_0, while for E<E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</p>

            <p>We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene consecutively twisted at 1.49° and 1.68°. We demonstrate the atomic reconstruction between the two competing moiré superlattices strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moiré band insulator state, characterized by measured strong nonlocal valley Hall effect that sensitively depends on the inter-moiré competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-plane carrier distribution. Our study sheds light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted multilayer systems, by systematically investigating transport signatures of moiré Berry curvature and its enhancement from moiré-of-moiré lattice reconstruction. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach toward engineering the band structure and its topology for a quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</p>

            <p>The effect of spin-orbit coupling in a Josephson diode has not been elucidated due to its interplay with the complexity of Josephson devices. Here, we systematically control local electric fields in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions under in-plane magnetic fields and observe a polarity reversal of the Josephson diode. We interpret this polarity reversal as an effect of field-tunable spin-orbit coupling on nonreciprocal Josephson currents. A theoretical model, accounting for Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings in a planar Josephson junction containing many transverse subbands, aligns with the observed polarity reversal and its dependence on magnetic field. Our finding addresses spin-orbit control in a Josephson diode, enabling manipulation of Josephson harmonics.</p>

            <p>We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type, i.e., with an electron-electron interaction leading to the mean field description in a Cooper channel, via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including negative superfluid stiffness giving paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters. Negative superfluid stiffness indicates instability of this collective state.</p>

            <h2>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Harandi, Hooman Danesh, Kevin Linka, Stefanie Reese, Shahed Rezaei</p>
            <p>A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The introduced methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. SPiFOL, as a physics-informed operator learning method, enables rapid predictions through forward inference after training. To ensure accuracy, we incorporate physical constraints and diversify the training data. However, performance may still degrade for out-of-distribution microstructures. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. The framework shows great potential for efficient and scalable prediction of mechanical responses in complex material systems while also reducing the training time required for training physics-informed neural operators.</p>

            <p>(Scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) has significantly advanced materials science but faces challenges in correlating precise atomic structure information with the functional properties of devices due to its time-intensive nature. To address this, we introduce an analytical workflow for the holistic characterization, modelling, and simulation of device heterostructures. This workflow automates the experimental (S)TEM data analysis, providing an in-depth characterization of crystallographic information, 3D orientation, elemental composition, and strain distribution. It reduces a process that typically takes days for a trained human into an automatic routine solved in minutes. Utilizing a physics-guided artificial intelligence model, it generates representative descriptions of materials and samples. The workflow culminates in creating digital twins, 3D finite element and atomic models of millions of atoms, enabling simulations that provide crucial insights into device behaviour in practical applications. Demonstrated with SiGe planar heterostructures for scalable spin qubits, the workflow links digital twins to theoretical properties, revealing how atomic structure impacts materials and functional properties such as spatially-resolved phononic or electronic characteristics, or (inverse) spin orbit lengths. The versatility of our workflow is demonstrated through its application to a wide array of materials systems, device configurations, and sample morphologies.</p>

            <p>The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6Å to 27.2Å after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene.

            <h2>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saran Vijayan, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. By combining a continuum model for bent hollow beams with the definition of bending rigidity, we validate the model predictions against an analytical expression for the bending rigidity of large-diameter hBN nanotubes, expressed as a function of their radius and the in-plane Young modulus.</p>

            <p>Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses are mainstream in studies on the dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as in, e.g., organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground state ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt, for the phase transition, a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor that appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state that then evolves, while interacting with other degrees of freedom which are prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density, which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains that evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</p>

            <h2>Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong-Hao Wang, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.</p>

            <p>Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with superconductivity in intriguing ways. Here we propose that a conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated $p$-wave magnet exhibits behaviors analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity. The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong $p$-wave magnetism than usual ferromagnetism or $d$-wave altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in $p$-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic field $B_{c2}$; (iii) the supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a $p$-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new form of unconventional superconductivity generated by $p$-wave magnetism.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings provide a basis for the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</p>

            <p>Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</p>

            <h2>Non-ergodic Phase Transition in the Global Hysteresis of the Frustrated Magnet DyRu2Si2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Yoshimoto, Y. Tabata, T. Waki, H. Nakamura</p>
            <p>Some frustrated magnets exhibit a huge hysteresis called "global hysteresis (GH)", where the magnetic plateaus appearing in the increasing field process are skipped in the decreasing field process from the high magnetic field state. In this paper, we focused on the frustrated magnet DyRu2Si2 and measured magnetization relaxations from two plateau states inside the GH loop, the phases III and IV, and investigated the phase transitions into them. As a result of the relaxation measurements, no relaxation is observed in the phase III, whereas long-time relaxations of more than 105 sec are observed at the phase IV plateau. Moreover, a Mpemba-effect-like relaxation phenomenon where the relaxation from an initial state prepared in the zero-field-cooled condition overtakes that from an initial state prepared in the field-cooled condition is observed. These results indicate that the phase IV is the non-ergodic state with a complex free-energy landscape with multiple local minima, while the phase III has a simple free energy structure. Therefore, the III-IV phase transition is considered to be the ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition. Although this type of phase transition typically occurs in random glassy systems, the phase IV in DyRu2Si2 has a regular long-range ordered magnetic structure and yet exhibits non-ergodic properties, which is highly nontrivial. Our findings open the possibility of observing non-ergodic states in frustrated magnets with regular long-range orders.</p>

            <h2>X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. W. C. Dharma-wardana, Dennis. D. Klug (NRC-Canada)</p>
            <p>Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [Döppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 Å$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</p>

            <p>We discuss the locomotion of a thermally driven elastic two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control that is realized by the position-dependent friction coefficients. In our model, the two spheres are in equilibrium with independent heat baths having different temperatures, causing a heat flow between the two spheres. We generally show that the average velocity of the microswimmer is nonzero when the friction coefficients are position-dependent. Using the method of stochastic thermodynamics, we obtain the entropy production rate and discuss the efficiency of the two-sphere microswimmer. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism highlights the importance of information in active matter and can be a fundamental process in various biological systems.</p>

By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tigran V. Shahbazyan</p>
            <p>We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</p>

            <h2>Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.</p>

            <h2>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis S. Grebenkov, Ralf Metzler, Gleb Oshanin</p>
            <p>A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</p>

            <h2>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ji-Hui Pei, Christian Maes</p>
            <p>Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</p>

            <p>The van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet CrSBr has recently garnered significant attention due to its air stability, high magnetic transition temperature, and semiconducting properties. We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the Néel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.</p>

            <p>Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter, and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term, featuring complex second-nearest-neighbor hopping. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) nor (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moiré systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)<0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M<0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)>0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.</p>

            <p>The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The increase in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most deleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the piano key size and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence of noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</p>

            <p>In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena.

In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low-scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</p>

However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

            <p>Describing Li-ion battery cathodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal Ledge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson simulations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, we show that capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal 3d states. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.</p>

            <p>Complex dynamics when occurring autonomously, i.e. without external driving, is usually associated with everyday length scales and classical physics, e.g. living organisms. This dynamics is \emph{not} quantum coherent. Quantum coherent dynamics is, by contrast, assumed to be either simple periodic oscillation in particular when autonomous, e.g. spin precession, or random quantum fluctuations. Combining autonomous complex and quantum coherent dynamics on microscopic length-scales could allow for novel coherent quantum machines working without external time-dependent driving. Motivated by this, here we provide an exact theoretical condition for a system to display complex quantum coherent dynamics on both microscopic and macroscopic length scales that we call a \emph{dynamical quantum algebraic thread} (D-QAT). Due to D-QATs our autonomous quantum coherent dynamics is robust to realistic imperfections (including low-doped disorder) and present for generic initial states, allowing for potential realisations in experiments. We give an example of a \emph{spin lace} model structurally similar to magnetic azurite and certain recently experimentally realized large single-molecular magnets with long coherence times. Our work opens the possibility for many potential applications including ultra-dense storage and manipulation of quantum memories, creating \emph{giant} quantum coherent qubits, or microscopic quantum mechanism perform complicated motion.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation without dissipation: Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Robnik, Uroš Seljak</p>
            <p>Stochastic sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo are inspired by physical systems in a heat bath. Their equilibrium distribution is the canonical ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they must balance fluctuation and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In contrast to the common belief, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configuration space distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to be canonical. We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) as a dissipation-free system of stochastic differential equations (SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and show that the stationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble with the desired canonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC is ergodic for any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials, the expectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministic drift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationary distribution. This uncommon property is attractive for practical implementations as it implies that the drift-diffusion discretization schemes are bias-free, so the only source of bias is the discretization of the deterministic dynamics. We applied MCLMC on a lattice $\phi^4$ model, where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently the state-of-the-art integrator. For the same accuracy, MCLMC converges 12 times faster than HMC on an $8\times8$ lattice. On a $64\times64$ lattice, it is already 32 times faster. The trend is expected to persist to larger lattices, which are of particular interest, for example, in lattice quantum chromodynamics.</p>

            <p>Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.</p>

            <h2>Automatic Input Feature Relevance via Spectral Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Chicchi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Diego Febbe, Lorenzo Giambagli, Raffaele Marino, Duccio Fanelli</p>
            <p>In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</p>

            <h2>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended $XY$ model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor $XY$ model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Monte Carlo and Stabilizer States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhilahari Jeevanesan</p>
            <p>The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the Transverse-Field Ising model.</p>

            <p>We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ameya Chavda, Daniel Naegels, John Staunton</p>
            <p>We study the homogeneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry concomitantly with the spontaneous breaking of other internal and spacetime symmetries, including dilations. We use the symmetry-breaking pattern as the only input to derive, via the coset construction, general effective field theories for the symmetry-originated modes associated with Goldstone's theorem, namely the Nambu-Goldstone candidates. Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples. The derived general effective field theories also give rise to a broad class of theories exhibiting emergent enhanced shift symmetries, which constrain the mobility of the modes. The latter are referred to as fractonic modes.</p>

            <h2>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indranil Dey, Sridip Pal, Jiaxin Qiao</p>
            <p>We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$. The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality. In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha < 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aron Kerschbaumer, Marko Ljubotina, Maksym Serbyn, Jean-Yves Desaules</p>
            <p>Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.</p>

            <p>We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Bulgarelli, Elia Cellini, Alessandro Nada</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors $Q_\mathrm{int}$ significantly exceeding $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and Josephson parametric amplifiers in the single-photon regime by fitting the scattering data. We confirm the extracted $Q_\mathrm{int}$ values by analyzing purity of squeezed vacuum states generated by these devices. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Morandi, Sara Nicoletti, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani</p>
            <p>We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</p>

            <p>We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</p>

            <p>We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diptarka Das, Sumit R. Das, Arnab Kundu, Krishnendu Sengupta</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</p>

            <p>Stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.</p>

Here, we present bulk characterization and neutron scattering measurements of the SSL material Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$. We find that the Yb$^{3+}$ ions can be described by an effective spin-1/2 model at low temperatures and the system does not show signs of magnetic order down to 50 mK. The magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron spectroscopy data can be well-described by an isolated dimer model with highly anisotropic exchange that stabilizes a singlet ground state with the symmetric wavefunction up/up - down/down.

            <p>Point defects are of interest for many applications, from quantum sensing to modifying bulk properties of materials. Because of their localized orbitals, the electronic states are often strongly correlated, which has led to a proliferation of quantum embedding techniques to treat this correlation. In these techniques, a weakly correlated reference such as density functional theory is used to treat most of the one-particle states, while certain states are singled out as an active space to be treated with an effective interaction. We assess these techniques in the context of an iron defect in aluminum nitride by referencing to a fully correlated quantum Monte Carlo description. This comparison allows us to have access to detailed information about the many-body wave functions, which are not available experimentally. We find that errors in the underlying density functional theory calculation, and thus choice of the active space, lead to qualitatively incorrect excited states from the embedded model. These errors are extremely difficult to recover from by adding corrections such as double counting or many-body perturbation theory.</p>

Thus far, the choice of materials with exceptional excitonic response has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) configurations of vdW materials. At the same time, large interlayer distance and the possibility to create a variety of heterostructures offers an opportunity to control the dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and van der Waal 3D materials, thus engineering the excitonic properties. Here, we reveal that bulk vdW crystal CrCl3 answers this quest with a record exciton binding energy of 1.64 eV owing to a delicate interplay of quasi-2D electronic confinement and short-range magnetic correlations. Furthermore, we observe colossal binding energies in vdW crystals NbOCl2 (0.66 eV) and MoCl3 (0.35 eV) and formulate a universal exciton binding energy dependence on bandgap for 2D and 3D vdW materials. Hence, our findings establish a fundamental link between the layered structure of vdW materials and their excitonic properties.</p>

However, its van der Waals nature makes its thermal Hall response highly sensitive to structural disorder, leading to sample-dependent variations. Here, we investigate low-energy bulk excitations in the field-induced quantum disordered (FIQD) state of newly available ultraclean single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. High-resolution specific heat measurements under in-plane magnetic field rotation reveal an anisotropic excitation gap, whose field dependence is consistent with the Majorana gap in the KQSL state. Remarkably, when the field aligns with Ru-Ru bond directions, we observe gapless excitations with Dirac-like dispersions that quantitatively match theoretical predictions of Majorana bands based on the reported Kitaev interactions. Our findings in these ultraclean crystals provide strong evidence that the FIQD state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a robust KQSL, resilient against small disorder perturbations.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-selective proximity effect between chiral $p$-wave superconductors and quantum Hall insulators</h2>

            <p>Heterostructures of superconductors and quantum-Hall insulators are promising platforms of topological quantum computation. However, these two systems are incompatible in some aspects such as a strong magnetic field, the Meissner effect, and chirality. In this work, we address the condition that the superconducting proximity effect works in the bulk of quantum Hall states, and identify an essential role played by the vortex lattice regardless of pairing symmetry. We extend this finding to a heterostructure of a chiral $p$-wave superconductor in the mixed state and an integer quantum Hall insulator. The proximity effect works selectively in the lowest Landau level depending on relative chiralities. If the chiralities align, a topological phase transition to a topological superconductor occurs.</p>

            <h2>Raman spectroscopy of anyons in generic Kitaev spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aprem P. Joy, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>Optical probes have emerged as versatile tools for detecting exotic fractionalized phases in quantum materials. We calculate the low-energy Raman response arising from mobile, interacting Ising anyons (or visons) in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid perturbed by symmetry allowed interactions - a phase relevant to \rucl. under a magnetic field. At zero temperature, the two-anyon continuum response shows a leading power-law scaling of the intensity near the onset of the signal: $I(\omega) \sim (\omega-E^0_{2\sigma})^{\frac{1}{8}}$ for linear and parallel-circular polarization channels, where $E^0_{2\sigma}$ is the two-particle gap. Strong corrections due to short-range interactions arise at order $\frac{1}{4}$. For cross-circularly polarized channels, the scaling is given by $I(\omega) \sim (\omega-E^0_{2\sigma})^{|l\pm 1/8|}$, where the value of $l=0,1,2$ is determined by the number of minima in the single anyon dispersion. The exponents are directly related to the topological spin of Ising anyons $\theta_\sigma =\frac{\pi}{8}$, describing their exchange statistics. Our theory generalizes to spectral probes of anyonic quasiparticles with multiple band minima in other quantum liquids. Interaction between anyons may also induce bound-states, resulting in sharp peaks that show strong polarization dependence.</p>

            <p>We propose ferromagnetism that occurs in electrons at a saddle point with band touching, which we call the singular saddle point. At the singular saddle point, the divergent quantum metric induces ferromagnetic correlation, and the logarithmic divergence of the density of states ensures ferromagnetism within Stoner theory. This is a prototypical example of quantum geometric ferromagnetism. The two-dimensional $t_{2g}$-orbital model accommodates the ferromagnetism by this mechanism, which is continuously connected to the exactly proven flat-band ferromagnetism.</p>

            <p>Being resilient to magnetic field, Ising superconductor serves as an exceptional platform for studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. In this Letter, we first explore the transport properties of a two-terminal graphene-Ising superconductor junction where mirage gaps are induced in the superconductor by an exchange field due to magnetic proximity effect. We demonstrate that the chemical potential range of graphene supporting specular-Andreev reflection at the interface is between the two mirage gaps and about twice the Ising spin-orbit coupling strength. This enhances the resilience of observing specular-Andreev reflection against graphene potential fluctuations in experiments. We further study the Andreev interference effect based on a four-terminal junction of which two terminals consist of Ising superconductors in the presence of exchange fields. Due to the finite contribution from the spin-triplet pairing, the interference can be modulated by tuning the relative orientation of the exchange fields in addition to the traditional scheme by changing superconducting phase difference and the chemical potential of the normal region.</p>

            <p>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer an extremely rich material platform in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. The unconventional aspects include exotic coupling mechanisms such as the Ising pairing, a complex interplay with other electronic orders such as charge-density waves (CDWs), symmetry-breaking and topological effects, and non-trivial gap structures such as multi-gap and possible nodal phases. Among TMDs, titanium diselenide (1$T$-TiSe$_2$) is one of the most studied and debated cases. Hints to an anomalous structure of its superconducting order parameter have emerged over the years, possibly linked to its spatial texturing in real and reciprocal space due to the presence of a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phase, or to a pressure-driven multi-band Fermi surface. However, a direct evidence for a non-trivial structure of the superconducting gap in this material is still lacking. In this work, we bring the first evidence for a two-gap structure in the recently-discovered H-intercalated TiSe$_2$ superconductor (with T$_c \simeq 3.6$ K) by an extensive experimental study that combines magnetotransport measurements, point-contact spectroscopy and scanning tunnel spectroscopy. We show that the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (for $\vec B \parallel c$) as well as the shape of the point-contact and tunneling spectra strongly suggest the existence of two distinct superconducting gaps, and can indeed all be fitted in a self-consistent way with the same gap amplitudes $\Delta_1 = 0.26 \pm 0.12$ meV and $\Delta_2 =0.62 \pm 0.18$ meV.</p>

            <h2>Optical properties of a diamond NV color center from capped embedded multiconfigurational correlated wavefunction theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John Mark P. Martirez</p>
            <p>Diamond defects are among the most promising qubits. Modelling their properties through accurate quantum mechanical simulations can further their development into robust units of information. We use the recently developed capped density functional embedding theory (capped-DFET) with the multiconfigurational n-electron valence second-order perturbation theory to characterize the electronic excitation energies for different spin manifolds of the well-characterized negatively charged substitutional N defect adjacent to a vacancy (V$_C$) in diamond (N$_C$V$_C^-$). We successfully reproduce vertical excitation energies for both triplet and singlet states of N$_C$V$_C^-$ with errors < 0.1 eV. Unlike other embedding methods, capped-DFET exhibits robust predictions that are approximately independent of the embedded cluster size: it only requires a cluster to contain the defect atoms and their nearest neighbors (as small as a 40-atom capped cluster). Furthermore, our method is free from slowly converging Coulomb interactions between charged defects, and thus also only weakly dependent on supercell size.</p>

            <p>Motivated by a recent experiment reporting the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$, we investigate microscopically the prospects of realizing exotic topologically ordered states beyond conventional quantum Hall physics. We show that a non-Abelian spin Hall insulator, a state of two copies of the non-Abelian Moore-Read state, can be stabilized at half filling of time-reversal conjugate Chern bands. We elucidate that the existence of this phase relies on the reduction of opposite-spin interactions at short distances to overcome the Ising ferromagnetism. Moreover, we demonstrate that band mixing provides a generic mechanism for this reduction to be achieved. Quite remarkably, we find that a renormalization of opposite-spin interactions at short distances as small as 15 % of the moiré period is sufficient for a direct transition to a completely spin unpolarized phase which supports the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator. Furthermore, we show that the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator can either break time-reversal symmetry or preserve it depending on the underlying topological order.</p>

The diagonalized covariance matrix is then applied to Gaussian processes. This allows for a statistical mechanical analysis of Gaussian processes using the derived diagonalized matrix.

            <p>We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of great interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is (meta)stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-component magnon condensation. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.</p>

            <p>Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</p>

            <p>Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analog within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.</p>

            <p>Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Guo, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Metals at the brink of electronic quantum phase transitions display high-temperature superconductivity, competing orders, and unconventional charge transport, revealing strong departures from conventional Fermi liquid behavior. Investigation of these fascinating intertwined phenomena has been at the center of research across a variety of correlated materials over the past many decades. A ubiquitous experimental observation is the emergence of a universal timescale that governs electrical transport and momentum relaxation. In this work, we analyze an equally important theoretical question of how the energy contained in the electronic degrees of freedom near a quantum phase transition relaxes to the environment via their coupling to acoustic phonons. Assuming that the bottleneck for energy dissipation is controlled by the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons, we present a universal theory of the temperature dependence of the energy relaxation rate in a marginal Fermi liquid. We find that the energy relaxation rate exhibits a complex set of temperature-dependent crossovers controlled by emergent energy scales in the problem. We place these results in the context of recent measurements of the energy relaxation rate via non-linear optical spectroscopy in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Josephson diode effect in a superconducting interferometer under nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast to its thermodynamic counterpart, which requires the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, we demonstrate that a diode-like asymmetry of the critical current can emerge solely due to a dissipative current in the normal region of an otherwise symmetric Josephson junction. This effect is driven entirely by the nonequilibrium conditions, without the need for additional inversion symmetry breaking. Using the standard quasiclassical Keldysh Green's function formalism, we explicitly calculate the diode coefficient from the supercurrent-phase relation of the interferometer. Remarkably, within certain ranges of control parameters, such as applied voltage, temperature, and the geometric aspect ratio of the device, the diode coefficient can exceed its nominal perfect value.</p>

            <p>A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adham Alkady, Anatoly B. Kuklov</p>
            <p>Bose Einstein condensate of optically inactive (dark) intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of the point group and the time-reversal symmetries of a crystal. Accordingly, a number of the condensate components N$_v$ is determined by the symmetry. Since the valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, the minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the phase where individual valleys are not characterized by the condensate order, while the order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the N$_v$-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for N$_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. Upon further lowering temperature, a second transition transforms the paired phase into the N$_v$-component condensate.</p>

            <p>Controlling exciton relaxation and energy conversion pathways via their coupling to photonic modes is a central task in cavity-mediated quantum materials research. In this context, the light-matter hybridization in optical cavities can lead to intriguing effects, such as modified carrier transport, enhancement of optical quantum yield, and control of chemical reaction pathways. Here, we investigate the impact of the strong light-matter coupling regime on energy conversion, both in relaxation and upconversion schemes, by utilizing a strongly charged MoSe2 monolayer embedded in a spectrally tunable open-access cavity. We find that the charge carrier gas yields a significantly modified photoluminescence response of cavity exciton-polaritons, dominated by an intra-cavity like pump scheme. In addition, upconversion luminescence emerges from a population transfer from fermionic trions to bosonic exciton-polaritons. Due to the availability of multiple optical modes in the tunable open cavity, it seamlessly meets the cavity-enhanced double resonance condition required for an efficient upconversion. The latter can be actively tuned via the cavity length in-situ, displaying nonlinear scaling in intensity and fingerprints of the valley polarization. This suggests mechanisms that include both trion-trion Auger scattering and phonon absorption as its underlying microscopic origin.</p>

            <p>Femtosecond optical pulses have opened a new frontier in ultrafast dynamics, enabling direct access to fundamental interactions in quantum materials. In antiferromagnets (AFMs), where the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange interaction governs spin dynamics, this access is especially compelling, enabling the excitation of magnons - collective spin-wave modes - that naturally reach terahertz (THz) frequencies and supersonic velocities. Femtosecond optical pulses provided a route to coherently excite such magnons across the entire Brillouin zone. Controlling their spectral properties - such as the magnon gap and dispersion - represents the next monumental step, enabling dynamic tuning of group velocities, coherence, and interaction pathways. Yet, achieving this remains a challenge, requiring ultrafast and long-lasting manipulation of the underlying exchange interaction. Here, we show that in DyFeO3 - an insulating AFM with strongly coupled electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom - resonant above-bandgap optical excitation leads to a dramatic renormalization of the THz magnon spectrum, including a near-total collapse of the magnon gap. Our analysis reveals this transformation to be consistent with a transient reduction of the exchange interaction by nearly 90% in the near-surface nanoscale region. These findings establish a pathway for light-driven, nanoscale control of AFM spin dynamics, opening opportunities for reconfigurable, high-speed magnonic and spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Rosenberg, D. Nicoletti, M. Buzzi, A. Iudica, Y. Liu, B. Keimer, A. Cavalleri</p>
            <p>Resonant optical excitation of apical-oxygen phonon modes in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ has been shown to induce superconducting-like optical properties at temperatures far higher than the equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into an inductive response, reminiscent of a superconducting state, an assignement that was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties. These experiements have so far been challenging because of the high in-plane equilibrium reflectivity, from which small changes in the optical response determine the transient conductivity. We observe a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, also consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Planckian scattering and parallel conduction channels in the iron chalcogenide superconductors FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ralph Romero III, Hee Taek Yi, Seongshik Oh, N. P. Armitage</p>
            <p>The remarkable linear in temperature resistivity of the cuprate superconductors, which extends in some samples from $T_c$ to the melting temperature, remains unexplained. Although seemingly simple, this temperature dependence is incompatible with the conventional theory of metals that dictates that the scattering rate, $1/\tau$, should be quadratic in temperature if electron-electron scattering dominates. Understanding the origin of this temperature dependence and its connection to superconductivity may provide the key to pick the lock of high-temperature superconductivity. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) we elucidate the low temperature conducting behavior of two FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (FTS) samples, one with almost equal amounts of Se and Te that is believed to be a topological superconductor, and one that is more overdoped. Constrained with DC resistivity, we find two conduction channels that add in parallel, a broad one in frequency with weak temperature dependence and a sharper one whose scattering rate goes as the Planckian limited rate, $\sim kT/h$. Through analysis of its spectral weight we show the superconducting condensate is mainly drawn from the channel that undergoes this Planckian scattering.</p>

            <p>Entanglement has been widely investigated in condensed matter systems since they are considered good candidates for developing quantum technologies. Additionally, entanglement is a powerful tool to explore quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems, with the von Neumann entropy being considered a proper measure of quantum entanglement for pure bipartite systems. For lattice systems, in particular, the single-site entanglement quantifies how much information about the quantum state of the remaining sites can be obtained by a measurement at a single site. Here, we use Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to obtain the average single-site entanglement for the two-dimensional Hubbard model in different geometries, probing the effects of varying temperature and interaction strength. We find that the average single-site entanglement signals the quantum phase transitions in such systems, allowing us to identify and characterize signatures of quantum phase transitions even at finite temperatures. We also analyze the relation between entanglement and magnetic susceptibility: in all the geometries considered, we find regimes in which the quantities are linearly connected. Our findings could then guide experiments to estimate entanglement via the susceptibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Blommel, Jason Kaye, Yuta Murakami, Emanuel Gull, Denis Golež</p>
            <p>Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</p>

In particular, magnetic-field-free SDEs have been extensively investigated because of their potential to serve as building blocks for superconducting circuit technology. In this letter, we report the field-free SDE in a layered superconductor, FeSe. Its underlying physics is clarified by systematic controlled experiments to be an interplay of a large thermoelectric response and geometrical asymmetry in FeSe.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuuki Ogawa, Satoru Hayami</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the generation of net magnetization induced by static strain in $g$-wave altermagnets, which exhibit the symmetric spin-split band structure under collinear spin textures free from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling. By analyzing a tight-binding model in a two-dimensional tetragonal system, we show that the $g$-wave altermagnets give rise to the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect, where a net magnetization is induced by the second-order strain. We compare the results for the $g$-wave altermagnets with those for the $d$-wave altermagnets, where the linear piezomagnetic effect occurs. As a result, we find that the induced magnetization is enhanced when the Fermi level lies on the band with the large spin splitting in both cases. We also show that the magnitudes of the induced magnetization are comparable to each other. Our results indicate that the nonlinear piezomagnetic effect is a good phenomenon to characterize the physical properties in $g$-wave altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Bishnu Karki, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Néel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen</p>
            <p>The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site Néel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site Néel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</p>
            <p>The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</p>

            <p>Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</p>

            <p>We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</p>

            <p>Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electron-volt (eV) scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications. A variety of such magnetic states with nontrivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d, g, or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets. Achieving voltage-based control of the nonuniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energyefficient and compact devices for information storage and processing. Spin-spiral type-II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principle calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type-II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent the first direct observation of unconventional odd-parity magnetism in a spin-spiral type-II multiferroic, and open a new frontier of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.</p>

            <p>Composite multiferroics consisting of a ferroelectric material interfaced with a ferromagnetic material can function above room temperature and exhibit improved magnetoelectric (ME) coupling compared to single-phase multiferroic materials, making them desirable for applications in energy efficient electronic devices. In this study, we demonstrate electrical side-gate control of magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in single-crystalline ferromagnetic Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ thin films grown on ferroelectric PMN-PT (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ is selected due to its large magnetoelastic coupling and low magnetic damping. We find that the magnetoresistance curves of patterned Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ films are controlled by voltages applied to electrostatic side gates. Angle-dependent magnetoresistance scans reveal that the origin of this effect is strain-mediated variation of the magnetic anisotropy due to piezoelectric effects in the PMN-PT. This electrical control of magnetic properties could serve as a building block for future magnetoelectronic and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides insights into the nonlinear response of correlated lattice systems. We simulate multipulse excitations in the Hubbard model using nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to extract the 2DCS signal of weak-coupling antiferromagnets with and without disorder. By comparing calculations with static and dynamic Hartree terms, and analyzing the waiting-time dependence of the signal, we identify the contribution of the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode to the spectroscopic features and the relevant underlying processes. With broadband pulses, the rephasing and nonrephasing peaks at the gap energy are found to be of predominant Higgs character, while the two-quantum signals originate from single-particle excitations. Using narrow-band pulses, we also demonstrate a strong enhancement of these Higgs-related signals at a pulse frequency of half the gap size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Ōiké, Robert Peters, Koki Shinada</p>
            <p>The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has drawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles. Despite the advances in research, a fundamental understanding of multipole moments, particularly octupole moments, remains limited due to the challenges of accurately treating the position operator in bulk crystals, which is integral to their definitions. In this paper, we overcome this problem by using a thermodynamic relation and derive a formula of the spin magnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies Středa formulas, which relate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM. One particularly important property is that the SMOM of $d$-wave altermagnets is dominated by nonrelativistic SMOMs regardless of spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, these nonrelativistic SMOMs exhibit a Néel order dependence that is predicted by the Landau theory of $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].</p>

Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as the order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric antiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred to as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic octupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a gauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals based on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Our expression reveals a contribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry as conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net magnetization. We demonstrate that such an anisotropic magnetic dipole acts as an order parameter for antiferromagnets that exhibit the anomalous Hall effect.</p>

Here we report the emergence of surface spin-wave excitations within the bulk magnon band gap of type-A van der Waals antiferromagnets composed of antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic monolayers. In contrast to the magnetostatic Damon-Eshbach modes in magnetic slabs, these surface waves are pure exchange modes owing to the reduced interlayer exchange coupling at surface layers, and thus persist in ultrathin multilayer stacks and at large wave numbers. We show that they can be efficiently excited by electromagnetic waves, with absorption power comparable to or even exceeding that of bulk modes. Moreover, their magnetic stray fields exhibit pronounced even-odd oscillations with the number of monolayers that should be observable by NV-center magnetometry.</p>

Both single layer and bilayer situations are considered. The calculations show that the existence and related topologies of these edge states are well captured by a class of non-Hermitian single or coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains models H(ky) parameterized by momentum ky, where the edge states can appear as the ground state for some cases. Interestingly, although the eigenproblem of bosonic BdG models is equivalent to the one of non-Hermitian systems, the conventional bulkedge correspondence for Hermitian systems is partially valid. The influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next nearest-neighbor spins are also discussed, which break the time-reversal symmetry and lead to a straight connection between edge states for magnonic systems and non-zero Chern number of non-Hermitian bulk two-dimensional systems.</p>

While the lowest two bands correspond to spin-$1/2$ fermions, the fermions in the highest band are of spin-$3/2$. Because the bands are for different species of fermions, the particle-hole excitation channel across the bands is closed. However, fractionalized excitations as spin-$1/2$ and spin-$3/2$ fermions in pairs open a cooperon channel of excitations in Raman scattering. The background spectral intensity profile obtained by Raman scattering measurements in Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_4$O$_{12}$ having a trimer chain consisting of spin-$1/2$ Cu ions, has comprehensively been shown to be consistent with these excitations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste de Vaulx, Quintin N. Meier, Pierre Toulemonde, Andrés Cano, Valerio Olevano</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions</h2>

            <p>Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient strength (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</p>

            <h2>Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bishnu Karki, Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Attaining superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) beyond the limit around 14 K observed thus far in spinel compounds AB2X4 (A, B = transition metals, X = O/chalcogen) could elucidate interaction intricacies and inform materials design. This work spotlights CuIr2S4, which exhibits a distinct metal-insulator transition below 230 K, as an unconventional candidate for activation under high pressure. Through transport, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments conducted at pressures up to 224 GPa, we unveil pressure-tuning that suppressed CuIr2S4's transition, yielding two superconducting phases with an un-precedented Tc for spinels. Initially, 3.8 K onset rose monotonically, reaching 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Unexpectedly, a distinct phase with Tc = 2.2 K distinctly emerged at higher pressures, intimating unconventional couplings. Our findings suggest that both geometric frustration and electron-electron interactions play crucial roles in the superconductivity observed in CuIr2S4. The findings stretch perceived temperature limits in spinels and provide structure-property insights to guide the optimiza-tion of quantum materials interactions for tailored targeted functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal Shavit, Jason Alicea</p>
            <p>Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.</p>

            <h2>Exact joint distributions of three global characteristic times for Brownian motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We consider three global characteristic times for a one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(\tau)$ in the interval $\tau\in [0,t]$: the occupation time $t_{\rm o}$ denoting the cumulative time where $x(\tau)>0$, the time $t_{\rm m}$ at which the process achieves its global maximum in $[0,t]$ and the last-passage time $t_l$ through the origin before $t$. All three random variables have the same marginal distribution given by Lévy's arcsine law. We compute exactly the pairwise joint distributions of these three times and show that they are quite different from each other. The joint distributions display rather rich and nontrivial correlations between these times. Our analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Square skyrmion lattice in multiorbital $f$-electron systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Zha, Satoru Hayami</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.</p>

            <p>We present a tunable plasmonic platform that allows room temperature hybridization of dissimilar excitons, namely of Wannier-Mott excitons in monolayer (1L) WS2 and Frenkel excitons in molecular J-aggregates via simultaneous strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons. It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature $T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below $T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.</p>

            <h2>Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ned Thaddeus Taylor, Michael Thomas Morgan, Steven Paul Hepplestone</p>
            <p>This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics of nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in determining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the behaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these perovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and results are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results from these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites - the undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2 surface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by the phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO surface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies at the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich conditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2 surface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form, the BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more suitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the understanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which will aid in surface growth and manufacturing.</p>

            <p>The link between composition, microstructure and mechanics of NASH and KASH gels is elusive, even in pure metakaolin-based geopolymers. This article exploits molecular mechanics, coarse-grained nanomechanics and micromechanics, to interpret new experimental results from microscopy, porosimetry and nanoindentation. KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs 30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal density (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and hardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs 0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed through predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of NASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for new, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting simulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than equally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic moduli.</p>

            <p>The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</p>

            <p>Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking. This time crystal phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced time crystal is closer to the idea of crystal, compared to other time crystal realizations.</p>

            <p>We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</p>

            <p>Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle Monkman, Mona Berciu</p>
            <p>While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described accurately by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this also extends to other coupling strengths. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths to gauge the validity of the Lindblad dynamics during a finite time evolution, and show that for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics generally only holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also prove that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donggang Cao, Gilad Yossifon</p>
            <p>Active (self-propelling) particles have emerged as innovative microscale tools in the field of single cell analysis with the advantages of being untethered, remotely controlled, hybrid powered, with sub-cellular precision. This study investigates the dielectrophoretic (DEP) response and electro-mechanical deformation of cell nuclei interacting with active metallo-dielectric Janus Particles (JPs) under an externally applied electric field. An equivalent droplet two-phase model is employed to simulate the bioparticle, coupling the Navier-Stokes equations with the Phase Field Model to capture fluid motion and interface dynamics. Good qualitative agreement is obtained among experimental, analytical, and numerical results. The findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between nucleus deformation and its surface coverage of the JP with respect to the applied voltage. The overall coverage ratio of the JP dielectric hemisphere increases with voltage as the positive DEP force on the dielectric side strengthens, exhibiting maximum at a certain voltage. The strong correlation between nucleus flexibility and JP surface coverage suggests that the JP coverage ratio could serve as a biomechanical marker for nucleus deformability, providing a novel method for in-situ evaluation of nucleus mechanics.</p>

We construct a parton-inspired trial wavefunction ansatz for the ground states that has remarkably high overlap with exact diagonalization in both phases and throughout the phase transition. Our ansatz is stable to adding some bosonic interactions beyond the on-site hard core constraint. We confirm that the transition is well described by a projective translation symmetry-protected multiple parton band gap closure, as has been previously predicted. However, unlike prior work, we find that our wavefunctions require anomalous (BCS-like) parton correlations to describe the phase transition and SF phase accurately.</p>

            <p>We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of ``double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</p>

In these systems, the chiral spin texture which lacks inversion symmetry can imprint itself upon the electronic structure through Hund's coupling, leading to novel low-frequency optical activity. Using perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of both relativistic and non-relativistic models of conduction electrons coupled to spin textures, we analyze how the GME manifests in both single-$q$ and multi-$q$ textures. Analytical expressions for the rotatory power are derived in terms of universal scaling functions. Estimates based on realistic material parameters reveal an experimentally viable range of values for the rotatory power. The GME arises from the orbital and spin magnetic moments of conduction electrons, with the orbital part closely tied to Berry curvature and playing a significant role in relativistic metals but not so in non-relativistic metals where there is no inherent Berry curvature. The spin contribution to the GME can be significant in non-relativistic metals with a large Fermi energy. Our work establishes the GME as a sensitive probe of magnetic chirality and symmetry breaking in metallic chiral magnets.</p>

            <p>Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.</p>

            <p>Unconventional superconductors have specific signatures in their magnetic properties, such as intrinsic magnetization at interfaces and around defects and fractional and multiquanta vortices, with much attention focused on heavy fermion and high-T_c superconductors. Here we report an observation of highly anomalous magnetization in a candidate topological superconductor beta-PdBi2, a layered material where hidden inversion symmetry breaking leads to spin polarization and spin-momentum locking of the electronic bands. We observe strictly linear, non-hysteretic dc magnetization, a transition to sharply reduced ac susceptibility vs the magnetic field H applied parallel to the ab plane, and a strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane H. Based on our earlier finding of a magnetic-field induced phase transition from s-wave to nodal p-wave superconductivity in the tunnelling spectra of PdBi2, we propose that this unusual behavior can be explained by a transition from a conventional vortex structure in low-H s-wave phase to a domain structure corresponding to spatial phase separation into superconducting (nodal p-wave) and normal domains, identifying new features of magnetization that can arise from the multiplicity of superconducting phases.</p>

            <p>Routine investigations of plasmonic phenomena at the quantum level present a formidable computational challenge due to the large system sizes and ultrafast timescales involved. This Feature Article highlights the use of density functional tight-binding (DFTB), particularly its real-time time-dependent formulation (RT-TDDFTB), as a tractable approach to study plasmonic nanostructures from a purely quantum mechanical purview. We begin by outlining the theoretical framework and limitations of DFTB, emphasizing its efficiency in modeling systems with thousands of atoms over picosecond timescales. Applications of RT-TDDFTB are then explored in the context of optical absorption, nonlinear harmonic generation, and plasmon-mediated photocatalysis. We demonstrate how DFTB can reconcile classical and quantum descriptions of plasmonic behavior, capturing key phenomena such as size-dependent plasmon shifts and plasmon coupling in nanoparticle assemblies. Finally, we showcase DFTB's ability to model hot carrier generation and reaction dynamics in plasmon-driven \ch{H2} dissociation, underscoring its potential to model photocatalytic processes. Collectively, these studies establish DFTB as a powerful, yet computationally efficient tool to probe the emergent physics of materials at the limits of space and time.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Broken Inversion Symmetry on Molecular States in multi-Weyl fermions</h2>

            <p>We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -yet never crossing- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. M. Tonin, T. Pauletti, R. M. Dos Santos, V. V. França</p>
            <p>The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic method used for optimization problems. Although not a machine learning method per se, ACO is often employed alongside machine learning models to enhance performance through optimization. We adapt an ACO algorithm to optimize the so-called FVC density functional for the ground-state energy of strongly correlated systems. We find the parameter configurations that maximize optimization efficiency, while reducing the mean relative error ($MRE$) of the ACO functional. We then analyze the algorithm's performance across different dimensionalities ($1D-5D$), which are related to the number of parameters to be optimized within the FVC functional. Our results indicate that $15$ ants with a pheromone evaporation rate superior to $0.2$ are sufficient to minimize the $MRE$ for a vast regime of parameters of the strongly-correlated system -- interaction, particle density and spin magnetization. While the optimizations $1D$, $2D$, and $4D$ yield $1.5\%< MRE< 2.7\%$, the $3D$ and $5D$ optimizations lower the $MRE$ to $\sim0.8\%$, reflecting a $67\%$ error reduction compared to the original FVC functional ($MRE = 2.4\%$). As simulation time grows almost linearly with dimension, our results highlight the potential of ant colony algorithms for density-functional problems, combining effectiveness with low computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Exchange Induced Spillover on Poor Man's Majoranas in Minimal Kitaev Chains</h2>

            <p>The "Poor Man's Majoranas" (PMMs) [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection can "spill over" from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin $S$. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling $J$, solely the half $2S+1$ $(2S+2)$ of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) $S.$ Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity $2S+1$ holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by $J$ becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.</p>

            <h2>Quantized resonant tunneling effect in Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Meng, Xiuqiang Wu, Jiansheng Wu</p>
            <p>We study the Josephson effect in SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnets (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the Josephson critical current displays periodic resonance peaks as exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, provided a potential barrier exists at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface. These resonance peaks emerge under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)}d_{1(2)}=\left(n_{1(2)}+1/2\right)\pi$. Here, $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ represents a center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. This critical current feature arises from a resonant tunneling effect induced by spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis. At resonance, the Josephson current primarily originates from the first harmonic in both parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations, whereas the second harmonic becomes more significant in perpendicular configurations. In cases where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while maintaining it in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</p>

            <p>We investigate emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy, superconducting diode effect) at the heterointerface of two non-superconducting van der Waals (vdW) materials, the Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_2$ and the antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide FeTe, grown using molecular beam epitaxy. We show from electrical transport measurements that two dimensional (2D) superconductivity arises at the heterointerface below temperature $T \sim 12$~K. When capped with a 2D ferromagnet (CrTe$_2$), these heterostructures show a superconducting diode effect with efficiency of about 30\%. With strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe$_2$, these epitaxial heterostructures provide an attractive epitaxial vdW platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity in Dirac semimetals and for developing non-reciprocal devices for superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic theoretical study on the structural and electronic properties of twisted trilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$, where two independent moiré patterns form between adjacent layers. Using a continuum approach, we investigate the optimized lattice structure and the resulting energy band structure, revealing fundamentally different electronic behaviors between helical and alternating twist configurations. In helical trilayers, lattice relaxation induces $\alpha\beta$ and $\beta\alpha$ domains, where the two moiré patterns shift to minimize overlap, while in alternating trilayers, $\alpha\alpha'$ domains emerge with aligned moiré patterns. A key feature of trilayer TMDs is the summation of moiré potentials from the top and bottom layers onto the middle layer, effectively doubling the potential depth. In helical trilayers, this mechanism generates a Kagome lattice potential in the $\alpha\beta$ domains, giving rise to flat bands characteristic of Kagome physics. In alternating trilayers, the enhanced potential confinement forms deep triangular quantum wells, distinct from those found in bilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moderate perpendicular electric field can switch the layer polarization near the valence band edge, providing an additional degree of tunability. In particular, it enables tuning of the hybridization between orbitals on different layers, allowing for the engineering of diverse and controllable electronic band structures. Our findings highlight the unique role of moiré potential summation in trilayer systems, offering a broader platform for designing moiré-based electronic and excitonic phenomena beyond those achievable in bilayer TMDs.</p>

            <h2>Exact multiple complex mobility edges and quantum state engineering in coupled 1D quasicystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Wang, Zhenbo Wang, Jiaqi Liu, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>The key concept of mobility edge, which marks the critical transition between extended and localized states in energy domain, has attracted significant interest in the cutting-edge frontiers of modern physics due to its profound implications for understanding localization and transport properties in disordered systems. However, a generic way to construct multiple mobility edges (MME) is still ambiguous and lacking. In this work, we propose a brief scheme to engineer both real and complex exact multiple mobility edges exploiting a few coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains. We study the extended-localized transitions of coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains along the chain direction. The model combines both the well-established quasiperiodicity and a kind of freshly introduced staggered non-reciprocity, which are aligned in two mutually perpendicular directions, within a unified framework. Based on analytical analysis, we predict that when the couplings between quasiperiodic chains are weak, the system will be in a mixed phase in which the localized states and extended states coexist and intertwine, thus lacking explicit energy separations. However, as the inter-chain couplings increase to certain strength, exact multiple mobility edges emerge. This prediction is clearly verified by concrete numerical calculations of the Fractal Dimension and the scaling index $\beta$. Moreover, we show that the combination of quasiperiodicity and the staggered non-reciprocity can be utilized to design and realize quantum states of various configurations. Our results reveal a brief and general scheme to implement exact multiple mobility edges for synthetic materials engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.</p>

            <p>With his huge entropy change and a strong interplay between magnetic order, structural and electrical properties, the first-order antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition is a paradigmatic example of the multicaloric effect. The unraveling of the physics underlying the phase transition needs a better understanding of the thermal hysteresis of FeRh within the AF-FM phase coexistence region. In this work, we compare the effect of two very different types of thermal cycling on the hysteresis of the magnetic order: quasi-static heating, and cooling of the entire 195 nm thick film, and a f =100 kHz modulated heating driven by a laser focused down to a spot of about ten micron squared at the film surface. Taking advantage of the reflectivity difference between both phases to probe optically their respective fraction, we show that whereas only temperature-driven reflectivity variations (dR/dT , thermoreflectance) are detected in the pure phases, a huge modulation of the phase-dependent reflectance at the driving frequency f is detected in the phase coexistence temperature range. This is quantitatively described as resulting from a substantial modulation of the FM fraction (up to 90%) with increasing laser power. A simplified rate-independent hysteresis model with return-point-memory (RPM), represented in terms of bistable units that undergo a temperature excursion corresponding to a given laser power, reproduces very well the optically measured FM phase modulation characteristics for a broad range of temperature excursions. This offers an insight into the leading role of quenched disorder in defining thermal hysteresis in FeRh under high excitation frequency, when the material is periodically driven out-of-equilibrium.</p>

            <p>V$_6$O$_{13}$ exhibits the metal-insulator transition (MIT) with vanadium-vanadium (V-V) dimer formation. The magnetostriction of V$_6$O$_{13}$ along the crystallographic $b$-axis has been measured in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 186 T at several temperatures in this work. The large negative magnetostriction as large as $\Delta L / L \sim10^{-3}$ was observed above 110 T below the transition temperature. Discussion based on experimental results and the physical property of V$_6$O$_{13}$ suggests that the observed large negative magnetostriction corresponds to the collapse of V-V dimer molecular orbital (MO). This is the first case for direct observation of lattice change originating from the magnetic field-induced collapse of V-V dimer MO in vanadium oxides. In addition, the $B$-$T$ phase diagram and the magnitude of magnetostriction indicate that the collapse of V-V dimer MO probably accompanies the insulator-to-metal transition. A large hysteresis that is larger than 50 T was observed, which probably arises from the non-equilibrated cross-correlation of such degrees of freedom as the charge, spin, and lattice. Comparison with the VO$_2$ case suggests the magnetic entropy of the remanent paramagnetic spins in the insulating phase may play an important role for the MIT in V$_6$O$_{13}$.</p>

            <p>Guided by experiments contrasting electrically accelerated recovery with natural healing, this study formulates a model to investigate the importance of electroactive differential growth and morphological changes in tissue repair. It underscores the clinical potential of leveraging electroactive differential growth for improved healing outcomes. The study reveals that voltage stimulation significantly enhances the healing and growth of biological tissues, accelerating the regeneration process across various growth modalities and steering towards isotropic growth conditions that do not favor any specific growth pathways. Enhancing the electroelastic coupling parameters improves the efficacy of bioelectric devices, initiating contraction and fortification of biological tissues in alignment with the electric field. This process facilitates swift cell migration and proliferation, as well as oriented growth of tissue. In instances of strain stiffening at elevated strains, the extreme critical growth ratio aligns with the predictions of neo-Hookean models. Conversely, for tissues experiencing strain stiffening under moderate to very low strain conditions, the strain stiffening effect substantially delays the onset of electroelastic growth instability, ultimately producing a smooth, hyperelastic surface devoid of any unstable morphologies. Our investigation, grounded in nonlinear electroelastic field and perturbation theories, explores how electric fields influence differential growth and instability in biological tissues. We examine the interactions among dimensionless voltage, internal pressure, electroelastic coupling, radius ratio, and strain stiffening, revealing their effects on promoting growth and delaying instability. This framework offers insights into the mechanisms behind electroactive growth and its instabilities, contributing valuable knowledge to the tissue healing.</p>

This study explores the two-dimensional, 18-crown-6-like N8 structure (2D-N8) as a promising electrode material for next-generation rechargeable post-lithium batteries. We thoroughly investigated the pristine N8 structures, focusing on their stability and performance metrics. Our analysis revealed remarkable structural stability across the board. Additionally, electronic calculations indicated a small band gap of 0.54 eV for the N8 monolayer, suggesting favorable electronic properties for battery applications. When we evaluated a series of metal ions as adsorbates, we found that the pristine N8 monolayer achieved an impressive storage capacity of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) ions, highlighting its potential for effective ion storage. Our findings suggest that the engineered 2D-N8 structure offers a unique combination of stability and electrochemical performance that could significantly contribute to developing efficient and durable energy storage technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Grober, Tanumoy Dhar, David Saintillan, Jérémie Palacci</p>
            <p>Motile bacteria are a wonder of nature's engineering: microscopic engines that transduce biochemical energy into the work they require to explore their environment. This added energy turns the surrounding fluid into a bath that departs from an equilibrium one. Bacterial baths agitate suspended spheres more vividly than thermal fluctuations and can power microscopic ratchets. A salient requirement to extract work from bacterial baths was the asymmetric shape of the ratchets, designed to rectify the interactions with bacteria. In contrast with past results, here we show that swimming E. coli power the persistent rotation of discs, in absence of asymmetry. Combining state-of-the art nanoprinting, quantitative measurements of the dynamics of individual bacteria, and hydrodynamic modeling, we elucidate the mechanism and show that the counter-rotation of the flagella and the bacterium body lead to a torque dipole and traction onto the disc, and subsequent rotation. Remarkably, the mechanism is independent of the direction or orientation of navigation of bacteria under the disc, hence additive and contactless. Resulting from the interplay of the torque dipole of flagellated bacteria with simple geometric confinement, this hydrodynamic mechanism bridges scales, leveraging the chirality of bacteria nanomotors towards the manipulation of objects at least ten thousand times larger. The study lays the groundwork for novel bio-hybrid micromachines that harness living microorganisms for controlled motion at the microscale. Our findings provide further fundamental insights into bacterial hydrodynamics and open avenues for the development of autonomous, self-powered microdiscs for the study of chiral fluids.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneous Diffusion in Confined Colloidal Suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerhard Jung, Alejandro Villada-Balbuena, Thomas Franosch</p>
            <p>We have performed confocal microscopy experiments and computer simulations of colloidal suspensions with moderate volume fraction confined between two quasi-parallel, rough walls [A. Villada-Balbuena et al., Soft Matter, 2022, 18, 4699-4714]. Here we investigate many facets of the dynamical properties of the system, such as confined and inhomogeneous diffusion, mean first-passage times and generalized incoherent scattering functions. We observe that the experiment features strong footprints of the confinement in the dynamical properties, such as inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients and non-zero off-diagonal elements in the incoherent scattering function which we can quantitatively model and analyze with computer simulations. This allows us, for example, to systematically investigate the impact of surface roughness. Our comparative study therefore advances the fundamental understanding of the impact of confinement on dynamics in fluids and colloidal suspensions.</p>

            <h2>Microcanonical ensemble out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Belousov, Jenna Elliott, Florian Berger, Lamberto Rondoni, Anna Erzberger</p>
            <p>Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems in and out of equilibrium. While the latter generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories--all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed macro- and microscopic constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations underlying the theories of random walks and stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our theory highlights differences between nonequilibrium regimes not evident in the traditional formulation of the maximum-caliber principle. We validate our results by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics, which are critical for investigating systems where the conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.</p>

            <h2>Inhomogeneous Phase Stiffness in $2$D $s$-wave Disordered Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Biswas, A. Taraphder, Sudhansu S. Mandal</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of white-noise disorder on the local phase stiffness and thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor. Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral formalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting order parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant manner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to derive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems. Solving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we calculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder strengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength, which becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder strength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed throughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$ increases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may indicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence of a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures.</p>

            <p>Extracting the Hamiltonian of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in correlated quantum matter. Here we put forward a machine learning strategy to extract the spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows to directly extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the different exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that can be used to predict the Hamiltonian of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable learning a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption analysis through an integrated workflow for isotherm fitting, heat of adsorption estimation, mixture prediction, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM's intuitive GUI requires no coding and supports a broad isotherm library (e.g., Langmuir, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov, Structural-Transition-Adsorption). It also enables non-isothermal breakthrough simulations with axial dispersion. Case studies, such as Xe/Kr breakthrough curves in SBMOF-1, closely match the results from other software applications, such as RUPTURA. Mixture predictions can be done using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) and Extended Langmuir models, while isosteric heats are derived from Clausius-Clapeyron or Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Goremykin, A. A. Katanin</p>
            <p>We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksey Alekseev, Agnieszka Cichy, Konrad Jerzy Kapcia</p>
            <p>Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</p>

            <p>We compute the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined on a curved surface and unravel the effects of curvatures. Starting with a general formulation for any smooth surface, we apply it to a prolate ellipsoid, which is inspired by recent bubble trap experiments. Using a perturbative approach to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and a general Ansatz, followed by a dimensional reduction, we derive an effective two-dimensional equation that includes a curvature-dependent geometric potential. We compute the ground state using Thomas-Fermi approximation and, for an isotropic confinement, we find that the highest accumulation of atoms happens on the regions with the greatest difference between the principal curvatures. For a prolate ellipsoid, this accumulation happens on the equator, which is contrary to previous findings that describe accumulation on the poles of a bubble trap. Finally, we explain the reasons for this difference: the higher accumulation of atoms on the poles happens due to anisotropies in the confinement, while the higher accumulation on the equator happens exclusively due to the geometric properties of the surface.</p>

            <p>Thanks to their excellent properties of low cost, lightweight, portability, and conformity, flexible perovskite-based tandem solar cells show great potentials for energy harvesting applications, with flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem solar cells particularly promising for achieving high efficiency. However, performance of flexible perovskite/c-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells still greatly lags, due to challenges in simultaneously achieving both efficient photocarrier transport and reliable mitigation of residual stress. Here, we reveal the critical role of perovskite phase homogeneity, for achieving high-efficient and mechanical-stable flexible perovskite/c-silicon heterojunction monolithic tandem solar cells (PSTs) with textured surface. Through ensuring high phase homogeneity, which promotes charge transfer across all facets of the pyramid on the textured substrates and releases the residual stress at the perovskite/c-silicon interface, we demonstrate flexible PSTs with a bending curvature of 0.44 cm-1, and a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.88% (1.04 cm2 aperture area), surpassing all other types of flexible perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. Our results can lead to broad applications and commercialization of flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem photovoltaics.</p>

            <p>We perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations to explore the self-assembly of a two-dimensional model system of triblock Janus colloids as an example of "patchy" colloids forming complex structures. Previous experiments and simulation studies have shown that such systems are capable of forming a two-dimensional Kagome lattice at room temperatures. However, it is well established that the crystallization is strongly hampered by the formation of long-living metastable aggregates. For this reason, recent studies have investigated activity, i.e., self-propulsion of the Janus particles as a mechanism to accelerate the formation of stable Kagome structures [Mallory and Cacciuto, JACS 141, 2500-2507 (2019)] at selected state points. Here we extend, first, the investigations of active Janus colloids for a broader range of densities and temperatures. We also characterize in detail the associated nucleation of Kagome clusters, as well as their structure in the steady state. Second, to make contact to the equilibrium case, we propose a simple activity time protocol where an initially chosen activity is switched off after a finite time. With this protocol, we not only find Kagome structures in a much broader range of densities than in the purely passive case, but also obtain a Kagome crystallization boundary very close to that proposed in earlier Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>The specific heat anomaly stems from a third-order phase transition in the 2D lattice sine-Gordon model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Loris Di Cairano, Alexandre Tkatchenko</p>
            <p>The specific heat anomaly (SHA) is broadly observed in statistical mechanics, appearing as a smooth, system-size-independent peak in the specific heat, in contrast to the singular behavior typical of second-order phase transitions (PTs). Its origin remains heavily debated: some attribute it to finite-size effects, others to unidentified phase transitions. Here we investigate SHA using the two-dimensional sine-Gordon (2D-sG) model and microcanonical inflection point analysis (MIPA), uncovering two key results. First, we show that the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT under MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous. This clarifies the ambiguity in the literature, where this transition was often, though inconclusively, attributed to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Through the use of MIPA and a comprehensive analysis of standard thermodynamic observables, we provide a coherent thermodynamic characterization that redefines the nature of this transition. Second, we find that the SHA is not itself a PT but rather the thermodynamic fingerprint of this third-order transition. These findings clarify the nature of SHA within the 2D-sG model and suggest that similar anomalies in other systems, such as the XY model, may likewise originate from third-order PTs, rather than mere crossovers. Our results provide a consistent thermodynamic interpretation of the SHA and highlight the broader relevance of third-order transitions in systems previously thought to exhibit only low-order or crossover transition.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the fact that the measured critical field $H_c$ in various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors is poorly understood, we reexamine its scaling behavior with temperature and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By computing the spin-susceptibility in a multipocket system, we find that segments of the Fermi Surface (FS) at which the SOC has nodal points can have a contribution orders of magnitude larger than the remaining FS, hence setting the $H_c$, assuming the presence of a conventional singlet superconducting order parameter. Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed by symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS pocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in gated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements, concluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is consistent with the $H_c(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in contrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we show that the theory is also consistent with data on homobilayer TMDs.</p>

Here we present experimental evidence that large clusters and their hulls are indeed both fractals with dimensions of the corresponding figures in critical percolation models. The asymptotic decay of a crossing probability, from a region in the vicinity of the origin to the boundary of disks, is described by the Lawler-Schramm-Werner theorem provided that a microscopic length in the original formulation is replaced by the coarsening length of the liquid crystal. Furthermore, the behavior for the winding angle of large loops is, at certain scales, compatible with that of Schramm-Loewner evolution curves with diffusivity $\kappa = 6$. These results show an experimental realization of critical clusters in phase ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Hörmann, Reinhard J. Maurer</p>
            <p>The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.</p>

In this paper, we describe a database of 7,024 inorganic materials presenting diverse structures and compositions generated using hybrid functional calculations enabled by their efficient implementation in the all-electron code FHI-aims. The database is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of oxides relevant to catalysis and energy related applications.

Herein, by combining the high-quality growth and advanced characterizations of cubic silicon carbide single crystals with well controlled boron doping, we experimentally observe anomalous strong defect-phonon scatterings, among the strongest reported in common semiconductors, that exceeds the predictions of the classic mass difference model by tens of times in magnitude. The measured thermal conductivity of doped 3C SiC match excellently with those predicted by first principle calculations in which resonant scattering of low frequency phonon is considered.

            <p>The exploration of the superconductivity in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant attention due to their promising low-power applications and fundamental scientific interest. Here, we report some novel stable non-van der Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk exfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles calculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P \overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting transition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed analysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by phonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon coupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by pronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps.

            <p>Kagome lattice decorated with S=1/2 spins is one of the most discussed ways to realize a quantum spin liquid. However, all previous material realizations of this model have suffered from additional complications, ranging from additional interactions to impurity effects. Recently, a new quantum kagome system has been identified in the form of averievite Cu(5-x)ZnxV2O10(CsCl), featuring a unique double-layer spacing between the kagome planes. Using muon spin spectroscopy we show that only a complete substitution (i.e. $x=2$) of interplanar copper ions leads to a quantum-disordered ground state. In contrast, the parent compound ($x=0$) exhibits long-range magnetic order, with a phase transition around 24 K. Experiments performed on the partially substituted material ($x=1$) show that the transformation proceeds through an intermediate disordered, partially frozen ground state, unaffected by pressures up to 23 kbar. Our study provides a microscopic view of the magnetism of the decoupling of the kagome layers and establishes the averievite as a new material platform for the experimental study of the fully-decoupled kagome layers.</p>

            <p>Few-layered potassium nickel and cobalt oxides show drastic differences in catalytic activity based on metal ion preorganization. Uniform compositions $[(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6$ or $(\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ show limited activity, while homogenously-mixed-metal cobalt/nickel oxides $[(\mathrm{Co}_n\mathrm{Ni}_{1-n}\mathrm{O}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ display moderate improvement. However, a layer-by-layer arrangement of cobalt and nickel oxide sheets [e.g., $(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})$] provides superior catalytic performance, reducing the oxygen evolution overpotential by more than 400 mV. Density functional theory simulations provide an illustration of the electronic properties (density of states and localization of orbitals) that promote catalysis in the layer-segregated materials over those of homogeneous composition. This study reveals that atomic preorganization of metal ions within layered catalysts plays a more crucial role than overall metal composition in enhancing catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution.</p>

            <p>The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a geometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility of computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the trajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher information (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we discuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI is and (ii) whether there are any trajectory-level thermodynamic bounds due to the SFI. We find that, contrary to previous results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the thermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive single-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian particle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a decreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds one can derive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the one derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted models and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and that the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similarly to the average and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving velocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not saturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations at the trajectory level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Martin, Tapan Chandra Adhyapak, Holger Stark</p>
            <p>Motility is fundamental to the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. The E. coli bacterium propels itself using a bundle of rotating helical flagella. If one flagellum reverses its rotational direction, it leaves the bundle, performs a polymorphic transformation, and the bacterium tumbles. The E. coli bacterium is hydrodynamically attracted to surfaces. This prolongs its residence time, while tumbling facilitates surface detachment. We develop a model of E. coli that uses an extended Kirchhoff rod theory to implement flagellar flexibility as well as different polymorphic conformations and perform hydrodynamic simulations with the method of multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD). To establish a reference case, we determine the distribution of tumble angles in the bulk fluid, which shows good agreement with experiments for a fixed tumble time. Increasing the hook stiffness, narrows the tumble angle distribution and reduces the flagellar dispersion during tumbling. Close to a bounding surface, the tumble angle distribution is shifted to smaller angles, while flagellar dispersion is reduced. Reorientation within the plane favors the forward direction, which might be an explanation for prolonged run times observed in experiments</p>

            <h2>Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering investigation of Hund's and spin-orbit coupling in $5d^2$ double perovskites</h2>

            <p>$\mathrm{B}$ site ordered $5d^2$ double perovskites ($\mathrm{A_2BB'O_6,\ B'}=5d^2)$ display a remarkable range of physical properties upon variation of the chosen $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{B'}$ site ions. This sensitivity to chemical substitution reflects the delicate balance and profound impact of strong electronic correlation and spin-orbit coupling in such systems. We present rhenium $L_2$ and $L_3$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of two such physically dissimilar materials, Mott-insultating $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ and semiconducting $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$. Despite these differences, our RIXS results reveal similar energy scales of Hund's ($J_H$) and spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda$) in the two materials, with both systems firmly in the intermediate Hund's coupling regime ($\mathcal{O}(J_H/\lambda)\sim 1$). However, there are clear differences in their RIXS spectra. The conductive character of $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$ broadens and obfuscates the atomic transitions within an electron-hole continuum, while the insulating character of $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ results in sharp atomic excitations. This contrast in their RIXS spectra despite their similar energy scales reflects a difference in the itinerancy-promoting hopping integral and illustrates the impact of the local crystal environment in double perovskites. Finally, $L_2$ and $L_3$ edge analyses of the atomic excitations in $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ reveal that the energy scales of Hund's and spin-orbit coupling are in fact inverted compared to previously reported values. We present exact diagonalization calculations of the RIXS spectra at both edges which show good agreement with our results for new energy scales of $\lambda=0.290(5)$ eV and $J_H=0.38(2)$ eV ($J_H/\lambda=1.30(5)$).</p>

            <h2>Chemotactic aggregation dynamics of micro-swimmers in Brinkman flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasser Almoteri, Enkeleida Lushi</p>
            <p>We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective chemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The Brinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the presence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an environment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the linearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of collective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities. We present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can expect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for varying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic coupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that resistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it inhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective swimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions, we find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the swimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and collectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show simulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the phase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the experimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental realizations of this system.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgenii Strugovshchikov, Viktor Mandrolko, Dominika Lesnicki, Mariachiara Pastore, Laurent Chaput, Mykola Isaiev</p>
            <p>Precise control over surface chemistry is essential for tuning interfacial behavior in technologies ranging from catalysis and protective coatings to energy conversion systems. Although chemical functionalization of alpha-quartz (alpha-SiO2) with hydroxyl (OH) and methyl (CH3) groups has been extensively studied, the impact of their spatial distribution at the atomic scale remains largely uncharted. In this work, we integrate density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate how different arrangements of OH/CH3 groups modulate surface properties. Our results reveal that spatial patterning governs the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks, alters vibrational signatures, and has a significant influence on the thermodynamic stability of the functionalized surfaces. The MLFF framework enables high-fidelity simulations at unprecedented scales, bridging the gap between quantum accuracy and statistical sampling. By uncovering structure-property relationships inaccessible to conventional approaches, this study establishes spatial arrangement of functionalized groups as a critical and tunable design axis, paving the way for the predictive engineering of silica-based materials with optimized interfacial performance.</p>

            <h2>A Quieter State of Charge -- Ultra-Low-Noise Collective Current in Charge-Density-Wave Nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Ghosh, Nicholas Sesing, Tina Salguero, Sergey Rumyantsev, Roger K. Lake, Alexander A. Balandin</p>
            <p>In quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) charge-density-wave (CDW) systems, electric current comprises normal electrons and a collective, electron-lattice condensate current associated with CDW sliding. While achieving the dissipation-less Frohlich current of the sliding condensate is impossible in real materials, one can imagine an important related target, namely reaching the electron transport regime where electronic noise is inhibited due to the collective, strongly-correlated nature of the electron-lattice condensate current. Here we report that in nanowires of the fully-gapped CDW material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. This discovery signals intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated transport regime. The dominant noise source due to fluctuations in the CDW depinning threshold is extrinsic and caused by lattice imperfections that locally pin the condensate. Once the bias voltage is well past threshold and the sliding mode is established, the normalized noise drops below the noise of normal electrons. No residual minimum noise level is observed for the current of the condensate. Since flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices, our discovery introduces a fundamentally new strategy for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics using strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the amplitude and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</p>

            <h2>Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Gawełczyk, K. Gawarecki</p>
            <p>Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</p>

C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg, Thomas Gredig, Claudia Ojeda-Aristizabal</p>
            <p>Quantum coherent effects can be probed in multilayer graphene through electronic transport measurements at low temperatures. In particular, bilayer graphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the conductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and dependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a molecular thin film influence these scattering mechanisms, which can be quantified through the known theory of magnetoconductance for bilayer graphene. Here, we present weak localization measurements in a copper-phthalocyanine / bilayer graphene / h-BN heterostructure that suggest an important suppression of trigonal warping effects in bilayer graphene (BLG), restoring the manifestation of the chirality of the charge carriers in the localization properties of BLG. Additionally, we observe a charge transfer of 3.6$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ from the BLG to the molecules, as well as a very small degradation of the mobility of the BLG/h-BN heterostructure upon the deposition of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The molecular arrangement of the CuPc thin film is characterized in a control sample through transmission electron microscopy, that we relate to the electronic transport results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Berta Centro Elía, Marco Antonio Morales, Vanina G. Franco, Jesús Antonio Fuentes García, Gerardo F. Goya</p>
            <p>This study presents a novel approach for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in pig manure wastewater using magnet-ite-based magnetic nanofibers (MNFs) as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. The MNFs, composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) embedded with MnFe_2O_4 nanoparticles, were synthesized via electrospinning and exhibited high stability and catalytic efficiency. The degradation process was driven by hydroxyl radical (OH) formation through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation on the MNF surface. The results showed that TC was first adsorbed onto the MNFs before undergoing oxidation, with treatment efficiency increasing with H2O2 concentration up to an optimum point, due to increased OH scavenging by H_2O_2. A heterogeneous dynamic kinetic model (DKM) was developed to describe the degradation mechanism, incorporating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, catalyst surface inactivation, and polymer strip-ping effects. Furthermore, the application of an alternating magnetic field significantly accelerated the reaction rate, likely due to localized heating effects. This study highlights the potential of MNFs as a scalable, reusable and efficient alternative for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater treatment, offering advantages over conventional homogeneous Fenton processes by minimizing iron sludge formation and broadening the operational pH range.</p>

            <h2>Supervised Pretraining for Material Property Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chowdhury Mohammad Abid Rahman, Aldo H. Romero, Prashnna K. Gyawali</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.</p>

            <h2>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruth Shir, Pablo Martinez-Azcona, Aurélia Chenu</p>
            <p>Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</p>

            <h2>$N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Maeda, Tsubasa Oishi</p>
            <p>Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</p>

            <p>Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal</p>
            <p>The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</p>

Our accurate theoretical predictions are complemented by robust uncertainty quantification, enabling meaningful comparisons with experiments. We demonstrate that a simple nuclear Hamiltonian, based on a leading-order pionless effective field theory expansion and known to accurately reproduce the ground-state energies of nuclei with $A\leq 20$ nucleons also provides a reliable description of the photoabsorption cross section.</p>

High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup.

            <p>Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</p>

The resulting idea of quantum thermodynamic engines holds promise for harvesting novel sources of energy of purely quantum origin, like quantum statistics, to extract mechanical work from macroscopic quantum systems like Bose-Einstein condensates. It also allows one to explore thermodynamic thinking to `small' systems consisting only a few particles in quantum theory. In an earlier paper we had studied the quantum Otto engine using a small number of one-dimensional anyons as the medium to drive the thermodynamic engine. In this sequel, we study the gold-standard of thermodynamic engines, namely the Carnot engine, using two-dimensional anyons as the medium. An explicit expression is derived for the efficiency of the anyonic quantum Carnot engine.</p>

            <h2>Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaoru Mizuta, Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</p>

            <h2>A multireference picture of electronic excited states in vanadyl and copper tetraphenyl porphyrin molecular qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arup Sarkar, Alessandro Lunghi</p>
            <p>The nature of electronic excited states has a deep impact on the dynamics of molecular spins, but remains poorly understood and characterized. Here we carry out a thorough multiconfigurational investigation for two prototypical molecular qubits based on vanadyl and copper tetra-phenyl porphyrins. State-average CASSCF and NEVPT2 calculations have been employed with four different active spaces of growing complexity to account for the d-d, second d-shell, ligand-to-metal charge transfer states and $\pi-\pi^*$ excited states, revealing an in-depth picture of low-lying excited states in agreement with experimental observations. The largest active spaces attempted, (13,14) for the vanadyl and (17,12) for the copper compounds, reveal that the lowest-lying excited states originate from $\pi-\pi^*$ quartet excitations. These findings shed light on the nature of the excited states of molecular qubits, taking an important step toward elucidating their role in molecular spin dynamics.</p>

            <p>The impact semiconductor drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs) can have on high-power microwave applications make them a device of interest for future solid-state electronics. However, there is little known about their functionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power dissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and optimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer DSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its opening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking desynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral region damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Raisinger, Qiwei Zhang, John E. Bolander, Jan Eliáš</p>
            <p>The study investigates the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete, elastically homogeneous models of heterogeneous media. The homogeneity is accomplished either by volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of constitutive function or by an auxiliary stress homogenization method. The elastic parameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to introduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the discrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using statistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard constitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions as well as dependencies between stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of the different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The elastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower strain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material. Randomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of inelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the homogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the damage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of material structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.</p>

            <h2>High-temperature partition functions and classical simulability of long-range quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Jan T. Schneider, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheryne Jonay, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>We investigate a mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in many-body quantum systems arising from destructive interference, leading to localization in Fock space. Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the magnetic properties of Bi0.5Ca0.5MnO3 under ultrahigh magnetic fields by magnetization measurements. This compound shows the metamagnetic transition which indicates the magnetic field induced charge order melting at the room temperature T = 293 K. We reveled that the temperature dependence of the critical field, where the highest critical field is higher than 100 T. At low temperatures, it has been found that the metamagnetic transitions become broad and vanish in the field ascending process below 70 K. On the other hand, in the field descending process, a clear metamagnetic transition is observed even below 70 K. This unusual behavior can be understood as the gradual charge order melting by magnetic field, and its simultaneous reformation. A coexistence of multiple order parameters can account for the observed characteristic dynamics of the first order phase transition. Finally, we constructed the B-T phase diagram with the unusual critical feature at ultrahigh magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a quantum-dot loop</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baksa Kolok, András Pályi</p>
            <p>A quantum system constrained to a degenerate energy eigenspace can undergo a nontrival time evolution upon adiabatic driving, described by a non-Abelian Berry phase. This type of dynamics may provide logical gates in quantum computing that are robust against timing errors. A strong candidate to realize such holonomic quantum gates is an electron or hole spin qubit trapped in a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, whose twofold Kramers degeneracy is protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and quantitatively analyze protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a loop of quantum dots. One of these protocols allows to characterize the local internal Zeeman field directions in the dots of the loop. We expect a near-term realisation of these protocols, as all key elements have been already demonstrated in spin-qubit experiments. These experiments would be important to assess the potential of holonomic quantum gates for spin-based quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Current-biased Josephson junctions can act as detectors of electromagnetic radiation. At optimal conditions, their sensitivity is limited by fluctuations causing stochastic switching from the superconducting to the resistive state. This work provides a quantitative description of a stochastic switching current detector, based on an underdamped Josephson junction. It is shown that activation of a Josephson plasma resonance can greatly enhance the detector responsivity in proportion to the quality factor of the junction. The ways of tuning the detector for achieving optimal operation are discussed. For realistic parameters of Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions, the sensitivity can reach $S\simeq 5\times10^{12}$ (V/W).</p>

            <p>The present study focuses on the intrinsic properties of the SmFe10Co2-xVx (x = 0-2) alloys, which includes the SmFe10Co2 alloy, one of the most promising permanent magnets with the ThMn12 type of structure due to its large saturation magnetization (1.78 T), high Curie temperature (Tc = 859 K), and anisotropy field (12 T) experimentally obtained. Unfortunately, its low coercivity (<0.4 T) hinders its use in permanent magnet applications. The effect of V-doping on magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and Curie temperature is investigated by electronic band structure calculations. The spin-polarized fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) band structure method, which employs the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with substitutional disorder, has been used. The Hubbard-U correction to local spin density approximation (LSDA +U) was used to account for the large correlation effects due to the 4f electronic states of Sm. The computed magnetic moments and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies were compared with existing experimental data to validate the theoretical approach's reliability. The exchange-coupling parameters from the Heisenberg model were used for obtaining the mean-field estimated Curie temperature. The magnetic anisotropy energy was separated into contributions from transition metals and Sm, and its relationships with the local environment, interatomic distances, and valence electron delocalization were analyzed. The suitability of the hypothetical SmFe10CoV alloy for permanent magnet manufacture was assessed using the calculated anisotropy field, magnetic hardness, and intrinsic magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional arrays of ballistic Josephson junctions are important as model systems for synthetic quantum materials. Here, we investigate arrays of multiterminal junctions which exhibit a phase difference $\varphi_0$ at zero current. When applying an in-plane magnetic field we observe nonreciprocal vortex depinning currents. We explain this effect in terms of a ratchet-like pinning potential, which is induced by spontaneous supercurrent loops. Supercurrent loops arise in multiterminal $\varphi_0$-junction arrays as a consequence of next-nearest neighbor Josephson coupling. Tuning the density of vortices to commensurate values of the frustration parameter results in an enhancement of the ratchet effect. In addition, we find a surprising sign reversal of the ratchet effect near frustration 1/3. Our work calls for the search for novel magnetic structures in artificial crystals in the absence of time-reversal symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling Mysteries of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: 3D Magnetism in a layered like Magnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Sarkar, Rohit Pathak, Arnob Mukherjee, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson, Vladislav Borisov</p>
            <p>GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric magnet with a square lattice of Gd atoms, hosts a short-period skyrmion square lattice (SkL) without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). RKKY-type exchange between the Gd moments results in an exchange frustration, which is the main source of non-collinearity in the spiral phases of the system. Previous studies focused on the in-plane $\vec{Q}$ vectors in understanding the magnetic phases of the system as they appear and have been observed on the 2D Gd layers. In this work, we calculate the Gd-Gd magnetic exchange interactions ($J_{ij}$) and perform atomic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, providing new insights about GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our calculated $J_{ij}$ shows that the strongest magnetic interaction occurs between Gd atoms along the [111] body-diagonal direction of the unit cell. This, along with the body-centered tetragonal structure of the Gd sublattice, points to the presence of a hitherto ignored modulation vector, $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along the [111] direction in the spiral phases of the system. ASD simulations confirm this interlayer modulation, demonstrating that GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s magnetic phases are more complex than suggested by 2D layer observations. The total magnetic order is determined by $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$ alongside intralayer $\vec{Q}_{[100]}$ and $\vec{Q}_{[010]}$, establishing GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ as a strong 3D magnet requiring comprehensive theoretical modeling. Considering these, our ASD simulations accurately reproduce experimental phase transitions and highlight the significant role of dipolar interactions (due to the large Gd moment) over a weak uniaxial anisotropy in determining the ground state. This work enhances the understanding of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s complex magnetism, suggesting similar interlayer effects may be important in other layered magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>We report the magnetic properties of the quantum triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) PrMgAl11O19 through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Strong magnetic anisotropy indicates the realization of an Ising-like magnetism in PrMgAl11O19 single crystal while no long-range magnetic ordering is realized down to 0.4 K. The splitting of the low-lying quasi-doublet into two singlets suggested by experimental data, is consistent with an effective pseudospin-1/2 scenario. The observed gapless excitations in zero field are attributed to induced quantum magnetism, they would be induced by magnetic interactions of an energy scale comparable with the splitting between the two singlets. Based on these results, we modeled the magnetic ground state of PrMgAl11O19 by a quantum Ising magnet with an intrinsic transverse field rather than a quantum spin liquid (QSL). In addition, our data show a non-monotonous response of the low-temperature specific heat to the external fields revealing a complex interplay between intrinsic and external magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Schorlepp, Ohad Shpielberg</p>
            <p>Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</p>

            <p>Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K, uniquely exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ $\simeq$ $19$ K. The interplay leads to narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced peak in the creep activation energy, and magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal the presence of very closely-spaced ($w\ll \lambda$) vortex clusters. We attribute these observations to the formation of vortex polarons for which we present a theoretical description. In contrast, we link strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work suggests new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with important applications in high-current conductors.</p>

            <p>We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</p>

            <p>Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p>

Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio e pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1\% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the ``Mozzarella Phase'' and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. \tcr{We further analyze the effect of a less traditional stabilizer, trisodium citrate, and observe a sharp transition from the Mozzarella Phase to a completely smooth and stable sauce, in contrast to starch-stabilized mixtures, where the transition is more gradual.} Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</p>

            <h2>Dirac-Schwinger Quantization for Emergent Magnetic Monopoles?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Farhan (1), M. Saccone (2), B.F.L. Ward (1) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA, (2) Croputation, Santa Fe, NM, USA)</p>
            <p>In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Self-sustained Josephson dynamics and self-trapping in supersolids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitor Alaña, Michele Modugno, Pablo Capuzzi, D. M. Jezek</p>
            <p>We explore the self-sustained Josephson junction dynamics in dipolar supersolids, predicting the possibility of self-trapping alongside the experimentally observed Josephson oscillations [Biagioni, G. et al., Nature 629, 773 (2024)]. Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Hence, the associated Hamiltonian allows us to straightforwardly determine the self-trapping regime. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson junction dynamics across its full range, and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions. We further find that the off-axis droplets move in the radial direction during the evolution in accordance with the size of the central droplet. Such movements do not interfere with the model predictions.</p>

            <h2>Momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling in cuprates by RIXS: the roles of phonon symmetry and electronic structure</h2>

            <p>The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <h2>When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdiel de Jesús Espinosa-Champo, Alejandro Kunold, Gerardo G. Naumis</p>
            <p>Topological phases emerge as the parameters of a quantum system vary with time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be eliminated, allowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a closed trajectory in parameter space. In solid-state physics, this approach is commonly applied by taking a reciprocal space wavevector as the parameter, which is assumed to be varied by electromagnetic this http URL Berry curvature is then obtained by computing the derivatives of Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However, in many systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never satisfied. This is particularly true in Dirac and Weyl materials, where the Berry curvature is often calculated without considering the breakdown of the adiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate how other time-dependent topological quantities, specifically the Aharonov-Anandan phase, can be used to extract information not only about topology but also about band transitions in 2D materials. In particular, a relationship between the current and the Aharonov-Anandan phase is proved, showing that photon-induced transitions produce current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, showing how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights into topology, interband transitions, and currents. This is achieved by using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</h2>

            <p>Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</p>

            <p>Active systems of self-rotating elements inherently exhibit chirality, making them of fundamental interest due to parity violation. Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the gelation of adhesive spinners confined to quasi-2D monolayers at low Reynolds numbers. Unlike the coarsening dynamics of passive colloids, spinner gelation follows a different pathway, displaying structural chirality during the early stages of aggregation. However, this chirality dissipates upon dynamical arrest, resulting in a final gel structure that resembles a conventional colloidal gel. As a result, we find no sign of odd mechanical responses. Nonetheless, the elastic modulus and gelation time remain tunable through spinning activity, providing a new avenue for the bottom-up design of programmable soft materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael D. White, Michael D. Atkinson, Adam J. Plowman, Pratheek Shanthraj</p>
            <p>Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.</p>

            <p>The paper presents a constraint-based collision model for Cosserat rods, able to handle dynamic or static contact between a large number of highly flexible structures. The model provides the required collision impulses prior to updating the solution of the rods, with the impulses accounted for as external loads. The procedure avoids the need to modify the structure solver itself and circumvents any iteration between the collision model and the solver for the Cosserat rods, maintaining the efficiency of any chosen Cosserat solver. The collision model is adopted from Tschisgale et al. (Arch. Appl. Mech., 2019) and extended towards higher stability, which is found necessary in the case of very flexible rods. Furthermore, the model is supplemented with additional terms that arise when the colliding rods are immersed in a fluid. The latter is accounted for by an immersed-boundary method. A large number of tests are conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the final model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karim Aljamal, Xiao Wang</p>
            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energies between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the fine-tuned heat of adsorption model and uptake model qualitatively predict adsorption properties for original unaltered MOFs, they fail to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects at open metal sites significantly impact adsorption behaviors. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</p>

            <p>With density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the influence of Hund's coupling on the nature of electronic correlations in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$. Our results suggest strong signatures of Hund's metal physics in this compound. The Co 3$d$ states show large orbital differentiation in the degree of correlations and mass enhancement. The imaginary-time correlation functions suggest the presence of spin-orbital separation and large local charge fluctuations in the system. Breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture is observed at the lowest calculated temperature for various strengths of Hund's coupling, suggesting the Fermi-liquid coherence scale lower than $\sim$100 K. Interestingly, a sudden emergence of a gapped state is noted for $e_g$ orbitals in its spectral density of states at $\sim$200 K in the vicinity of Fermi-level. Among the Co 3$d$ states 3$d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ foster enlarged correlations. This study conclusively identifies $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ as the first single-layered 3$d$ transition metal oxide to be classified as Hund's metal.</p>

            <p>Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through the entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can be immersed in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In the appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark Xin Hong Goh</p>
            <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erdös--Rényi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</p>

            <p>Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</p>

            <h2>The robustness condition for general disordered discrete time crystals, and subspace-thermal DTCs from phase transitions between different n-tuple DTCs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongye Yu, Tzu-Chieh Wei</p>
            <p>We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</p>

            <h2>Local vs non-local dynamics in cavity-coupled Rydberg atom arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan B. Xavier, Matteo Marinelli, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Ernesto Quintela Rodriguez, Piero Lafiosca, Tommaso Giovannini, Chiara Cappelli</p>
            <p>Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</p>

            <h2>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti</p>
            <p>Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</p>

Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasilii Iugov, Nikita Nekrasov</p>
            <p>We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by this http URL and this http URL long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-driven quantum phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders of electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André Haug, Ravi Kumar, Tomer Firon, Misha Yutushui, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David F. Mross, Yuval Ronen</p>
            <p>Topological and crystalline orders of electrons both benefit from enhanced Coulomb interactions in partially filled Landau levels. In bilayer graphene (BLG), the competition between fractional quantum Hall liquids and electronic crystals can be tuned electrostatically. Applying a displacement field leads to Landau-level crossings, where the interaction potential is strongly modified due to changes in the orbital wave functions. Here, we leverage this control to investigate phase transitions between topological and crystalline orders at constant filling factors in the lowest Landau level of BLG. Using transport measurements in high-quality hBN-encapsulated devices, we study transitions as a function of displacement field near crossings of $N=0$ and $N=1$ orbitals. The enhanced Landau-level mixing near the crossing stabilizes electronic crystals at all fractional fillings, including a resistive state at $\nu = \frac{1}{3}$ and a reentrant integer quantum Hall state at $\nu = \frac{7}{3}$. On the $N=0$ side, the activation energies of the crystal and fractional quantum Hall liquid vanish smoothly and symmetrically at the transition, while the $N=1$ transitions out of the crystal appear discontinuous. Additionally, we observe quantized plateaus forming near the crystal transition at half filling of the $N=0$ levels, suggesting a paired composite fermion state stabilized by Landau level mixing.</p>

            <p>Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.</p>

            <p>Below a continuous symmetry breaking phase transition, the relevant collective excitations are due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the order parameter, which are referred to as Higgs and Goldstone modes, respectively. In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the equivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states accessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite difficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy Goldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this work, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material CuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved second harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light pulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric dipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in the amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and thus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to the Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the excitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon, distinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is due to the Goldstone mode.</p>

            <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

            <h2>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Erb, Nadav Shaibe, Tsampikos Kottos, Steven M. Anlage</p>
            <p>Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</p>

            <p>Twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) has emerged as an ideal model system for investigating novel strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, the experimental construction of tFLG with high structural stability is still challenging. Here, we introduce a highly accessible method for fabricating robust tFLG by polymer micro-tip manipulated origami. Through using a self-prepared polymer micro-tip, which is composed of multiple dimethylpolysiloxane, poly(vinyl chloride), and graphite sheets, to fold graphene layers, we fabricated tFLG with different twist angles (0°-30°) and various layers, including twisted bilayers (1+1), twisted double-bilayers (2+2), twisted double-trilayers (3+3), and thicker layers. Even ABC-stacked tFLG were created, such as twisted ABC/ABC and ABC/ABA graphene coexisting in an ABC-ABA domain wall region. We found that the origami-fabricated tFLG exhibits high stability against thermal and mechanical perturbations including heating and transferring, which could be attributed to its special folding and tearing structures. Moreover, based on the rich types of samples, we revealed twist-angle and stacking-order dependent Raman characteristics of tFLG, which is valuable for understanding the stacking-modulated phonon spectroscopy. Our experiments provide a simple and efficient approach to construct structurally robust tFLG, paving the way for the study of highly stable twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Planar Nernst effect from hidden band geometry in layered two-dimensional materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Biswas, Harsh Varsney, Amit Agarwal</p>
            <p>The Nernst effect is a versatile phenomenon relevant for energy harvesting, magnetic sensing, probing band topology and charge-neutral excitations. The planar Nernst effect (PNE) generates an in-plane voltage transverse to an applied temperature gradient under an in-plane magnetic field. Conventional Berry curvature-induced PNE is absent in two-dimensional (2D) systems, as the out-of-plane Berry curvature does not couple to the in-plane electron velocity. We challenge this notion by demonstrating a distinct planar Nernst effect in quasi-2D materials (2DPNE). We show that the 2DPNE originates from previously overlooked planar components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, arising from inter-layer tunneling in multilayered 2D systems. We comprehensively analyze the band-geometric origin and crystalline symmetry constraints on 2DPNE responses. We illustrate its experimental feasibility in strained bilayer graphene. Our findings significantly expand the theoretical understanding of planar Nernst effects, providing a clear pathway for next-generation magnetic sensing and energy-harvesting applications.</p>

            <p>Static and dynamical magnetic and electronic properties of the kagome metal Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ have been investigated by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The temperature dependence of Knight shift ($K$) shows a similar temperature dependence of the DC magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ except for the low-temperature region below $\sim$ 50 K where $K$ is almost constant while $\chi$ keeps increasing, which suggests that the increase in $\chi$ at low temperatures is not intrinsic. $^{27}$Al spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature ($1/T_1T$) is found to be constant, confirming the metallic state of Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ from a microscopic point of view. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$ data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$. These fluctuations are suggested to be very slow with frequencies on the order of kilohertz or lower.</p>

            <p>Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on InSb nanoflags have recently emerged as an intriguing platform in superconducting electronics. This letter presents the fabrication and investigation of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing InSb nanoflag JJs. We provide measurements of interference patterns in both symmetric and asymmetric geometries. The interference patterns in both configurations can be modulated by a back-gate voltage, a feature well reproduced through numerical simulations. The observed behavior aligns with the skewed current-phase relations of the JJs, demonstrating significant contributions from higher harmonics. We explore the magnetic field response of the devices across a wide range of fields ($\pm 30$ mT), up to the single-junction interference regime, where a Fraunhofer-like pattern is detected. Finally, we assess the flux-to-voltage sensitivity of the SQUIDs to evaluate their performance as magnetometers. A magnetic flux noise of $S^{1/2}_\Phi = 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \Phi_0 / \sqrt{Hz}$ is identified, indicating potential applications in nanoscale magnetometry.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of Xenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), phosphorene, and transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), which are separated by insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The knowledge of the energy spectrum completely defines the dynamics of a quantum system for a given initial state. This makes spectroscopy a key characterization technique when studying or designing qubits and complex quantum systems. In semiconductor quantum dots, the electronic quantum states can be probed through charge transport spectroscopy, but the electric current itself disrupts the fragile quantum system, and the technique is practically limited to gate-defined quantum dots. Epitaxial quantum dots benefit from excellent optical properties, but are usually incompatible with charge transport, while alternative spectroscopy techniques provide only limited information. Here we demonstrate a spectroscopy technique which utilizes nuclear spins as a non-invasive probe. By using spin currents instead of the charge currents we achieve near-equilibrium probing. Experiments are conducted on low-strain GaAs/AlGaAs epitaxial dots, revealing energy spectra for charge configurations with up to seven electrons and the subtle properties of the multi-electron states. The rich variety of observations includes long-lived spin-qubit states in s and p shells, ground-state phase transitions, strong spin-orbit coupling regimes, and anomalously fast nuclear spin diffusion. Experiments are backed up by good agreement with the first-principles configuration-interaction numerical modelling. Our work uncovers few-electron states as a new operating regime for optically active quantum dots. Accurate control and probing of many-body states offers a test-bed system for fundamental physics studies, while prospective technological applications include electron spin qubits with extended coherence and scalable electrical control.</p>

            <p>The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</p>

            <p>Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-induced first-order superfluid transition in unitary $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgii Kalagov</p>
            <p>We investigate the superfluid phase transition in an $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric Fermi gas with $N$ distinct spin states using the functional renormalization group. To capture pairing phenomena beyond mean-field theory, we introduce an auxiliary bosonic field and employ the leading order of the derivative expansion of the partially bosonized effective average action. By discretizing the effective potential on a grid and numerically integrating the flow equations, we resolve the thermodynamic behavior near the transition. Our results reveal a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition for $N \geq 4$, which is absent at the mean-field level. In the unitary regime, we provide quantitative predictions for the critical temperature, as well as for the discontinuities in the superfluid gap and entropy density as functions of $N$. With increasing $N$, the critical temperature decreases, while the discontinuities become more pronounced, indicating a stronger first-order transition.</p>

            <h2>Charge and pair density waves in a spin and valley-polarized system at a Van-Hove singularity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avigail Gil, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We study a single component (i.e., single valley, spin-polarized) two-dimensional electron gas with $C_{3v}$ symmetry tuned to a Van-Hove (VH) singularity. Generically, there may be either three or six VH points at the Fermi level, related to each other by symmetry. Using a renormalization group analysis, we show that when the effective interactions between electrons at the VH points are positive, the system is stable. In contrast, if the effective interactions are negative, the system develops an instability toward either pair density wave (PDW) or charge density wave (CDW) orders, depending on the anisotropy of the dispersion at the VH points. The PDW may have either a single wavevector or multiple wavevectors. The PDW phase with three coexisting wavevectors can support fractional $\tfrac{h}{6e}$ vortices. The interplay between the geometry of the Fermi surface and the singularity of the density of states is the key that enables PDW formation.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.</p>

            <h2>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in microscopic single-crystal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ devices</h2>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity is a quintessential unconventional quantum state. In Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests itself in the supercurrent interference pattern as the invariance of the critical current under the reversal of both transport and magnetic field directions, i.e., $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$. So far, such systems have been realized in devices where superconductivity is injected into a deliberately constructed weak link medium, usually carefully tuned by external magnetic fields and electrostatic gating. In this work, we report time-reversal symmetry breaking in spontaneously emerging Josephson junctions without intentionally constructed weak links. This is realized in ultra-pure single-crystal microstructures of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, an unconventional superconductor with a multi-component order parameter. Here, the Josephson effect emerges intrinsically at the superconducting domain wall, where the degenerate states partially overlap. In addition to violating $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$, we find a rich variety of exotic transport phenomena, including a supercurrent diode effect present in the entire interference pattern, two-channel critical current oscillations with a period that deviates from $\Phi_0$, fractional Shapiro steps, and current-switchable bistable states with highly asymmetric critical currents. Our findings provide direct evidence of TRSB in unstrained Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and reveal the potential of domain wall Josephson junctions, which can emerge in any superconductor where the pairing symmetry is described by a multi-component order parameter.</p>

            <p>An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/Å and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aarya Bothra, Arti Garg</p>
            <p>Discrete time crystals (DTC) have emerged as significant phase of matter for out-of-equilibrium many-body systems in recent years. Here, we study the role of long-range interactions and disorder in stabilizing the DTC phase. Generally, it is believed that a stable DTC phase can be realized in disordered systems with short-range interactions. We study the periodically driven quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of Ising spin-glass in which all spins are coupled to each other with random couplings. We explore the possibility of DTC phase within three different driving protocols. For all the cases, quantum SK model shows a robust DTC phase with no initial state dependence at all. We compare the periodically driven SK model with other models of long-range interactions with uniform coefficients where randomness is induced through a local field. In complete contrast to the SK model, these models show strong initial state dependence with a large number of initial states showing decay in periodic oscillations in spin-spin correlation function with time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuma Nagao, Daisuke Yamamoto, Seiji Yunoki, Ippei Danshita</p>
            <p>Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of Conventional and Spin-Exchange Auger Recombination in Magnetically Doped Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valerio Pinchetti, Ho Jin, Clément Livache, Victor I. Klimov</p>
            <p>Auger processes play a critical role in the behavior of colloidal quantum dots (QDs). While nonradiative Auger recombination is a key performance-limiting factor in light-emitting applications, Auger effects also present exciting opportunities for hot-carrier manipulation in emerging optoelectronic and photochemical technologies. Recent studies have shown that incorporating magnetic manganese (Mn) dopants into QDs enables an ultrafast spin-exchange (SE) mechanism that significantly accelerates Auger recombination and related processes. However, the fundamental dynamics of SE-Auger recombination, including its dependence on QD size, exciton multiplicity, and Mn-ion content, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SE-Auger recombination in Mn-doped QDs across three regimes defined by the energetic alignment between the QD band-edge exciton and the internal Mn spin-flip transition: resonant, downhill, and uphill, corresponding to the exciton energy being approximately equal to, greater than, or smaller than the Mn spin-flip transition energy, respectively. We find that SE-Auger recombination dominates multiexciton dynamics in both resonant and downhill regimes, proceeding on ultrafast, sub-picosecond timescales, that is, significantly faster than conventional Auger decay. Notably, SE-Auger lifetimes are primarily governed by the occupancy of intrinsic excitonic states, with minimal dependence on QD size or the number of excited Mn ions. In the uphill regime, SE-Auger recombination coexists with conventional Auger processes, enabling direct comparison of their timescales alongside co-occurring hot-carrier cooling. These findings establish that SE-Auger recombination outpaces phonon-assisted cooling, making it uniquely suited for the generation and manipulation of hot carriers, and opening new avenues in advanced photoconversion and photochemistry.</p>

            <p>The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Maximizing Infrared Transmission Contrast Upon Phase Transition of Thermally Grown Vanadium Dioxide Thin Films by Rapid Thermal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Araki, Vishwa Krishna Rajan, Liping Wang</p>
            <p>Pristine vanadium dioxide (VO2), an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) material, is grown via furnace oxidation followed by rapid thermal annealing with forming gas (5%H2/95%N2) which reduces surface over-oxides such as V2O5 formed during the oxidation. The evolutional IMT behaviors of the thermochromic film and vanadium oxide states over different reduction time are systematically studied with temperature-dependent infrared spectrometry, electrical resistivity, and X-ray diffraction measurements. After optimally reducing surface over-oxides to VO2, infrared transmission contrast upon phase transition is enhanced to 46% (at 9 um wavelength) compared to 23% from fully oxidation without any reduction. Moreover, pristine VO2 thin film obtained from thermal oxidation and optimal reduction processes exhibits sharp phase transition and narrow thermal hysteresis within 2~4°C in both infrared transmission and electrical resistivity, which are comparable to the VO2 of best quality prepared by other sophisticated fabrication techniques. The thermally grown method presented here would facilitate the scalable fabrication of high-quality VO2 thin films and tunable radiative coatings for high-performance thermal control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

            <p>In the fusion environment, understanding the synergistic effects of transmutation-produced hydrogen (H), helium (He), and irradiation-induced displacement damage in iron-based alloys is crucial for the development of structural materials for fusion reactors. When H and He atoms are simultaneously introduced into the matrix, the interaction between irradiation-induced cavity defects (voids and bubbles) with H and He, along with their evolutionary behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, the evolutionary behavior of cavities in body-centered cubic (BCC) iron (Fe) with H and He atoms is systematically investigated through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and statistical thermodynamics. First, an efficient and suitable set of Fe-H-He ternary potential functions for describing interatomic interactions is established. Based on the newly developed MD model, the evolutionary behavior of H/He atoms and cavities is systematically investigated under various temperature and cavity structure conditions. Specifically, the kinetic process of H/He capture by cavities is elucidated for different scenarios. Additionally, thermodynamic analyses are employed to assess the feasibility of cavity trapping of H under varying conditions. The results exhibit strong consistency with experimental results and provide significant evidence supporting the formation of the core-shell structure (where He is confined at the cavity center while H accumulates at the surface) from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. This work provides mechanistic insights into the nucleation and growth of cavities over extended temporal and spatial scales in the presence of H-He synergies.</p>

            <p>A theoretical model of the formation of an amorphous phase during the quenching of a metallic melt is proposed. It has been shown that the appearance of a significant temperature gradient during the quenching of a metallic melt leads to thermodiffusion of defects and their outflow from the melt volume, which manifests itself in a significant reduction in the number of free spaces for the diffusion transfer of the atoms of the melt. Due to the thermodiffusion process, a significant restructuring of the microstructure of the medium occurs, which leads to a significant increase in viscosity, a decrease in the diffusion coefficient and specific volume of the substance, and changes in the mechanisms of deformation. The corresponding calculations of temperature distribution, thermodiffusion and distribution of the components of the melt have been carried out.</p>

            <p>Quantum criticality, with both static and dynamic information of the system intrinsically encoded in characteristic length scales, serves as one of the most sensitive and universal probes to monitor quantum phase transition. Qualitatively different quantum criticality behaviours have been widely observed even in the same condensed matter system. The discrepancy is attributed to sample specificity but has not been systemically addressed. Here we report a single-parameter driven three-stage evolution of quantum criticality unveiled in superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} flakes. The evolution starts with a single quantum critical point emerging at the boundary between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases, then evolving into anomalous quantum Griffiths singularity at the medium doping levels and eventually being replaced by quantum Griffiths singularity in the deep superconducting regime. A puddle model that incorporates the developments of antiferromagnetic correlation can capture the evolution. The results offer a new aspect to examine previous seemingly sample-specific quantum critical behavior and lay the foundation for further exploring complex quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems; meanwhile they shed light on the detailed interaction between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in cuprates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Richard, Mehdi Bouzid</p>
            <p>Dispersed colloidal particles within a suspension can aggregate and spontaneously self-organize into a robust, percolating structure known as a gel. These network-like structures are prevalent in nature and play a critical role in many industrial processes, including those involving batteries, food products, and pharmaceutical formulations. In this paper, we examine the emergence of elasticity in colloidal gels. We show that gelation is governed by a rigidity percolation transition. We identify a characteristic correlation length that quantifies the extent of elastic and structural inhomogeneities, which diverges at the critical point. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the interaction types, the particle concentration, or the specific route to non-ergodicity i.e. the preparation protocol, the elastic moduli and vibrational properties of gels can be accurately predicted within a unifying framework, in which the bending modes of fractal clusters -- approximately the size of this correlation length -- dominate under small deformations.</p>

By analyzing the system at zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum distributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order correlation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the momentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of non-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel oscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the density-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work illustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between bosonic and fermionic correlations.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric altermagnets (FEAMs) offer unique magnetoelectric coupling properties by combining the characteristics of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, yet their multifunctional electric control remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce and investigate a scenario for the simultaneous electrical switching of electronic spin and magnonic chirality splitting in two-dimensional FEAMs. Based on the C2DB database, employing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we study prototypical candidates CrPS$_3$ and V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl. We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises from asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the $xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric polarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining [C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing the ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic spin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes. This shows these materials as dual-switchable FEAMs, enabling unified electrical manipulation of electron and magnon properties. A potentially experimentally detectable method via the magneto-optical Kerr effect was derived. This work provides a materials-specific realization and theoretical basis for designing novel electrically controlled multifunctional spintronic, spin caloritronic, and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhong, Rui Wang, Xingao Gong, Hongjun Xiang</p>
            <p>The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex systems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing machine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by introducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that is applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian into spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2) symmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this decomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two components, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude discrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves remarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related component) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput screening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise predictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for system-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for rapid discovery of quantum materials.</p>

Despite their compelling properties as high-capacity Li-ion battery cathode materials, very little is known about the electronic and magnetic properties of lithium-rich antiperovskites. We report static magnetization, Mössbauer, and NMR studies on both compounds. Our data reveal a Pauli paramagnetic-like behaviour, a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered ground state below 50 K and a regime of short-range magnetic correlations up to 100 K. Our results are consistent with a random Li-Fe distribution on the shared lattice position. In addition, Li-hopping is observed above 200 K with an activation energy of E$_a$ = 0.47 eV. Overall, our data elucidate static magnetism in a disordered magnetically frustrated and presumably semimetallic system with thermally induced ion diffusion dynamics.</p>

            <p>The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic systems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.</p>

            <p>Premelting at the ice-polymer interfaces, in which a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) forms below the melting point, is strongly influenced by polymer surface chemistry; however, the molecular-scale mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study employs large-scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning-assisted analysis to elucidate how polymer type (hydrophilic vs hydrophobic) modulates interfacial premelting. Our simulations reveal that hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer surfaces have distinct effects on the QLL thickness, interfacial water structure, and diffusivity. Specifically, a hydrophilic polymer interface promotes a thicker QLL with more ordered interfacial water and lower diffusivity, whereas a hydrophobic interface induces a thinner QLL with a less ordered interfacial water structure and higher diffusivity. These results advance the understanding of polymer-mediated interfacial melting phenomena and offer guidance for designing anti-icing and low-friction materials.</p>

The presented detection scheme allows to detect $J$-changing excitation, \textit{i.e}, alterations of spin and orbital states, even in samples without net magnetization. This makes branching-ratio spectroscopy a powerful tool for the quantitative investigation of ultrafast changes in angular momentum $J$.</p>

            <h2>Ferroelectric and Hyper Dielectric modes in Ferronematic Liquid Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Uttam, Neelam Yadav, Alexander Belik, Wanhe Jiang, Georg H. Mehl, Jagdish K. Vij, Yuri P. Panarin</p>
            <p>Binary mixtures of the ferronematic compound DIO with recently reported non-ferroelectric material WJ-16 which shows Colossal Permittivity (CP) ~5000 and superparaelectricity (SPE) were studied by POM, electrical switching studies, and dielectric spectroscopy. Three mixtures with different contents of WJ-16 as 10, 25 and 50% in DIO as host were prepared. Our original expectation was the development of new nematic materials with both ferroelectric nematic (NF) and non-ferroelectric CP phases. The non-ferroelectric phase in mixtures exhibits a CP mode originally observed in pure WJ-16 and was termed as superparaelectric. However, the dielectric spectroscopy of mixtures shows two distinct relaxation processes: the typical paraelectric response and the CP mode. Therefore, this CP mode cannot be called superparaelectric and is redefined it as Hyper Dielectric mode. This is the first direct demonstration of materials with both ferroelectric and Hyper-dielectric phases in liquid crystalline materials. The hyper dielectric phase has a good potential as a working media for supercapacitors industry.</p>

            <h2>Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phanindra Dewan, Soumyadeep Mondal, Sumantra Sarkar</p>
            <p>Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of recurrent neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shotaro Takasu, Toshio Aoyagi</p>
            <p>Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Xu-Tao Zeng, Huiying Liu, Cong Xiao, Xian-Lei Sheng, Shengyuan A. Yang</p>
            <p>The intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect proposed in recent studies offers a new way to probe intrinsic band geometric properties in a large class of materials. However, the search of material platforms with a large response remains a problem. Here, we suggest that topological Weyl semimetals can host enhanced intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect. From a model study, we show that the enhancement is mainly from the orbital contribution, and the response coefficient exhibits a characteristic resonance-like lineshape around the Weyl-point energy. Using first-principles calculations, we confirm these features for the concrete material CuTlSe$_{2}$. Previous studies have reported two different topological states of CuTlSe$_{2}$. We find this difference originates from two slightly different structures with different lattice parameters. We show that the nonlinear planar Hall response is much stronger in the Weyl semimetal state than in the topological insulator state, and the large response is indeed dominated by orbital contribution amplified by Weyl points. Our work reveals a close connection between nonlinear orbital responses and topological band features, and suggests CuTlSe$_{2}$ as a suitable platform for realizing enhanced nonlinear planar Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</p>

            <p>The physics of the Kagome metal LaRh$_3$B$_2$ along with its superconductivity below 2.6 K, unlike other popular Kagome metals, is not known to be significantly influenced by the electron correlations. While the indirect techniques to probe the bulk superconducting properties of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ indicate a conventional isotropic order parameter, we show that the direct spectroscopic determination of the superconducting energy gap reveals an anomalous suppression of Andreev reflection between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and a normal metal. This observation hints to the presence of incomplete superconducting gap formation, at least along certain momentum directions, and consequent low-lying quasiparticle states. An analysis of multiple Andreev reflection spectra captured at different points on the surface of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ reveals a distribution of the superconducting energy gap which is consistent with an anisotropic superconducting order parameter.</p>

            <p>The challenge of increasing copper (Cu) resistivity with diminishing Cu interconnect dimensions in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, along with the imperative for efficient electron transport paths to fulfill scaling requirements in interconnects is significant. First-principles electronic structures calculations based on density functional theory have been performed to evaluate the potential scalability of some Cu, Al, Ru and Mo based binary alloys to replace Cu. We evaluate the expected sensitivity of the resistivity of these binary alloys to reduced line dimensions with a figure of merit that is based on generalized finite-temperature transport tensors. These transport tensors allow for a straightforward comparison between highly anisotropic intermetallics with given transport directions and Cu, and are evaluated together with their resistance to electromigration. Based on the figure-of-merit analysis, we identify several aluminides that show potential to outperform Cu at reduced interconnect dimensions in terms of their electronic transport and reliability properties.</p>

            <h2>Non-Classical Spin-Phonon Correlations Induced by Rydberg Facilitation in a Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Brady, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between mechanical forces and the internal-state dynamics of a chain of Rydberg atoms trapped in tweezer arrays under the facilitation constraint. Dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms couple electronic (spin) degrees of freedom with excited motional (phonon) states. We show that this interaction leads to highly correlated and non-classical phonon states in the form of squeezed center of mass position states of the Rydberg atoms. Coupling with either a normal or an inverted Lennard-Jones-type potential, resulting from an avoided crossing of Rydberg potential curves, leads to in-phase or out-of-phase correlated oscillations in the atom positions respectively. Furthermore, the growth dynamics of a finite cluster of excited Rydberg atoms can be mapped to the dynamics of a single particle in a semi-infinite lattice subject to a linear potential gradient caused by spin-phonon interactions. This results in Bloch oscillations in the spin cluster size, which in turn localize spin excitations in the system.</p>

            <p>Within the tight-binding model taking into account the Coulomb repulsion of electrons at one site (the Hubbard model), an exact calculation of the Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function of the C2 dimer as a structural element of fullerene, the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the studied nanosystem, was performed. Graphic representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of state of electrons were obtained. A solution for the dimer was obtained within the approximation of static fluctuations. The Fourier transform of the anticommutator Green's function, obtained in the approximation of static fluctuations, coincided with a similar function obtained within the exact solution. The ionization energy and electron affinity were calculated and found to be 11.87 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively. It was concluded that the method for solving the Hubbard model for the C2 dimer in the approximation of static fluctuations proposed in the work can be a fairly adequate method for theoretical study of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Grumm, Malte Selig, Holger Lange, Andreas Knorr</p>
            <p>Based on the momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation, we provide self-consistent numerical calculations of the dynamics of conduction electrons in thin noble metal films after linear and non-linear optical excitations with infrared and terahertz frequencies. Focusing exclusively on electron-phonon interaction, orientational relaxation is introduced and acts as dephasing of the optical excitation on a scale of tens of fs. In the linear regime, our numerical results agree with the experimental fits to a Drude model and predicts for non-linear excitations a field strength dependency of the orientational relaxation rate. In the THz regime, where the orientational relaxation proceeds faster than the oscillation cycle of the excitation THz field, a new high order dissipative Kerr-type non-linearity is predicted. This non-linearity originates from the Pauli blocking included in the electron-phonon scattering and results in a non-linearly increasing transmission of the film, detectable in experiments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the momentum-resolved dynamics of conduction electrons in noble metals following ultrashort optical excitation with linearly polarized light. Using a momentum-resolved Boltzmann equation approach for electron-phonon interaction, we solve for the combined effects of orientational relaxation, thermalization, and cooling. We introduce momentum orientational relaxation as the initial step in the equilibration of an optically excited non-equilibrium electron gas by highlighting its importance for the optical response of noble metals and the dephasing of plasmonic excitations. Our numerical results for gold reveal that orientational relaxation exists independently of the absorbed optical energy and dominates on time scales on the first tens of fs after excitation. Incorporating also thermalization and cooling on times up to a few ps, our approach provides a simultaneous description of optical and thermal properties of noble metals under initial non-equilibrium conditions.</p>

The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species.

            <p>The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys, particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1.

            <p>RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.</p>

The model relies on density-functional tight binding to obtain the electronic Hamiltonian, producing the electronic energy levels and wave functions. They are used to calculate the electron heat capacity, electron heat conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter at the electronic temperatures up to 25,000 K. It is revealed that stainless steel nonthermally melts at sub-picosecond timescales at the deposited dose of ~1.4 eV/atom (the electronic temperature $T_e \sim 10,000$ K): the atomic lattice disorders due to modifications of the interatomic potential induced by the excitation of electrons, even without electron-phonon coupling (Born-Oppenheimer approximation). Including the electron-phonon coupling (non-Born-Oppenheimer simulation) lowers the damage threshold dose to ~0.45 eV/atom, triggering atomic disorder at picosecond timescales via thermal melting, predicated on the atomic heating by electrons.</p>

            <p>We investigate the local crystal-field environment of cerium in the clathrate compound CeBa$_7$Au$_6$Si$_{40}$ (Ce-BAS) using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Ce-BAS is a rare example of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy rattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a temperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static crystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing between the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large internal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are well described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an energy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field states. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework points to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute this to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated with the Ce rattling motion. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical predictions of phonon-enhanced Kondo effects and dynamical Jahn-Teller distortions. Our results highlight the need for multi-orbital impurity models that include phonon coupling to fully describe the low-energy physics of Ce-BAS.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. Saha, M. Singh, P. D. Babu, S. Patnaik</p>
            <p>Magnetization relaxation dynamics serve as an essential tool for uncovering the intrinsic mechanisms governing the magnetic response and energy dissipation in magnetic systems. In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta Mn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 kHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to follow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole formalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture frequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to successfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional relaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the order of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of relaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like structure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation dynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero difference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases implies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of finite dissipation in pure phases. The inertial term has been previously invoked to describe the dynamics in spin ice systems due to the propagation of magnetic monopoles. However, its necessity in this system, points to a wider significance in magnetization dynamics that goes beyond the conventional spin ices and skyrmions.</p>

            <p>We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Xuan Li, Yicheng Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu</p>
            <p>We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for realizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana zero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral Majorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable Majorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and Néel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic supercurrent suppression and revivals in a graphene-based Josephson junction under in-plane magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Schmidt, Katarina Stanojević, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Bernd Beschoten, Vincent Mourik, Christoph Stampfer</p>
            <p>We report on a tunable Josephson junction formed by a bilayer graphene ribbon encapsulated in WSe$_2$ with superconducting niobium contacts. We characterize the junction by measurements of the magnetic field induced interference pattern, and the AC Josephson effect manifested as "Shapiro steps", examining current dependent hysteresis and junction dynamics. The latter can be tuned by temperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field. Finally, we examine the evolution of the supercurrent when subjected to in-plane magnetic fields. Notably, we observe a strong anisotropy in the supercurrent with respect to the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. When the field is parallel to the current direction, the supercurrent is suppressed, and shows revivals with increasing magnetic field, whereas it remains almost unaffected when the field is oriented in a perpendicular direction. We suggest that this anisotropy is caused by the dependence of supercurrent interference on the junction geometry.</p>

            <h2>Infinite temperature transport in the strong coupling regime of a nonintegrable quantum spin chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Hua Li</p>
            <p>We study spin transport of the XXZ model with next-nearest neighbor $\Delta_2$ terms. We compute numerically dependence of spin conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ on the anisotropy $\Delta$ and the ratio $r= \Delta_2/\Delta$, in the large $\Delta$ regime. We find that, when $0<r<1$, the low-frequency conductivity assumes an anomalous form $\sigma(\omega)\approx a \omega^2 + b \Delta^{-2} $. In particular, when $\Delta\to\infty$ the model becomes dynamically constrained and most states are localized. We show, microscopically, existence of magnon bound states in the strong coupling regime, which behave as self-generated disorders for single magnons. Based on this quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytical scalings, which match well with the numerical results.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative particle dynamics models of encapsulated microbubbles and gas vesicles for biomedical ultrasound simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolaos Ntarakas, Maša Lah, Daniel Svenšek, Tilen Potisk, Matej Praprotnik</p>
            <p>Ultrasound-guided drug and gene delivery (usdg) enables controlled and spatially precise delivery of drugs and macromolecules, encapsulated in microbubbles (embs) and submicron gas vesicles (gvs), to target areas such as cancer tumors. It is a non-invasive, high precision, low toxicity process with drastically reduced drug dosage. Rheological and acoustic properties of gvs and embs critically affect the outcome of usdg and imaging. Detailed understanding and modeling of their physical properties is thus essential for ultrasound-mediated therapeutic applications. State-of-the-art continuuum models of shelled bodies cannot incorporate critical details such as varying thickness of the encapsulating shell or specific interactions between its constituents and interior or exterior solvents. Such modeling approaches also do not allow for detailed modeling of chemical surface functionalizations, which are crucial for tuning the gv-blood interactions. We develop a general particle-based modeling framework for encapsulated bodies that accurately captures elastic and rheological properties of gvs and embs. We use dissipative particle dynamics to model the solvent, the gaseous phase in the capsid, and the triangulated surfaces of immersed objects. Their elastic behavior is studied and validated through stretching and buckling simulations, eigenmode analysis, shear flow simulations, and comparison of predicted gv buckling pressure with experimental data from the literature. The presented modeling approach paves the way for large-scale simulations of encapsulated bodies, capturing their dynamics, interactions, and collective behavior.</p>

            <h2>Epitaxial growth of BaBiO3 thin films on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy and controlling their crystal orientations competition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Islam Ahmed, Stefan De Gendt, Clement Merckling</p>
            <p>BaBiO3 has lately gained high research attention as a parent material for an interesting family of alloyed compositions with multiple technological applications. In order to grow a variety of structures, a versatile deposition tool such as molecular beam epitaxy has to be employed. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of BaBiO3 on SrTiO3(001) and MgO(001) substrates is studied. When grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(001) or MgO(001) substrates, BaBiO3 is known to have two competing orientations namely, (001) and (011). Characterization of the thin film is carried out by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Pathways to block the growth of BaBiO3(011) and only grow the technologically relevant BaBiO3(001) are described for both substrates. Understanding of the enabler mechanism of the co-growth is established from epitaxy point of view. This can be beneficially utilized for growth of the different compositions of BaBiO3 material family in a more controlled manner.</p>

            <h2>Post-buckling of fiber-reinforced soft tissues</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Rui-Cheng Liu, Wanyu Ma, Alain Goriely</p>
            <p>Fiber-reinforcement is a universal feature of many biological tissues. It involves the interplay between fiber stiffness, fiber orientation, and the elastic properties of the matrix, influencing pattern formation and evolution in layered tissues. Here, we investigate the deformation of a compressed film bonded to a half-space, where either the film or the substrate exhibits anisotropy. Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear incremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These analyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for surface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show that the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio between the substrate and the film moduli. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fiber-reinforcement in shaping pattern formation in anisotropic tissues and provide insights into the morphological evolution of biological tissues.</p>

            <p>In strongly correlated transition metal dichalcogenides, an intricate interplay of polaronic distortions, stacking arrangement, and electronic correlations determines the nature of the insulating state. Here, we study the response of the electronic structure to optical excitations to reveal the effect of chemical electron doping on this complex interplay. Transient changes in pristine and electron-doped 1$T$ -TaS$_2$ are measured by femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and compared to theoretical modeling based on non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory. The fine changes in the oscillatory signal of the charge density wave amplitude mode indicate phase-dependent modifications in the Coulomb interaction and the hopping. Furthermore, we find an enhanced fraction of monolayers in the doped system. Our work demonstrates how the combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and advanced theoretical modeling provides insights into the physics of correlated transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>
