            <h2>Terahertz electrodynamics in a zero-field Wigner crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Su-Di Chen, Ruishi Qi, Ha-Leem Kim, Qixin Feng, Ruichen Xia, Dishan Abeysinghe, Jingxu Xie, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Dung-Hai Lee, Feng Wang</p>
            <p>In clean two-dimensional (2D) systems, electrons are expected to self-organize into a regular lattice, a Wigner crystal, when their mutual Coulomb repulsion overwhelms kinetic energy. Understanding the Wigner crystal at zero magnetic field is a long-sought goal in physics, thanks to its fundamental simplicity and possible connection to the density-driven metal-insulator transition. To date, evidence for such a crystal has been reported across various platforms. However, the AC conductivity of a zero-field Wigner crystal, a key observable characterizing its electrodynamics, has never been measured. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive on-chip terahertz (THz) spectroscopy technique to probe the AC conductivity in electrostatically gated monolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observe a sub-THz resonance corresponding to the pinning mode of a zero-field Wigner crystal, whose frequency is orders of magnitude higher than those under high magnetic fields. Using the pinning mode as an indicator, we reveal that moderate disorder notably stabilizes the Wigner crystal. With increasing density towards melting, we find that the pinning mode of the Wigner crystal coexists with a growing Drude component characteristic of an electron liquid, and the competition between these two components in the conductivity spectra leads to the insulator-metal transition of the 2D electron system. Our findings not only elucidate the low-energy electrodynamics of a zero-field Wigner crystal, but also establish on-chip THz spectroscopy as a powerful probe for correlated quantum phases in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Anomalous Thermal Hall Effect in a Kagome Superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroki Yoshida, Hikaru Takeda, Jian Yan, Yui Kanemori, Brenden R. Ortiz, Yuzki M. Oey, Stephen D. Wilson, Marcin Konczykowski, Kota Ishihara, Takasada Shibauchi, Minoru Yamashita</p>
            <p>Broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in superconductors can induce not only spontaneous magnetization by the finite angular momentum of Cooper pairs, but also anomalous thermal Hall effects (ATHEs), whose detection has been extremely challenging. Here we report the successful observation of an ATHE developing below the superconducting transition temperature at zero magnetic field in the kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5. This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Remarkably, both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE, but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity. Our study of ATHE offers an alternative approach to probe TRS breaking in the superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>Design and Optimization of Spin Dynamics in Ge Quantum Dots: g-Factor Modulation, Dephasing Sweet Spots, and Phonon-Induced Relaxation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngoc Duong, Daryoosh Vashaee</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schrödinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Direct Observation of the Lindhard Continuum using Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</h2>

            <p>Understanding the excitations of quantum materials is essential for unraveling how their microscopic constituents interact. Among these, particle-hole excitations form a particularly important class, as they govern fundamental processes such as screening, dissipation, and transport. In metals, the continuum of electron-hole excitations is described by the Lindhard function. Although central to the theory of Fermi liquids, the corresponding Lindhard continuum has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report its direct observation in the weakly correlated metal MgB$_{2}$ using ultra-soft resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve a linearly dispersing excitation with velocity comparable to the Fermi velocity and find quantitative agreement with simulations of the non-interacting charge susceptibility. A detailed analysis and decomposition of the simulations reveal the intra-band origin of this low-energy excitation, confirming it as the Lindhard continuum. Our results establish ultra-soft RIXS as a momentum-resolved probe of the fermiology in metals and call for deeper investigations of continuum features in RIXS and related spectroscopy of other materials beyond MgB$_{2}$.</p>

            <h2>An Orbit-qubit Quantum Processor of Ultracold Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Gen He, Wei-Yong Zhang, Zhen-Sheng Yuan, Jian-Wei Pan</p>
            <p>It is challenging to build scalable quantum processors capable of both parallel control and local operation. As a promising platform to overcome this challenge, optical lattices offer exceptional parallelism. However, it has been struggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice spacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit encoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve spatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this processor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using minimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish orbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture, opening new pathways for quantum computation applications.</p>

            <h2>Measuring pulse heating in Si quantum dots with individual two-level fluctuators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyang Ye, Lokendra S. Dhami, John M. Nichol</p>
            <p>To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown. Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating.</p>

            <h2>Carrier Density Dependence of Superconducting Transition Temperature in Electron-doped $\rm{SrTiO_3}$ Based on the First-principles Calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Ikaida, Kazuhiro Sano, Yoshimi Masuda, Takuya Sekikawa, Yoshiaki Ōno</p>
            <p>Electron-doped strontium titanate $\rm{SrTiO_3}$, known to be one of the most dilute superconductors, is investigated on the basis of the first-principles calculations. When the carrier density n decreases, the frequencies of the ferroelectric optical phonons near the $\Gamma$-point monotonically decreases in the overdoped regime with $n<10^{20}/\rm{cm}^{3}$, while unphysical imaginary phonon frequencies due to ferroelectric instabilities appear in the underdoped regime with $n>10^{20}/\rm{cm}^{3}$. We estimate the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm{c}}$ by using the McMillan equation in the overdoped regime and find that $T_{\rm{c}}$ increases with decreasing n as consistent with experiments in the overdoped regime. Detailed analysis of the Eliashberg function reveals that the increases in $T_{\rm{c}}$ with decreasing n in the overdoped regime is mainly due to the contributions from the ferroelectric soft-mode optical phonons.</p>

            <h2>Correlated interlayer quantum Hall state in alternating twisted trilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dohun Kim, Gyeoul Lee, Nicolas Leconte, Seyoung Jin, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jeil Jung, Gil Young Cho, Youngwook Kim</p>
            <p>Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</p>

            <h2>Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waquar Ahmed, Steffen Schaeffer, Pierre Lombardo, Roland Hayn, Imam Makhfudz</p>
            <p>Electrons of $d$-symmetry in a kagome lattice are considered which interact with non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The non-collinearity of spin texture gives rise to non-relativistic spin splitting and the associated intrinsic Berry curvature. The integral of the latter over the Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial for non-coplanar (canted) non-collinear spin order even without explicit on-site or transfer spin-orbit coupling. That gives rise to a nonzero (scalar) spin chirality, and a record value for the Chern number of $C=\pm 5$ can appear when the Fermi level is in an appropriate gap for isotropic electron hopping integrals, or nearly isotropic ones. The numerical results for this topological quantum anomalous Hall effect are supported by an analytical formula. It is possible to split the $C=\pm 5$ plateau into different possible nonzero values for the Chern number by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transitions between Hall plateaus can be driven by flipping the Zeeman-like exchange field or controlling the onsite energies, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Structure and Activity in Nanocatalysts via Machine Learning and Global Structure Representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofia Zinzani, Francesca Baletto, Kevin Rossi</p>
            <p>Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.</p>

            <h2>Topological excitonic insulators in electron bilayers modulated by twisted hBN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Zeng, Allan H. MacDonald, Nemin Wei</p>
            <p>Equilibrium interlayer exciton condensation is common in bilayer quantum Hall systems and is characterized by spontaneous phase coherence between isolated layers. It has been predicted that similar physics can occur in the absence of a magnetic field in some two-dimensional semiconductor bilayers. In this work we consider the case of two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers separated by a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer or multilayer. The hBN layers suppress tunneling between the TMD layers so that phase coherence is spontaneous when it is present. When twisted, the hBN layers also form a ferroelectric moiré pattern that applies opposite triangular-lattice modulation potentials to the two TMD layers. We show via mean-field theory that at total hole filling per moiré unit cell $\nu=1$, this geometry can favor a chiral p-wave exciton condensate state in which the quantum anomalous Hall effect coexists with counter-flow superfluidity. We present a mean-field phase diagram for TMD hole bilayers modulated by twisted hBN, discuss the conditions needed for the realization of the p-wave condensate state, and propose experiments that could confirm its presence.</p>

            <h2>Synergetic Enhancement of Power Factors and Suppression of Lattice Thermal Conductivities via Biaxial Strain in ScAgSe$_2$ and TmAgTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wu Xiong, Zhongjuan Han, Zhonghao Xia, Zhilong Yang, Jiangang He</p>
            <p>The challenge of achieving high thermoelectric (TE) performance is mainly from the entanglement among Seebeck coefficient ($S$), electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$). In this work, we propose a synergetic strategy of enhancing power factor (PF, $S^2\sigma$) and suppressing $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ by applying a biaxial tensile strain in two silver chalcogenides ScAgSe$_2$ and TmAgTe$_2$ with TlCdS$_2$-type structure. The forbidden $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the $\Gamma$ point and allowed $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the A point and the middle of $\Lambda$ line leads to high electronic band dispersion along the $\Gamma$-A direction and a high-degeneracy valence band valley ($\Lambda_2$). The elongation of the Ag-Se bond under tensile strain weakens the orbital coupling between Ag-$d$ and Se/Te-$p$ orbitals and reduces the band energy at the A point, which aligns the valence band and achieving a high band degeneracy. Concurrently, the weaker Ag-Se/Ag-Te bond under a small tensile strain leads to lower phonon group velocity and strong three- and four phonon scatterings, leading to lower $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$. Our first-principles calculations combined with electron-phonon coupling analysis as well as phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equations show that applying a 3\% (2\%) tensile strain can enhance the PF along the $c$-axis of ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) by 243\% (246\%) at a carrier concentration of 3$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ and reduce the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ by 37\% (26\%) at 300 K. Consequently, 2 $\sim$ 4 times of $ZT$ enhancement is obtained by 3\% or 1\% tensile strain in ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) at 300 K, achieving a maximum $ZT$ of 3.10 (3.62) at 800 K. Our material design strategy based on molecular orbital analysis reveals an effective route to boosting TE performance, and can be extended to other systems as well.</p>

            <h2>Antiferromagnetic ordering and critical behavior induced giant magnetocaloric effect in distorted kagome lattice Gd$_3$BWO$_9$</h2>

            <p>We synthesize the high-quality Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ single crystal and investigate its lowtemperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties. Below $T\rm_{N}$ = 1.08 K, the anisotropic behavior of magnetic susceptibilities reveals that the Gd$^{3+}$ moments exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic coupling along the $c$-axis, while displaying a ferromagnetic arrangement in kagome plane. With pronounced magnetic frustration, in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration experiments starting from initial conditions of 9 T and 2 K, Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ polycrystal reaches a minimum temperature of 0.151 K, significantly lower than its $T\rm_{N}$. Due to the high density of Gd$^{3+}$ ions ($S$=7/2), the maximum magnetic entropy change reaches over 50 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ under fields up to 7 T in Gd$_3$BWO$_9$, nearly 1.5 times as large as commercial sub-Kelvin magnetic coolant Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$(GGG). The H-T phase diagram of Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ under $H$//$c$ exhibits field-induced critical behavior near the phase boundaries. This observation aligns with the theoretical scenario in which a quantum critical point acts as the endpoint of a line of classical second-order phase transitions. Such behavior suggests the importance of further investigations into the divergence of magnetic Grüneisen parameter in the vicinity of critical field at ultralow temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Transitions in Trapped Superfluids Excited by Alternating Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova</p>
            <p>The paper presents a survey of some dynamical transitions in nonequilibrium trapped Bose-condensed systems subject to the action of alternating fields. Nonequilibrium states of trapped systems can be realized in two ways, resonant and nonresonant. Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are generated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to resonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system of trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the Josephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or more parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers, but the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent modes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect. The mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal Josephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich dynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion. Under Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to phase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown to be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in superfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong nonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states comprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet turbulence, and wave turbulence. Nonequilibrium states can be characterized and distinguished by effective temperature, effective Fresnel number, and dynamic scaling laws.</p>

            <p>We show that characteristics of the electron's form factor in two-dimensional materials are observable in quasiparticle interference (QPI) spectrum. We study QPI in twisted bilayer graphene using real-space tight-binding calculations combined with the kernel polynomial method, which agrees excellently with the form factor norm obtained from the continuum Hamiltonian. The QPI signals, displaying a chiral structure, reveal all distinct interference processes between states near the Dirac points. We propose pseudospin textures of twisted bilayer graphene to explain all the interference mechanisms. Our results provide microscopic insights into electronic eigenstates of twisted bilayer graphene and suggest QPI as a potential method for probing the form factor, which governs the material's quantum geometry and many-body states.</p>

            <p>Impurities and intrinsic point defects, which profoundly influence spin, charge, and topological degrees of freedom, are crucial parameters for tuning quantum states in quantum materials. The magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with its strong spin-orbit coupling, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and kagome lattice of correlated electrons, provides a compelling platform for studying impurity excited states. Yet, the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping its quantum states remains elusive. Here, we uncover intrinsic quantum clusters-localized intrinsic point defects that act as tunable quantum perturbations capable of reshaping electronic states and order parameters, on the surface of Co3Sn2S2 via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non contact atomic force microscopy, combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy. These clusters are identified as native oxygen defects that dominate the intrinsic defect landscape on both cleaved surface terminations. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupy hollow sites between three Sn atoms, and tune the flat band near the Fermi level, which exhibits orbital magnetism induced unconventional Zeeman effect under an applied magnetic field. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials reside slightly off center relative to the S lattice and generate occupied impurity states that retain sixfold symmetry at higher energies but reduce to C2 symmetry at lower energies. In contrast, these impurity states show no measurable magnetic response. Our findings establish that intrinsic oxygen-related quantum clusters act as tunable local perturbations in a topological kagome magnet, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer impurity-driven phenomena in correlated and topological systems.</p>

            <h2>Achieving DFT accuracy in short range ordering and stacking fault energy using moment tensor potential for CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mashroor S. Nitol, Artur Tamm, Subah Mubassira, Shuozhi Xu, Saryu J. Fensin</p>
            <p>Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) such as CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi are promising structural materials owing to their outstanding mechanical and thermal properties, which arise from complex chemical disorder and atomic-scale interactions. Although density functional theory (DFT) has provided fundamental insights into these systems, its high computational cost limits exploration of large-scale phenomena. Classical interatomic potentials have been used to address this gap but often lack the fidelity needed to capture many-body interactions and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) effects. In this work, we developed a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to bridge accuracy and efficiency. The MTP was trained on a comprehensive DFT database spanning unary to quaternary configurations and reproduces energies, forces, and stresses with near-DFT accuracy across diverse structural and chemical environments. It accurately predicts elastic properties and recovers compositional trends in bulk and shear moduli in agreement with DFT. Hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations capture CSRO, reproducing key DFT-reported features including Cr-Cr and Fe-Fe repulsion and Ni-Cr ordering. Stacking fault energetics were modeled, yielding ISF energies near 54 mJ/m2 for CoCrNi and 36 mJ/m2 for CoCrFeNi, consistent with DFT predictions. Local chemical environment effects on stacking faults were also resolved: Co-rich planes reduce, whereas Cr- or Fe-rich planes increase, the stacking fault energy. By enabling large-scale, high-fidelity simulations at a fraction of DFT's cost, the developed MTP provides a robust framework for predictive modeling of thermodynamic stability, defect behavior, and mechanical response of FCC MEAs.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth (RE) based frustrated magnets have attracted great attention as excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at sub-Kelvin temperatures, while the experimental identification on systems exhibiting both large volumetric cooling capacity and reduced working temperatures far below 1 K remain to be a challenge. Here, through the ultra-low temperature magnetism and thermodynamic characterizations, we unveil the large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) realized at sub-Kelvin temperatures in the frustrated Kagome antiferromagnet Gd3BWO9 with TN~1.0 K. The isothermal magnetization curves indicate the existence of field (B) induced anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams, where four distinct magnetic phases for B // c-axis and five magnetic phases for B // ab-plane are identified at T< TN. The analysis of magnetic entropy S(B, T) data and direct adiabatic demagnetization tests reveal a remarkable cooling performance at sub-Kelvin temperatures featured by a large volumetric entropy density 502.2 mJ/K/cm3 and a low attainable minimal temperature Tmin~168 mK from the initial cooling condition of 2 K and 6 T, surpassing most of Gd-based refrigerants previously documented in temperature ranges of 0.25-4 K. The realized Tmin~168 mK far below TN ~ 1.0 K in Gd3BWO9 is related to the combined effects of magnetic frustration and criticality-enhanced MCE, which together leave a substantial magnetic entropy at reduced temperatures by enhancing spin fluctuations.</p>

In a weak coupling regime ($x/\epsilon_F\ll 1$) presence of an additional energy scale $\propto m q_c\delta q$ gives rise to several regimes with distinct spectrum and transport properties: in a regime with small order parameter $x\lessapprox m p_F \delta q$ Fermi arcs show up and substantially change conductance. At larger values of the order parameter Fermi arcs are gapped out. Regimes are also distinguished by different effective exponents $\gamma$ in conductance correction $\sigma\propto \tau_D^\gamma$ where $\tau_D$ is scattering time off disorder and $1\leq\gamma\leq 2$.</p>

            <h2>Mean first-passage time of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pascal Grange, Linglong Yuan</p>
            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations. The Laplace transforms of these equations induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and the mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ tend to infinity to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing optimal transport: Role of final distributions in finite-time thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Tojo, Rihito Nagase, Ken Funo, Takahiro Sagawa</p>
            <p>Performing thermodynamic tasks within finite time while minimizing thermodynamic costs is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. Here, we develop a unified framework for optimizing the thermodynamic cost of performing various tasks in finite time for overdamped Langevin systems. Conventional optimization of thermodynamic cost based on optimal transport theory leaves room for varying the final distributions according to the intended task, enabling further optimization. Taking advantage of this freedom, we use Lagrange multipliers to derive the optimal final distribution that minimizes the thermodynamic cost. Our framework applies to a wide range of thermodynamic tasks, including particle transport, thermal squeezing, and information processing such as information erasure, measurement, and feedback. Our results are expected to provide design principles for information-processing devices and thermodynamic machines that operate at high speed with low energetic costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md. Mostaqul Islam, Ahmed Zubair</p>
            <p>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using 2D nanomaterials has emerged as a sophisticated approach to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions. In this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe, Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency, and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants. Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and sustainable energy ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Quantum Hall systems host quasiparticles demonstrating correlated electron physics and non-trivial quantum statistics. Excitonic phases, archetypical for interaction effect, have attracted significant interest in recent years in double-layer quantum Hall systems where spatially separated electrons and holes form bosonic condensate through Coulomb interaction. Here, employing the approach of quantum Hall antidot with two spatially separated edge channels, we demonstrate a new type of quantum Hall quasiparticle exciton which represents a quantum-coherent bound state of an electron and a hole situated on their corresponding edges coupled through intralayer tunneling and Coulomb interaction. Quantum-coherent dynamics of the exciton is reflected in the observed evolution of the position and magnitude of the antidot conductance peaks around the electron-hole resonance. The quantum Hall antidot setup allows localization and electrical tuning of individual quantum Hall excitons. Quantum superposition of vacuum- and electron-hole pairing states is observed through the gate-dependent tunneling conductance of the antidot. Modeling the electron-hole pair as a coupled two-level system, semi-quantitative understanding of experimental observations is achieved. This work opens avenues for creating quantum systems of multiple quantum Hall quasiparticles.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal constitutive laws for oriented active solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balázs Németh, Takuya Kobayashi, Ronojoy Adhikari</p>
            <p>We present an overdamped continuum description of oriented active solids in which interactions respect the symmetries of space but do not obey the principle of action and reaction. Taking position and orientation as kinematic variables, we examine the conservation of the linear and angular momentum variables in an elementary volume. We find that nonreciprocal interactions yield, in addition to the areal stresses and moment stresses of classical elasticity, volumetric forces and torques that act as local sources of momentum and angular momentum. Since, by symmetry, these can only depend on the strains, nonreciprocity requires the extension of constitutive modeling to strain-dependent volumetric forces and torques. Using Cartan's method of moving frames and Curie's principle, we derive the materially linear constitutive law that underpins the nonreciprocal, geometrically nonlinear elasticity of the continuum. We study this constitutive law exhaustively for a one-dimensional active solid and identify striking nonreciprocal effects - traveling waves, linear instabilities, spontaneous motion of and about the center of mass - that are absent in a passive, reciprocally interacting solid. Numerical simulations of a particulate active solid model, consisting of a linear assembly of hydrodynamically interacting active particles, yields long-wavelength behavior that is in excellent agreement with theory. Our study provides the foundation for a principled macroscopic mechanics of oriented active solids with symmetry-invariant, nonreciprocal microscopic interactions.</p>

            <p>Labyrinthine stripe patterns are common in many physical systems, yet their lack of long-range order makes quantitative characterization challenging. We investigate the evolution of such patterns in bismuth-doped yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG) films subjected to a magnetic field annealing protocol. A U-Net deep learning model, trained with synthetic degradations including additive white Gaussian and Simplex noise, enables robust segmentation of experimental magneto-optical images despite noise and occlusions. Building on this segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the transition from the "quenched" state to a more parallel and coherent "annealed" state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing complex labyrinthine systems.</p>

            <p>Hyperfine interactions couple nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. The present work explores how hyperfine coupling within the Tm ions in TmVO$_4$ single crystals affects an electronic ferroquadrupole ordered ground state and its associated field-tuned quantum phase transition. For temperatures below the hyperfine energy scale, the nuclear moments reduce the critical field for the electronic order, resulting in a dramatic back-bending of the phase boundary delineating the ferroquadrupole order. This behavior is well described by a single-ion semiclassical mean-field model. Moreover, analysis of the effective Hamiltonian leads to a prediction of spontaneous nuclear magnetic order mediated by 4$f$ electrons, which in principle persists with the application of orthogonal antisymmetric strain, yielding a proposed electro-nuclear tetracritical point.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond enables the characterization of magnetic properties in the extreme situation of tiny sample with defects. Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta.

            <p>Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces is essential for unraveling surface reactivilty and designing advanced catalytic materials. Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces.</p>

            <p>Stochastic resetting is a powerful strategy known to accelerate the first-passage time statistics of stochastic processes. While its effects on Markovian systems are well understood, a general framework for non-Markovian dynamics is still lacking, mostly due to its mathematical complexity. Here, we present an analytical and numerical framework to study non-Markovian processes under resetting, focusing on the first-passage properties of escape kinetics from metastable states. We show that resetting disrupts the inherent time correlation, inducing Markovianity, thereby leading to an efficient escape mechanism. This work, therefore, provides a much needed theoretical approach for incorporating resetting into complex chemical and biological processes, which follow non-Markovian dynamics.</p>

            <p>Nanofluidic memristors promise brain-inspired information processing with ions, yet their microscopic origin remains debated. So far, ionic memory has been attributed to ion-specific interactions, dynamic wetting, chemical reactions or mechanical deformations, yet typically without direct evidence. Here, by combining operando interferometric imaging with electrokinetic measurements, we directly visualize voltage-induced blistering of the confining walls of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, as key origin of memristive hysteresis. We identify two distinct classes of blisters: unidirectional, driven by electrostatic forces on surface charges, and bidirectional, arising from osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization. This mechanistic framework explains device evolution and device-to-device variability, and reframes stochastic blistering as a functional design element. Our results constitute a direct proof of electromechanical coupling as a robust pathway to ionic memory in 2D nanochannels and open routes toward high-performance ionic memristors and electrically actuated nanofluidic valves.</p>

Moreover, the AC excitation effectively mitigates low-frequency 1/f noise down to sub-microvolt per sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz. Systematic investigations have been performed to optimize the NiFe thickness while keeping the Pt thickness at 2 nm.

            <p>The magnetic and crystal structures of manganese and nickel monoxides have been studied by high-resolution neutron diffraction. The known 1$k$-structures based on the single propagation vector $\left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right]$ for the parent paramagnetic space group $Fm\bar{3}m$ are forced to have monoclinic magnetic symmetry and are not possible in rhombohedral symmetry. However, the monoclinic distortions from the rhombohedral $R\bar{3}m$ metric allowed by symmetry are very small, and the explicit monoclinic splittings of the diffraction peaks have not been experimentally observed. We analyze the magnetic crystallographic models metrically compatible with our experimental data in full detail by using the isotropy subgroup representation approach, including rhombohedral solutions based on the propagation vector star $\left\{ \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right],\ \left[-\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right],\ \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ -\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right],\ \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ -\tfrac{1}{2}\right] \right\}$. Although the full star rhombohedral $R\bar{3}c$ structure can equally well fit our diffraction data for NiO, we conclude that the best solution for the crystal and magnetic structures for NiO and MnO is the 1$k$-monoclinic model with the magnetic space group $C_c2/c$ (BNS 15.90, UNI symbol $C2/c.1'_c[C2/m]$).</p>

High-quality crystals were characterized by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Laue diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and Raman spectroscopy. Manipulation of magnetic properties through nonmagnetic Zn doping was shown in NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Our results enable the detailed investigation and manipulation of their unconventional altermagnetic and multiferroic properties.

            <h2>Generic continuum model formalism for moiré superlattice systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Xie, Jianqi Huang, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>The moiré superlattice system provides an excellent platform for exploring various novel quantum phenomena. To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated and topological states emerging from moiré superlattices, one usually adopts an effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron effects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate continuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moiré superlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in principle applicable for arbitrary moiré superlattices and are extrapolatable to any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic properties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain invariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external inputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the coupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition enables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model using a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we design a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density functional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer MoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately reproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures, charge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist angles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles. Our work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic properties of moiré superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future theoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moiré superlattice systems.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) governs nonlinear electrical responses in systems with a spectral line gap. The quantum metric, which is a component of the QGT and takes complex values in non-Hermitian systems, generates an intrinsic nonlinear conductivity independent of the scattering time, while the complex Berry curvature induces a wavepacket-width-dependent response. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics and the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport phenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width significantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian systems. This framework unifies non-Hermitian response theory by revealing how geometric degrees of freedom encode transport in open and synthetic quantum matter. Our results bridge fundamental quantum geometry with emergent functionality, offering pathways to exploit geometric effects in topological devices and engineered materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ground-state phases and spin-scissors dynamics of binary Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a twisted two-dimensional harmonic trap. The ground state hosts three distinct phases-phase-separated, polarized, and phase-mixed-determined by the Rabi coupling, interaction ratio G (between inter-component and intra-component interactions), and spin-twisting which induces edge-localized polarization through position-dependent detuning. In the phase-mixed regime, the ground state is characterized by a finite spin-scissors susceptibility and can be accurately described using local density approximation. In the dynamics, the system exhibits stable periodic beating in the phase-mixed state for G<1. For G>1, its evolution progresses from beat damping (phase-separated state) to polarized relaxation (polarized state), finally reaching stable periodic beating (phase-mixed state) after a finite waiting time. The dependence of the waiting time contrasts sharply with the monotonic behavior of one-dimensional spin-dipole dynamics, revealing qualitatively distinct mechanisms governed by geometry and interactions. In summary, these results establish a unified link between ground-state properties and nonequilibrium responses in twisted spinor condensates, offering a versatile platform for exploring spin-related quantum many-body phenomena.</p>

This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria.

While a contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.</p>

            <p>Machine learning (ML) has become a commonplace approach in the development of interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, and its use also for radiation effect modelling is increasing. In this work, we investigate the effects of training ML potentials to density functional theory data calculated with different pseudopotentials in nickel. We look in detail at the differences that appear in radiation damage simulations. The use of a "harder" pseudopotential with semicore electrons has a direct impact on the short-range interactions, which in turn has implications on the radiation damage simulations. We find that despite these differences, the average threshold displacement energy is quite similar (40-50 eV for Ni). However, we find significant differences in the cumulative damage predicted by massively overlapping cascade simulations and compare them with Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy/channeling experiments. We also investigate approaches to modify the repulsive pair interactions after training the potentials and discuss the feasibility of such approaches.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric nematic fluids are promising materials for tunable nonlinear photonics, with applications ranging from second harmonic generation to sources of entangled photons. However, the few reported values of second-order susceptibilities vary widely depending on the molecular architecture. Here, we systematically measure second-order NLO susceptibilities of five different materials that exhibit the ferroelectric nematic phase, as well as the more recently discovered layered smectic A ferroelectric phase. The materials investigated include archetypal molecular architectures as well as mixtures showing room-temperature ferroelectric phases. The measured values, which range from 0.3 to 20 pm/V, are here reasonably predicted by combining calculations of molecular-level hyperpolarizabilities and a simple nematic potential, highlighting the opportunities of modelling-assisted design for enhanced NLO ferroelectric fluids.</p>

            <h2>Descriptor and Graph-based Molecular Representations in Prediction of Copolymer Properties Using Machine Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elaheh Kazemi-Khasragh, Rocío Mercado, Carlos Gonzalez, Maciej Haranczyk</p>
            <p>Copolymers are highly versatile materials with a vast range of possible chemical compositions. By using computational methods for property prediction, the design of copolymers can be accelerated, allowing for the prioritization of candidates with favorable properties. In this study, we utilized two distinct representations of molecular ensembles to predict the seven different physical polymer properties copolymers using machine learning: we used a random forest (RF) model to predict polymer properties from molecular descriptors, and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the same properties from 2D polymer graphs under both a single- and multi-task setting. To train and evaluate the models, we constructed a data set from molecular dynamic simulations for 140 binary copolymers with varying monomer compositions and configurations. Our results demonstrate that descriptors-based RFs excel at predicting density and specific heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) and volume (Cv) because these properties are strongly tied to specific molecular features captured by molecular descriptors. In contrast, graph representations better predict expansion coefficients ({\gamma}, {\alpha}) and bulk modulus (K), which depend more on complex structural interactions better captured by graph-based models. This study underscores the importance of choosing appropriate representations for predicting molecular properties. Our findings demonstrate how machine learning models can expedite copolymer discovery with learnable structure- property relationships, streamlining polymer design and advancing the development of high-performance materials for diverse applications.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of Chiral Phonons in MnPS$_3$ from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Banhi Chatterjee, Peter Kratzer</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials may host circular phonons, considered as chiral if the presence of a substrate breaks mirror symmetry. In 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, phonons with a given chirality can be observed in the non-equilibrium state triggered by optical excitations using circularly polarized light. Backed by first-principles calculations, we present the antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$ with a hexagonal crystal structure and bandstructure similar to TMDCs, but a larger unit cell, as a novel candidate material that may allow for excitation of circular phonons. Using DFT+U and the finite displacement method we obtain in-plane chiral phonon modes at the valley points of a monolayer MnPS$_3$. These modes can be classified according to the Mn or S atoms performing circular motions about their equilibrium positions. In each case, the quantized angular momentum of the phonons is calculated. Moreover, we point out ways to populate the chiral phonons selectively via optical excitation with circularly polarized light.</p>

            <p>With advances in informatics applied to materials science, predicting the physical properties of numerous materials has become increasingly feasible, creating a growing demand for their experimental validation. It has been expected that the integration of robotic systems into experimental materials science excels at efficiently performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks without the need for human intervention, thus significantly increasing throughput and reducing the risk of human error, while there have been a limited number of reports tackled the synthesis process of solid bulk material so far possibly because of the complex as well as a wide variety of processes to deal with. In this paper, we report an automated arc melting system controlled by a robot operating system2 (ROS2). Taking advantage of ROS2, we have constructed a machine that can handle multiple experimental apparatuses simultaneously with flexibility for future expansion of functions. The constructed machine is capable of not only performing repeated operation of a specific process but also dealing with multiple elements for synthesis of intermetallic compounds. The system is expected to accelerate experimental validation of data-driven materials exploration.</p>

            <h2>A shortcut through the macroscopic fluctuation theory: a generalised Fick law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Théotim Berlioz, Olivier Bénichou, Aurélien Grabsch</p>
            <p>The macroscopic fluctuation theory is a powerful tool to characterise the large scale dynamical properties of diffusive systems, both in- and out-of-equilibrium. It relies on an action formalism in which, at large scales, the dynamics is fully determined by the minimum of the action. Within this formalism, the analysis of the statistical properties of a given observable reduces to solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with the appropriate boundary conditions. One must then compute the action at its minimum to deduce the cumulant generating function of the observable. This typically involves computing multiple integrals of cumbersome expressions. Recently, a simple formula has been conjectured to shortcut this last step, and compute the cumulant generating function of different observables (integrated current or position of a tracer) without the need to compute any integral. In this work, we prove this simple formula, and extend it to more general observables. We then illustrate the efficiency of this approach by applying it to compute the variance of a generalised current in the semi-infinite symmetric exclusion process and the joint properties of two occupation times in any diffusive system. In the case of the integrated current, our formula can be interpreted as a generalisation of Fick's law to obtain all the cumulants of the current beyond the average value.</p>

            <p>In this work, we examine low-energy adsorption configurations of four dodecanuclear manganese single-molecule magnets [Mn$_{12}$O$_{12}$(O$_2$CR)$_{16}$(H$_2$O)$_4$] (Mn$_{12}$), where the ligand R being H, CH$_3$, CHCl$_2$ or C$_6$H$_5$, on a molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) monolayer using force field and density functional theory calculations. The van der Waals interaction is shown to be crucial for determining the adsorption energy. Some electrons transfer from the substrate to the molecules upon surface adsorption, resulting in a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$. Since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Mn$_{12}$ is close to the valence band of MoS$_2$, a negative electric field is more effective in modulating charge transfer and energy band alignment, and thus altering the magnetic anisotropy energy, compared with a positive electric field. A significant increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$ with the ligand R=CHCl$_2$ or R=C$_6$H$_5$ under a sufficiently high electric field has been predicted. Our calculations show that the molecules remain intact on the surface both before and after the electric field is applied. Finally, a two-level system formed by different adsorption configurations is evaluated, and the tunability of its energy barrier under an electric field is demonstrated. Our study sheds light on tuning the properties of single-molecule magnets using an electric field, when the molecules are supported on a surface.</p>

            <p>High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is an important method for imaging beam sensitive materials often under cryo conditions. Electron ptychography in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has been shown to reconstruct low-noise phase data at a reduced fluence for such materials. This raises the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique. Even though the transfer function is a common metric for evaluating the performance of an imaging method, it only describes the signal transfer with respect to spatial frequency, irrespective of the noise transfer. It can also not well defined for methods, such as ptychography, that use an algorithm to form the final image. Here we apply the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence independent and sample independent measure of technique performance. We find that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but that ptychography is more robust to partial coherence.</p>

We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.</p>

            <p>We propose an asymmetric-nanoconstriction (ANC) design of spin-Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) and investigate mutual synchronization of a pair of such devices using micromagnetic simulations. The ANC geometry enables strong dipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current bias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a single ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a field-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We then demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via dipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on the bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0°) or out-of-phase (180°) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude correlation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase and out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance drives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the weaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent frequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route toward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and experimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics.</p>

            <p>Many-body interactions strongly influence the structure, stability, and dynamics of condensed-matter systems, from atomic lattices to interacting quasi-particles such as superconducting vortices. Here, we investigate theoretically the pairwise and many-body interaction terms among skyrmions in helimagnets, considering both the ferromagnetic and conical spin backgrounds. Using micromagnetic simulations, we separate the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and Zeeman contributions to the skyrmion-skyrmion pair potential, and show that the binding energy of skyrmions within the conical phase depends strongly on the film thickness. For small skyrmion clusters in the conical phase, three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to the cohesive energy, comparable to that of pairwise terms, while four-body terms become relevant only at small magnetic fields. As the system approaches the ferromagnetic phase, these higher-order contributions vanish, and the interactions become essentially pairwise. Our results indicate that realistic models of skyrmion interactions in helimagnets in the conical phase must incorporate many-body terms to accurately capture the behavior of skyrmion crystals and guide strategies for controlling skyrmion phases and dynamics.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debika Debnath, Arijit Saha, Paramita Dutta</p>
            <p>The recent advent of a new class of magnetic material named as altermagnet (AM), characterized by a combination of momentum-dependent spin-splitting with zero net magnetization, has opened up promising prospects for spintronic applications. We theoretically explore how the altermagnetic spin-splitting affects the thermoelectric quasiparticle current in AM-based superconducting heterostructures. Our setup comprises of a bilayer system where a $d$-wave AM is proximity coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor (SC). We calculate the thermoelectric current carried by the quasiparticles applying a finite thermal bias accross the junction. The behavior of the thermoelectric current with the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to that in traditional SC heterostructures. Remarkably, the dissipative thermoelectric current found in the AM junction is spin-split and thus generates finite spin-polarization in the AM-based junction, which can approach $100\%$ spin-polarization in the strong altermagnetic phase. We further investigate the thermoelectric current in AM-based Josephson junction (JJ) and illustrate how to achieve the diode effect in this AM-based JJ. The efficiency of our proposed thermoelectric diode reaches upto $\sim 80\%$ and changes its sign depending on the strength of the AM, enhancing the potential for spin-calotronics applications.</p>

We collect text data in the case study of Flitzing, a tradition of emailing poem-like romantic invitations at Dartmouth College because of its richness in information. Across the three approaches, we obtain consistency in phase transition and clustering results, which also align with literature on the mathematics of transformers and metastability.

            <p>To study the mechanical behavior of mock high explosives, an experimental and simulation program was developed to calibrate, with quantified uncertainty, a material model of the bonded granular material Idoxuridine and nitroplasticized Estane-5703. This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models, showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool.</p>

            <p>We propose a field-theoretic framework for ideal hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids formulated in terms of a complex scalar field defined on a spacelike hypersurface comoving with the fluid. In the normal phase, the dynamics of charge-carrying fluids is constrained by the restrictive chemical shift symmetry, which locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane as they are transported through space by the fluid's motion. On the other hand, in the superfluid phase, the chemical shift symmetry is relaxed to a constant shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely across the comoving hypersurface. We demonstrate that both models recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations and provide explicit expressions for the collective variables of hydrodynamics in terms of the theory's fields. Introduced models provide a UV completion to the effective field theories of hydrodynamics constructed in terms of the Goldstone fields. Finally, we propose a relativistic fracton fluid phase as a natural interpolation between the normal and superfluid phases, in which the mobility of elementary charges is constrained by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space.</p>

            <p>Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</p>

            <h2>Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesse Gardner, Vladimir A. Baulin</p>
            <p>The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangyang Du</p>
            <p>Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.</p>

            <h2>Erasing Classical Memory with Quantum Fluctuations: Shannon Information Entropy of Reverse Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Cristiano Nisoli</p>
            <p>Quantum annealers can provide non-local optimization by tunneling between states in a process that ideally eliminates memory of the initial configuration. We study the crossover between memory loss and retention due to quantum fluctuations, in a transverse Ising model on odd numbered antiferromagnetic rings of thousands of spins with periodic boundary conditions, by performing reverse quantum annealing experiments on three programmable superconducting flux qubit quantum annealers. After initializing the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic domain wall distributions. We demonstrate a clear crossover in memory retention, and its dependence on hardware platform and simulation time. Our approach establishes a general probe of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and memory.</p>

            <p>We study the geometric phase accumulated during non-adiabatic charging of different driven open quantum systems serving as quantum battery models. We provide a full numerical analysis of dy- namics under different type of noises typically reported in superconducting circuits implementations. We complement the study with analytic results derived in the limiting case of no noise (i.e. isolated systems). We compute the non-unitary geometric phase acquired by the quantum batteries during the transition and show that there is a direct relation between the accumulated geometric phase and the integral of the stored energy during the transition. Finally, we perform the same analysis on a bipartite quantum battery that relies on a dephased charger and found similar results. Our theoretical findings are within experimental reach using state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonghao Weng, Liqiang Gao, Linwu Zhu, Jian Huang</p>
            <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

            <h2>The phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang-Wei Li, Yuan-Heng Tseng, Fu-Jiun Jiang</p>
            <p>We study the phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice using the non-perturbative first principle Monte Carlo simulations. Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest couplings, respectively. In particular, the values of $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8,$ and 1.0 are considered in our study. Based on the numerical outcomes, we find that the phase transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23,$ and 0.24 are second order and are governed by the 2D Ising universality class. In addition, we find evidence to support the facts that there are transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8$ and 1.0 and these phase transitions are second order. Our results also indicate phase transition is unlikely to take place for $g=0.3$. We are not able to obtain results for $J_2/|J_1|$ $\in$ (0.24, 0.3) because the associated integrated autocorrelation times or (and) the equilibrium times are extremely large at the low-temperature region. A comparison between the outcomes presented here and the available results in the literature is briefly conducted as well.</p>

            <h2>Quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations with U(1) gauge fields: Application to the Aharonov-Bohm ring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeonseok Yang, Shoki Koyanagi, Yoshitaka Tanimura</p>
            <p>We investigate a three-dimensional subsystem under a time-dependent U(1) gauge field coupled to rotationally invariant environments. To capture the dynamic behavior of the subsystem under thermal excitations and dissipations, it is imperative to treat the bath in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative manner. This is because quantum noise is constrained by the uncertainty principle, which dictates the relationship between the noise correlation time and the amplitude of the energy fluctuation. To this end, we derive the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) incorporating the gauge field, enabling a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of the reduced subsystem. Transforming the HEOM into the Wigner representation yields quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations [U(1)-QHFPE] with U(1) gauge fields. These equations incorporate vector fields into the damping operators while preserving both gauge invariance and rotational symmetry. To demonstrate the practical use of the formalism, the effects of a heat bath in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring. Our investigation includes simulations of the equilibrium distribution, linear absorption spectra, and AB currents under thermal conditions. Within a rotationally invariant system-bath (RISB) model, we predict the emergence of a persistent current even in dissipative environments, provided the bath is non-Markovian and the temperature is sufficiently low. We also assessed the validity of the Caldeira-Leggett model in this context.</p>

            <p>Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diyath Pannipitiya, Roland Roeder</p>
            <p>Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two. These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by Müller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</p>

            <h2>Emergent order from mixed chaos at low temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Chvykov, Jeremy England</p>
            <p>This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Cheng, Zhiwei Yu, Mengqi Wang, Lingfeng Yang, Zihao Cui, Ya Wang, Pengfei Wang</p>
            <p>Scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electrometry has shown potential for quantitative quantum imaging of electric fields at the nanoscale. However, achieving nanoscale spatial resolution remains a challenge since employing gradiometry to overcome electrostatic screening causes resolution-limiting trade-offs including the averaging effect and the sensor-sample proximity. Here, we demonstrate a scanning NV center protocol that achieves an enhanced spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm. We develop an axially symmetric probe with a sub-nanometer oscillating amplitude, which simultaneously provides robust intermittent-contact mode feedback and ensures close engagement between the diamond tip and the sample. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a 10 nm spatial resolution on ferroelectric lithium niobate. Scanning NV center electrometry with this resolution can directly resolve the nanoscale polar textures and dynamics of emerging ferroelectrics, which commonly arise on the scale of tens of nanometers.</p>

            <p>Erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) emitters are relevant for optical applications due to their narrow emission line directly in the telecom C-band due to the ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{13/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{15/2}}$ transition at 1.54 $\mu$m. Additionally they are promising candidates for future quantum technologies when embedded in thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to achieve fabrication scalability and CMOS compatibility. In this paper we integrate $\text{Er}^{3+}$ emitters in SOI metasurfaces made of closely spaced array of nanodisks, to study their spontaneous emission via room and cryogenic temperature confocal microscopy, off-resonance and in-resonance photoluminescence excitation at room temperature and time resolved spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the possibility to adopt CMOS-compatible and fabrication scalable metasurfaces for controlling and improving the collection efficiency of the spontaneous emission from the $\text{Er}^{3+}$ transition in SOI and could be adopted in similar technologically advanced materials.</p>

We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</p>

            <p>Neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) have transformed atomistic simulations, by enabling molecular dynamics simulations with near ab initio accuracy at reduced computational costs and improved scalability. Despite these advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.</p>

Here, we demonstrate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave (CW) entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures. We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.</p>

            <p>The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states. We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</p>

            <p>Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moiré potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moiré-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moiré potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moiré-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serves as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.</p>

            <p>Electrically tunable linear dichroism (LD) with non-volatile properties represents a critical yet elusive feature for next-generation integrated photonic elements in practical device architectures. Here, we demonstrate record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2, selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the "up" polarization state while leaving the "down" state unperturbed. This ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure.</p>

Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p>

In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for Rényi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling Rényi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatically driven dissipative many-body quantum spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paulo J. Paulino, Stefan Teufel, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>We explore the evolution of a strongly interacting dissipative quantum Ising spin chain that is driven by a slowly varying time-dependent transverse field. This system possesses an extensive number of instantaneous (adiabatic) stationary states which are coupled through non-adiabatic transitions. We analytically calculate the generator of the ensuing slow dynamics and analyze the creation of coherences through non-adiabatic processes. For a certain choice of the transverse field shape, we show that the system solely undergoes transitions among classical basis states after each pulse. The concatenation of many of such pulses leads to an evolution of the spin chain under a many-body dynamics that features kinetic constraints. Our setting not only allows for a quantitative investigation of adiabatic theorems and non-adiabatic corrections in a many-body scenario. It also directly connects to many-body systems in the focus of current research, such as ensembles of interacting Rydberg atoms which are resonantly excited by a slowly varying laser pulse and subject to dephasing noise.</p>

            <h2>The power spectrum of compressible turbulence: A story in symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olivier Coquand</p>
            <p>This article presents a theoretical study of the scaling properties of the kinetic energy spectrum in compressible turbulence. From the fundamental symmetries and linear trans- formations of the microscopic action, we derive exact relations between the correlation functions and their generators. These relations put strong constraints on the possible scaling relations in the system as a function of scale. One of the main results of this study is that the action can be split between an incompressible part, which is the same as in the usual stochastic Navier-Stokes theory whatever the value of the Mach number, and a longitudinal part, whose behavior is to be compared to the three dimensional Burgers equation, which presents a much richer phase diagram as its usually discussed one dimensionalcounterpart.</p>

            <p>Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.</p>

            <p>We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</p>

            <p>The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</p>

            <p>We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk this http URL results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments indicate that crystalline graphene multilayers exhibit much of the richness of their twisted counterparts, including cascades of symmetry-broken states and unconventional superconductivity. Interfacing Bernal bilayer graphene with a WSe$_2$ monolayer was shown to dramatically enhance superconductivity -- suggesting that proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in promoting Cooper pairing. Motivated by this observation, we study the phase diagram of spin-orbit-coupled rhombohedral trilayer graphene via self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations, elucidating the interplay between displacement field effects, long-range Coulomb repulsion, short-range (Hund's) interactions, and substrate-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. In addition to generalized Stoner ferromagnets, we find various flavors of intervalley coherent ground states distinguished by their transformation properties under electronic time reversal, $\text{C}_3$ rotations, and an effective anti-unitary symmetry. We pay particular attention to broken-symmetry phases that yield Fermi surfaces compatible with zero-momentum Cooper pairing, identifying promising candidate orders that may support spin-orbit-enhanced superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.</p>

We estimate duration of these temporary nonlocal phenomena and inspect their possible manifestation in the quench-driven processes. Such dynamical effects might play an important role in braiding protocols of the topological and/or conventional superconducting quantum bits using nanoscopic hybrid structures.</p>

Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling obstruction: A local and symmetry-preserving discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a \textit{local} Lagrangian for a helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum Monte Carlo simulations that preserve the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bishnu Karki, Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure characterized by flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena, such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and an augmented tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations indicate that spin-orbit coupling in LK-99 generates multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level, thereby enhancing the Berry curvature distribution by further splitting the bands. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. The nonlinear Hall effect is solely due to the BCD, as the contributions from the Drude weight and quantum metric are zero due to time reversal symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_2$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also suggest similarities to other candidate odd-parity superconductors.</p>

            <p>Nanopatterned magnetic thin films offer a platform for exploration of tailored magnetic properties such as emergent long-range order. A prominent example is artificial spin ice (ASI), where an arrangement of nanoscale magnetic elements, acting as macrospins, interact via their dipolar fields. In this study, we discuss the transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) long-range order in a square lattice ASI, as the magnetic elements are gradually rotated through 45° to a "pinwheel" configuration. The AFM$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition is observed experimentally using synchrotron radiation x-ray spectromicroscopy and occurs for a certain rotation angle of the nanomagnets, dependent on the dipolar coupling strength determined by the separation of the magnets in the lattice. Large-scale magnetic dipole simulations show that the point-dipole approximation fails to capture the correct AFM$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition angle. However, excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained using a dumbbell-dipole model which better reflects the actual dipolar fields of the magnets. This model also explains the coupling dependence of the transition angle, another feature not captured by the point-dipole model. Our findings resolve a discrepancy between measurement and theory in previous work on "pinwheel" ASIs and establish the coupling dependence of the AFM-FM transition. The revised dipole model, with a more accurate representation of the stray field, offers more precise control of magnetic order in artificial spin systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum free electrons, i.e. plane waves, with wavevector k, and occupancy constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle, are explained in all solid state physics texts. Although overly simplified, free-electron theory works surprisingly well for many properties of simple metals. For bulk materials, it is assumed that the sample is effectively infinite and that surfaces are irrelevant. Over the past 30 years, experiments that visualize surfaces and enable the study of 2-d materials have revolutionized solid state physics, stimulating new experiment, theory, and applications. Modified free electron models, adapted to films, have enabled modeling of electronic properties of films. This paper analyzes three such models: periodic boundary conditions, hard-wall boundary conditions, and soft- wall (SW) boundary conditions, in order of increasing realism. The SW case is illustrated for an aluminum film consisting of six atomic layers, comparing SW free-electron theory with a scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiment.</p>

            <p>We employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ion and water transport driven by an electric field through quasi-two-dimensional nanoslits with a tapered geometry. Despite the absence of surface charge on the channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe a robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. Additionally, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. However, in uncharged tapered nanoslits, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M. Long, Dominic V. Else</p>
            <p>Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</p>

This sign discrepancy originates from the dipole-like charge distribution appearing in the quadratic response.

            <p>Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</p>

            <p>Detecting the faint signal of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) stands as a major frontier in gravitational-wave astronomy, pushing the need for detectors whose sensitivity exceeds the standard quantum limit (SQL). Here, we propose an orbital optomechanical (OOM) sensor that exploits the sensitive coupling of an orbitally squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate to spacetime distortions, enabling the detection of interferometer phase shifts induced by CWs. This sensor achieves a theoretical quantum-noise-limited sensitivity 16 dB below the SQL while reducing the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. The performance arises from a novel noise trade-off: a counter-propagating readout scheme suppresses photonic shot noise, while orbital squeezing minimizes the remaining atomic projection noise. By leveraging quantum control over atomic orbital degrees of freedom, this approach establishes a new framework for interferometric sensing with direct applications to the search for CWs and ultralight dark matter.</p>

This allows us to estimate for the first time the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, coexistence phase, and disordered phase. Based on these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition.

            <p>Stripe order is a prominent feature in the phase diagram of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors. It has been confirmed as the lowest-energy state of the two-dimensional Fermi Hubbard model in certain parameter regimes. Upon increasing the temperature, stripes and the superconducting state give way to the enigmatic strange-metal and pseudogap regimes, whose precise nature remains a long-standing puzzle. Using modern tensor network techniques, we discover a crucial aspect of these regimes. Infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) simulations in the fully two-dimensional limit reveal a maximum in the charge susceptibility at temperatures above the stripe order. This maximum is located around filling $n=0.9$ and intensifies upon cooling. Using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) on finite cylinders, we attribute the enhanced charge susceptibility to the formation of charge clusters, reminiscent of phase separation where the system is partitioned into hole-rich and hole-depleted regions. In contrast to genuine phase separation, the charge cluster sizes fluctuate without a divergent charge susceptibility. Hence, while this precursor state features clustering of charge carriers, true phase separation is ultimately forestalled at lower temperatures by the onset of stripe order.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional spin-up ideal Fermi gas interacting attractively with a spin-down impurity in the continuum undergoes, at zero temperature, a first-order phase transition from a polaron to a dimeron state. Here we study a similar system on a square lattice, by considering the attractive 2D Fermi-Hubbard model with a single spin-down and a finite filling fraction of spin-up fermions. We study polaron and dimeron quasi-particle properties via variational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation. Moreover, we develop a determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm for this problem based on expansion in bare on-site coupling $U$. This algorithm turns out to be sign-problem free at any filling of spin-up fermions, allowing one to sample very high diagram order (larger than $200$ in our study) and to do simulations for large $U/t$ (we go up to $U/t=-20$ with $t$ the hopping strength). Both methods give qualitatively consistent results. With variational Ansatz we go to even larger on-site attraction. In contrast with the continuum case, we do not observe any polaron-to-dimeron transition for a range of spin-up filling fractions $\rho_{\uparrow}$ between $0.1$ and $0.4$. % (away from the low-filling limit). The polaron state always gives a lower energy and has a finite quasi-particle residue.</p>

            <p>Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. Here, we give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. In particular, using a cavity approach, we analyze three high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. Furthermore, for perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naive method.</p>

            <p>The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Leiner, David Holec</p>
            <p>The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates advancements in hydrogen storage technologies. This study investigates the hydrogen adsorption characteristics of graphene and a (8,0) carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with adatoms of various elements. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the universal interatomic potential 'PreFerred Potential' (PFP) implemented in the Matlantis framework, we explore the hydrogen storage capabilities of these doped carbon structures at 77K. We analyze the adsorption efficiency based on the position of adatoms (top, bridge, and hollow sites) and find that the group II elements, such as calcium and strontium, exhibit significant hydrogen uptake. Additionally, light elements like lithium and sodium demonstrate enhanced gravimetric hydrogen storage due to their low atomic mass. Our findings provide insights into the potential of doped graphene and CNTs for efficient hydrogen storage applications.</p>

            <h2>Bond-Network Entropy Governs Heat Transport in Coordination-Disordered Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamil Iwanowski, Gábor Csányi, Michele Simoncelli</p>
            <p>Understanding how the vibrational and thermal properties of solids are influenced by atomistic structural disorder is of fundamental scientific interest, and paramount to designing materials for next-generation energy technologies. While several studies indicate that structural disorder strongly influences the thermal conductivity, the fundamental physics governing the disorder-conductivity relation remains elusive. Here we show that order-of-magnitude, disorder-induced variations of conductivity in network solids can be predicted from a bond-network entropy, an atomistic structural descriptor that quantifies heterogeneity in the topology of the atomic-bond network. We employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport to demonstrate the existence of a relation between the bond-network entropy, and observables such as smoothness of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and macroscopic conductivity. We also show that the smoothing of the VDOS encodes information about the thermal resistance induced by disorder, and can be directly related to phenomenological models for phonon-disorder scattering based on the semiclassical Peierls-Boltzmann equation. Our findings rationalize the conductivity variations of disordered carbon polymorphs ranging from nanoporous electrodes to defective graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.</p>

            <h2>Analog of the Carnot engine for fluctuating diffusivity in living cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuichi Itto</p>
            <p>Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Tunneling between Two-Dimensional Electron Layers Driven by Spin Pumping: Adiabatic Regime and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Modi Ke, Mahmoud M. Asmar, Wang-Kong Tse</p>
            <p>Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.</p>

We study whether ALLs can lead to Fermi-surface like quantum oscillation in the absence of a zero-field Fermi surface. Focusing on two-dimensional multi-band low-energy models of electrons with continuous rotation symmetry, we show that an effective-band description, akin to the semiclassical treatment of Landau level problems in metals, can be used to predict the Landau level spectrum, including possible ALLs. This description then describes ALL induced quantum oscillation for certain insulating models, which we demonstrate through numerical calculations.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of a weak link which is defined in an InAs-Al (core-half shell) nanowire and embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy that revealed pair transitions and single-quasiparticle transitions arising from spin-orbit split Andreev bound states. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which facilitates large coupling in the system. For the pair transitions, the experimentally observed energy level splitting demonstrates the coupling to an Andreev level of 490 MHz. We apply a perturbative model that shows good agreement with the experimental data and extract the maximum coupling of 968~MHz. Moreover, we show that the coupling is even stronger to an Andreev level with a higher transmission. In addition, spectroscopy of single-quasiparticle transitions reveals spin-orbit split Andreev bound states with the extracted spin-photon coupling of 77 MHz.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effects of interfacial spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) on superconductors, focusing on its impact on electronic transport and spin-charge conversion. Using a symmetry-based nonlinear sigma model, we derive effective boundary conditions for the Usadel and Maxwell equations that account for the spin-galvanic effect, spin relaxation, and spin precession. This approach allows for the analysis of various interfaces without relying on specific microscopic models. We apply these boundary conditions to derive ISOC-induced terms in the Ginzburg-Landau functional, which is then used to compute the critical temperature of superconducting films with ISOC subjected to an external magnetic field. Our findings show that, contrary to a recent prediction, the critical temperature of a film cannot be enhanced by an external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate that the combination of ISOC and an external magnetic field leads to a superconducting diode effect. Its efficiency strongly depends on the interplay between the spin-galvanic and the spin relaxation terms. Our results provide a framework for understanding ISOC in superconducting systems and highlight the potential for optimizing diode efficiency through careful interface engineering.</p>

            <p>Quantum tunneling experiments have provided deep insights into basic excitations occurring as Green's function poles in the realm of complex quantum matter. However, strongly correlated quantum materials also allow for Green's functions zeros (GFZ) that may be seen as an antidote to the familiar poles, and have so far largely eluded direct experimental study. Here, we propose and investigate theoretically how co-tunneling through Mott insulators enables direct access to the shadow band structure of GFZ. In particular, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the GFZ that is shown to govern the co-tunneling amplitude and reveal fingerprints of many-body correlations clearly distinguishing the GFZ structure from the underlying free Bloch band structure of the system. Our perturbative analytical results are corroborated by numerical data both in the framework of exact diagonalization and matrix product state simulations for a one-dimensional model system consisting of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model coupled to two single level quantum dots.</p>

            <p>In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to study the symmetry breaking in the charge-density wave (CDW) phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\text{x}}$Sn$_\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid density functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional density functional theory (DFT) and Hubbard-corrected DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <p>Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</p>

By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way.

We demonstrate amorphous CrTe3 thin films that display practically no resistance drift at any working temperature from -200 to 165 degree C. We achieve multilevel programming of CrTe3 through both step-wise crystallization and step-wise amorphization using a hybrid opto-electronic device at various temperatures. Moreover, the application potential of CrTe3 in neuromorphic computing is testified by its incorporation in a vehicle with automatic path-tracking function.

            <p>We introduce the rare-earth delafossite compound TlYbSe2 - extending the search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated triangular lattice magnets. While the DC magnetisation suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several Kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetisation and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a quantum-disordered ground state. We observe a spin glass transition around ~30 mK at zero field, arguably originating from a small fraction of free spins--with an associated entropy of <3 % of the total Rln2, which is suppressed by an applied field of ~0.02 T. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K is indicative of short-range spin correlations. Below 350 mK, we observe a robust linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, accompanied by the complete absence of long-range order at low fields. We propose that a phenomenological theory, based on the interplay between spinons and thermally excited gauge flux excitations, can account for the linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, and could be widely applicable to similar critical quantum spin liquid candidate materials. The results establish the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime candidate for field-tunable triangular quantum spin liquid behavior and highlight the importance of thermally excited gauge field excitations.</p>

            <p>We have discovered specific conditions for generic scattering systems to act as wave splitters that are robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Li, Xiao-Han Yang, Xiao-Yu Dong</p>
            <p>The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.</p>

            <p>We study the first-passage dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the particle drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we calculate the leading order asymptotics of the time-dependent distribution of the particle position, derive the most probable paths that reach the specified position at a given time and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean first-passage time, and show that the feedback accelerates dynamics by storing finite-time fluctuations, thereby lowering the effective energy barrier and shifting the optimal first-passage time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate the dynamics. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control first-passage dynamics.</p>

Through simultaneous fits to the dispersions including data in polarizing field along the Ising axis, we obtain an excellent match to an Ising-like XXZ Hamiltonian and rule out previously proposed Kitaev exchanges. In the intermediate-field phase below $B_{C}$, we observe three dispersive modes, out of which only the lowest energy one is sharp and the others are broad and overlap with continuum scattering. We propose that the broadening effects are due to magnon decays into two-magnon excitations and confirm that such processes are kinematically allowed. The continuum scattering becomes progressively stronger upon lowering field and, at 0.25 T and zero field, it dominates the complete spectrum with no clear evidence for even broadened magnon modes. We discuss the relevance of the continuous manifold of mean-field degenerate ground states of the refined Hamiltonian for capturing the observed spectrum in zero field, and compare the data with the one- and two-magnon spectrum averaged over this manifold. We also propose a model of the interlayer couplings to explain the observed finite interlayer magnetic propagation vector of the zero-field magnetic order; this requires the breaking of the mirror symmetry in the nominal P-3m1 space group and through refinement of x-ray diffraction data on an untwinned single crystal, we indeed confirm a rotation of the CoO6 octahedra around the c-axis, which lowers the symmetry to P-3.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongmeng Yang, Xingyue Yang, Jianhua Wang, Qiang Li, Rui Peng, Ching Hua Lee, Lay Kee Ang, Jing Lu, Yee Sin Ang, Shibo Fang</p>
            <p>In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches forming a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomenon is explained by a double-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O and V2Te2O/ZnSe/V2Te2O AMTJs. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</p>

            <p>The development of reversible hydrogen storage materials has become crucial for enabling carbon-neutral energy systems. Based on this, the present work investigates the hydrogen storage on the sodium-decorated P-C$_3$N (Na@P-C$_3$N), a porous carbon nitride monolayer recently proposed as a stable semiconductor. First-principles calculations reveal that Na atoms preferentially adsorb with an adsorption energy of -4.48~eV, effectively suppressing clusterization effects. Upon decoration, the system becomes metallic, while \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of Na@P-C$_3$N at 300~K. Hydrogen adsorption on Na@P-C$_3$N occurs through weak physisorption, with energies ranging from -0.18 to -0.28~eV, and desorption temperatures between 231 and 357~K. The system can stably absorb 16 H$_2$ molecules per unit cell, corresponding to a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.88~wt\%, surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy target. These results demonstrate that Na@P-C$_3$N is a promising candidate for lightweight, stable, and reversible hydrogen storage.</p>

            <h2>Axionic $p + is$ superconductivity from two pairing channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitê Kessler de Azambuja, David Möckli</p>
            <p>In unconventional superconductors, inversion and/or time-reversal symmetries may be broken, either extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts an axionic superconducting state, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.</p>

            <p>This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a physical neuromorphic network device can be feasibly optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giniyat Khaliullin, Jiří Chaloupka</p>
            <p>We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.</p>

We construct the corresponding singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Ryuichi Shindou</p>
            <p>Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</p>

            <p>Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under the uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models to compare the resulting phase diagrams: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. We show that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing the phase-modulated superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring this exotic superconductivity without external magnetic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic properties of time-delayed dynamics remain largely unexplored, especially for systems that exhibit asymptotically non-stationary behavior. Here, we investigate heat dissipation in two classes of marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin dynamics: (i) diffusive criticality, which asymptotically manifests as scaled Brownian diffusion, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, which shows oscillation with diffusive amplitude. By analytical derivations, we find fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: the average heat dissipation rate asymptotically approaches a constant for diffusive criticality but diverges linearly with oscillations for oscillatory criticality, despite both showing linearly growing variance over time. We further numerically study the probability distributions of heat dissipation rates for both types of critical dynamics. Our results demonstrate that non-stationary time-delayed dynamics with similar scaling can yield qualitatively distinct heat dissipation behaviors, depending on the underlying dynamical details. This work provides a concrete foundation for future investigations into thermodynamic properties of general nonlinear time-delayed systems.</p>

            <p>This review focuses on the force-induced unzipping transition of double-stranded DNA. It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.</p>

            <p>Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</p>

            <p>Exciton transport is fundamental for understanding transport phenomena in bosonic systems and for exploring excitation energy transfer in materials. Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in separated layers. Long IX lifetimes allow them to form quantum bosonic states and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport kinetics in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved imaging of IX cloud expansion. We found efficient IX transport. Describing this transport as diffusive gives anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. The IX transport kinetics shows that this efficient IX transport is long-range ballistic transport.</p>

            <p>We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals that their design and optimization should prioritize molecular properties governing the information ratchet mechanism, rather than those influencing energetic bias.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cecile Monthus</p>
            <p>The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues.</p>

The ARPES spectra reveal the coexistence of a sharp hole band with a light electron mass and a broad electron band with a relatively heavy electron mass, which originate from different quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) chains in Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$. Moreover, the electron band around the Brillouin-zone (BZ) boundary shows a replica structure with respect to the energy originating from plasmonic polarons due to electron-plasmon interactions. The different scattering effects and interactions in each atomic chain lead to asymmetric transport lifetimes of carriers: a large Seebeck coefficient can be realized even in a semimetal. Our findings pave the way for exploring the thermoelectric materials in previously overlooked semimetals and provide a new platform for low-temperature thermoelectric physics, which has been challenging with semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally regarded as mutually exclusive: superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic fields, whereas the quantum Hall effect relies on them. Here we report a striking exception, where an unconventional superconducting phase is stabilized by an out-of-plane magnetic field and coexists with a re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) effect in moiré-less rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. The re-entrant quantum Hall state, arising from a bubble-like charge density wave (CDW), provides a natural backdrop for the emergence of superconductivity. Angle-resolved transport reveals that the field-stabilized superconducting phase occupies the same density--displacement-field regime as a stripe-ordered phase at zero field, yet only develops once the stripe is replaced by a bubble-like CDW at finite field. These findings demonstrate a decisive role of CDW order in stabilizing superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, establishing a new paradigm for the interplay between superconductivity and quantum Hall physics.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017 {\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.</p>

We overcome this limitation with a dynamic control strategy that accesses any configuration in a single global drive cycle by leveraging the system's sensitivity to the drive and its time derivatives. We realize this strategy with bistable beams on a rotating platform, where drive cycles become orbits in a control space of angular velocity and acceleration. State changes occur when these orbits cross switching thresholds, which we rationally design so that each state can be accessed by a single drive orbit. We construct a five-bit system and demonstrate its full addressability by selecting drive orbits that write all 26 uppercase letters of the alphabet in ASCII representation. This dynamic control paradigm offers a general route towards smart, remotely operated devices across various physical domains.</p>

            <p>Doppler Broadening (DB) of annihilation radiation is a well-established technique within Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS), used for probing the electronic structure of materials. The analysis of DB experimental data relies on gamma spectroscopy analysis tools, while depth profiling using variable-energy slow positron beams depends on solving the positron diffusion equation. Traditional Variable Energy Doppler Broadening (VEDB) analysis tools, such as VEPFIT and ROYPROF, often present limitations due to outdated interfaces and lack of integration with comprehensive spectroscopy analysis platforms. Addressing these challenges, an open-source Python package for PAS analysis, PyPAS, is introduced.

            <h2>Nonlinear opto-magnetic signature of d-wave altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lijun Yang, Long Liang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered collinear magnetic order with net zero magnetization but exhibits spin-splitting band structure, has attracted much research interest due to the rich fundamental physics and possible applications. In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the Néel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.</p>

            <p>In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \times 10^{\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications.</p>

            <h2>Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Zhang, Mengqi Wang, Tiantian Zhang</p>
            <p>Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results show the phonon splitting of the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes have distinct origins: the $E_g$ splitting arises from MBC and is captured by our algorithm, while the $E_u$ splitting stems from correlation-sensitive Fano resonance, explaining their asymmetric experimental line shapes. We provide a design strategy and computational pathway for materials with large phonon magnetism and splitting, requiring SOC, electron-phonon coupling, and ideally flat bands at the Fermi level. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tien-Cuong Dinh, Subhroshekhar Ghosh, Hoang-Son Tran, Manh-Hung Tran</p>
            <p>We establish asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations for functionals of a large class of spin models and strongly correlated random point fields, achieving near-optimal rates. For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jyong-Hao Chen, Vadim Cheianov</p>
            <p>We investigate why, in quantum many-body systems, the adiabatic fidelity and the overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states often yield nearly identical values. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon results from an interplay between two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the limit of small evolution parameters and the limit of large system sizes. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a straightforward explanation. In the latter case, a key insight is that pairs of vectors in the Hilbert space orthogonal to the initial state tend to become nearly orthogonal as the system size increases. We illustrate these general findings with two representative models of driven many-body systems: the driven Rice-Mele model and the driven interacting Kitaev chain model.</p>

            <p>Universality and scaling laws are hallmarks of equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena. However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Bowen Yang, Joseph T. Iosue, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Quantum low-density parity-check codes, such as the Kitaev toric code and bivariate bicycle codes, are often defined with periodic boundary conditions, which are difficult to realize in physical systems. In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing all gapped boundaries and defects of two-dimensional Pauli stabilizer codes. Using the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data, such as anyon fusion rules and topological spins, of two-dimensional bulk stabilizer codes and one-dimensional boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits for both prime and nonprime $d$, enabling exploration of topological phases beyond the Kitaev toric code. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. Finally, we study the boundaries of bivariate bicycle codes, showing that they exhibit large logical dimensions and anyons with long translation periods.</p>

            <p>We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.</p>

It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Power Laws for the Thermal Slip Length of a Liquid/Solid Interface From the Structure and Frequency Response of the Contact Zone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroki Kaifu, Sandra M. Troian</p>
            <p>Today's powerful integrated chips for information processing, computer graphics and visualization generate so much heat that liquid based cooling is now indispensable to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway effects. While thermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the intrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by the thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for estimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but no comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures. Researchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But despite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study of 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at different temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior throughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone, the data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power law relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of the first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the maxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid layer. We hope that this perspective, which highlights the critical role of surface localized phonons in L/S systems, can now better guide development of analytic models and de novo interface designs for minimizing thermal slip.</p>

            <p>The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.</p>

            <p>Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi Fang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, in previous studies, only the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems has been considered, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced by Shapourian et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 165101 (2017)], it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound.</p>

Using the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate that the multiphoton JCHM exhibits quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI) phase, the superfluid phase, and an additional phase we refer to as the forbidden phase. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed.</p>

            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.</p>

            <p>Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</p>

            <p>We investigate Perfect Absorption (PA) of radiation, in which incoming energy is entirely dissipated, in a system consisting of molecular spin centers coherently coupled to a planar microwave resonator operated at milliKelvin temperature and in the single photon regime. This platform allows us to fine tune the spin-photon coupling and to control the effective dissipation of the two subsystems towards the environment, thus giving us the opportunity to span over a wide space of parameters. Our system can be effectively described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibiting distinct Hermitian subspaces. We experimentally show that these subspaces, linked to the presence of PA, can be engineered through the resonator-spin detuning, which controls the composition of the polaritons in terms of photon and spin content. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered even in the absence of PT-symmetry. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how our results can be potentially exploited for applications, in particular as single-photon switches and modulators.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</p>

            <p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field. Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ansätze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit, with GPU hardware providing us with significant speedups over CPU hardware. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.</p>

Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</p>

Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilya Pavlyukevich, Olga Aryasova, Alexei Chechkin, Oleksii Kulyk</p>
            <p>We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed Lévy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions. In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions. This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of Lévy flights in steep potential landscapes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Ippoliti, David M. Long</p>
            <p>We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.</p>

            <p>Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results complement recent analysis in the literature and show that the total magic of a state is unable to detect topological phases, indicating either that a different property is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Kubo</p>
            <p>This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</p>

            <p>A key bottleneck to solar fuels is the absence of stable and strongly absorbing photoelectrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Modern approaches generally trade off between stable but weakly absorbing materials, such as wide bandgap oxides, or strongly absorbing materials that rely on encapsulation for stability and are weakly catalytic, such as the III-V family of semiconductors. Of interest are materials like transition metal phosphides, such as FeP$_2$, that are known to undergo beneficial in situ surface transformations in the oxidative environment of OER, though stability has remained a primary hurdle. Here we report on CaCd$_2$P$_2$, a Zintl phase visible-light absorber with favorable 1.6 eV bandgap, that we identified using high-throughput computational screening. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical measurements, microscopy, and spectroscopy, we show that CaCd$_2$P$_2$ undergoes a light-stabilized surface transformation that renders it stable under alkaline OER conditions. We also show that the well known OER catalyst CoPi can act as a stable co-catalyst in synergy with the \textit{in-situ} CaCd$_2$P$_2$ surface. The light-induced stabilization that CaCd$_2$P$_2$ displays is in sharp contrast to the photocorrosion commonly observed in visible light-absorbing photoelectrodes. The broader AM$_2$P$_2$ family of Zintl phases offers a significant opportunity to explore stabilizing interface chemistry and re-design the manner in which low-bandgap semiconductors are used for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.</p>

            <p>In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects, vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials, which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saran Vijayan, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</p>

            <p>Quantum Hall Fabry-Pérot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of bulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference phase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the Coulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of the bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and exit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the interferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer graphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with the entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the dependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the equilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our multi-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of quasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the second is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect site that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.</p>

            <p>Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2 (0 <= x <= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side, whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and their interplay.</p>

            <p>The interplay between unconventional superconductivity and altermagnetic order has attracted much attentions. In particular, whether spin-triplet superconductivity can be achieved by suppressing altermagnetism remains an open issue. We investigate this issue using a minimal single-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice with vacancy superstructure, in which both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic order can emerge on equal footing. We illustrate the existence of a metallic normal phase with altermagnetism even at half-filling due to the geometric frustration and Coulomb interaction. Suppressing the altermagnetic long-range order using charge doping can lead to both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spin fluctuation. The spin-singlet pairing is always favored when the conventional antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation dominates. However, when the altermagnetic spin fluctuation dominates, spin-triplet pairing may be induced. Implications of our results in possible material candidates are also briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and Néel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.</p>

            <p>Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition, resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior, revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics, solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues for material design.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate field-induced switching of magnetic topology in a nanodisk-shaped sample of noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnet in which the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that stabilizes an antiskyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=+1 and the magnetic dipole interaction that stabilizes a skyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$ are in keen competition where $N_{\rm sk}$ is the skyrmion number. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the competition offers a unique opportunity to switch magnetic textures with distinct magnetic topology among the antiskyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=+1), elliptical skyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$), and nontopological bubble ($N_{\rm sk}$=0) in a deterministic manner by application of magnetic fields parallel to the sample plane. By calculating time and spatial profiles of energy contributions from respective interactions and magnetic anisotropy, we clarify the physical mechanism and properties of the observed field-induced topology switching phenomena.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Naimer, Paulo E. Faria Junior, Klaus Zollner, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids with long-range entanglement are of great interest for applications in quantum technology. The quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is a promising example, where it is believed that structural disorder plays a key role in enhancing quantum mechanical effects by introducing strains that split the ground state doublet akin to the effect of a local disordered transverse field. However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is unknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by density functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$ sites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies, and the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our results explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic singlets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure. These singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field excitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are magnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a significant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the magnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum effects.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$) and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance for spintronic and sensing applications.</p>

            <p>The van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr exhibits coupling of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom, giving rise to distinctive quasi-particle interactions. We investigate these interactions across a wide temperature range using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy at various excitation energies, complemented by optical absorption and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. Under 1.96 eV excitation, we observe pronounced changes in the A$_g^1$, A$_g^2$, and A$_g^3$ Raman modes near the Néel temperature, coinciding with modifications in the oscillator strength of excitonic transitions and clear resonances in PLE. The distinct temperature evolution of Raman tensor elements and polarization anisotropy for Raman modes indicates that they couple to different excitonic and electronic states. The suppression of the excitonic state's oscillation strength above the Néel temperature could be related to the magnetic phase transition, thereby connecting these excitonic states and Raman modes to a specific spin alignment. These observations make CrSBr a versatile platform for probing quasi-particle interactions in low-dimensional magnets and provide insights for applications in quantum sensing and quantum communication.</p>

            <p>Anyons are particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, their exchange statistics can be measured in the edge-state Fabry-Pérot interferometer. In these devices, the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp}\theta_a$ to the interference signal. Here we report the observation of large, hysteretic phase jumps in a monolayer graphene Fabry-Pérot interferometer at $\nu=1/3$. When the filling factor is increased from $\nu<1/3$ towards the center of the plateau, we observe phase slips with magnitude $\Delta \theta \approx 2\pi/3$, consistent with the addition of individual quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, the phase slips occur as instantaneous jumps in the interference signal, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes. We use this long timescale to investigate the effect of changes in interferometer area $A_I$ and $N_{QP}$ independently at fixed magnetic field, revealing a striking memory effect in the phase slip magnitude. In particular, as the $\nu=1/3$ plateau is approached from higher filling, we observed phase slips with $\Delta \theta$ significantly larger than $2\pi/3$ over the same range of gate voltage where quantized jumps are seen for increasing $\nu$. We discuss this asymmetry in terms of bulk-edge coupling of quasiparticles localized near the edge or in the bulk, and argue that this effect can be qualitatively reconciled with theoretical expectations for strongly interacting quasiparticles in the presence of weak disorder and strongly nonequilibrium charge dynamics. Our results highlight the key role played by charge dynamics on signatures of the anyon phase, and demonstrate that fractional quasiparticles can be indefinitely localized in nonequilibrium configurations.</p>

            <h2>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijie Mo, Xiao-Jiao Wang, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Azam Zoshki, Ralph Kenna, Nerses Ananikian</p>
            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovic Gardré, Swen Helstroffer, Pierre Muller, Fabrice Thalmann, Thierry Charitat, Laurent Joly, Claire Loison</p>
            <p>Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity upon dehydration, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics. Finally, the increase of the area per lipid in our tension-free simulations of the fluid membranes hints that the permittivity decrease upon dehydration is concomitant with an intermembrane attraction.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Anisotropy and Absence of Long-Range Order in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</h2>

            <p>The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.</p>

            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive platform for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. We accomplish this by employing established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</p>

            <h2>Demystifying quantum escapism on the honeycomb lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. L. Chernyshev</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Emanant and emergent symmetry-topological-order from low-energy spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Jessie Chen, Ömer M. Aksoy, Cenke Xu, Xiao-Gang Wen</p>
            <p>Low-energy emergent and emanant symmetries can be anomalous, higher-group, or non-invertible. Such symmetries are systematically captured by topological orders in one higher dimension, known as symmetry topological orders (symTOs). Consequently, identifying the emergent or emanant symmetry of a system is not simply a matter of determining its group structure, but rather of computing the corresponding symTO. In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of 1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary conditions with all possible symmetry twists. Applying this approach, we show that the gapless antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model possesses an exact emanant symTO corresponding to the $D_8$ quantum double, when restricted to the $\mathbb{Z}_2^x \times \mathbb{Z}_2^z$ subgroup of the $SO(3)$ spin-rotation symmetry and lattice translations. Moreover, the AF phase exhibits an emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, whose exact components are described jointly by the symTO and the $SO(3)$ spin-rotations. Using condensable algebras in symTO, we further identify several neighboring phases accessible by modifying interactions among low-energy excitations: (1) a gapped dimer phase, connected to the AF phase via an $SO(4)$ rotation, (2) a commensurate collinear ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with a $\omega \sim k^2$ mode, (3) an incommensurate, translation-symmetric ferromagnetic phase featuring both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes, connected to the previous phase by an $SO(4)$ rotation, and (4) an incommensurate ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Roberto Verdel, Jean-Yves Desaules, Maksym Serbyn, Marko Ljubotina, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>Kinetic constraints are generally expected to slow down dynamics in many-body systems, obstructing or even completely suppressing transport of conserved charges. Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding constrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon integrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories are exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of kinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly constrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is superdiffusive over a broad parameter regime. Even more drastically, spin transport exhibits ballistic behavior, albeit with anomalous finite-volume properties as a consequence of gauge invariance. Our findings are relevant to current efforts in quantum simulations of gauge-theory dynamics and anomalous hydrodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) is an emergent platform for exploring exotic quantum phases driven by the interplay between nontrivial band topology and strong electron correlations. Direct experimental access to its momentum-resolved electronic structure is essential for uncovering the microscopic origins of the correlated topological phases therein. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moiré potential modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution, yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near 2°, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moiré platform.</p>

            <h2>Gain-driven magnon-polariton dynamics in the ultrastrong coupling regime: Effective circuit approach for coherence versus nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryunosuke Suzuki, Takahiro Chiba, Hiroaki Matsueda</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the dynamics of gain-driven magnon-polaritons (MPs), which characterizes auto-oscillation of MPs, across the strong coupling (SC) and ultrastrong coupling (USC) regimes. Taking into account the magnon dynamics via the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven MPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size of a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to the shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr nonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon coupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent magnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also effectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies, resulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one to widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic field. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the coupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work is attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in nonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable maser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs.</p>

            <p>Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin films and thus include, besides the more bulk-like inner layers, distinct surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate, respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover, surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$ and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.</p>

In addition, a kink-like feature is observed in the magnetization under B || [111], at which the magnetostriction also shows a convex field dependence. Our classical Monte-Carlo and quantum exact diagonalization calculations demonstrate that these features in the magnetization are well reproduced by the spin Hamiltonian with a dominant interaction between the octupole moments and with a QSI ground state, indicating the emergence of a dipole-octupole QSI in this compound.</p>

We identify an intermediate fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes, spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering, magnetization, and magnetostriction.</p>

            <p>2D van der Waals ferromagnets hold immense promise for spintronic applications due to their controllability and versatility. Despite their significance, the realization and in-depth characterization of ferromagnetic materials in atomically thin single layers, close to the true 2D limit, has been scarce. Here, a successful synthesis of monolayer (ML) 1T-CrTe2 is reported on a bilayer graphene (BLG) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, that the ferromagnetic transition is observed at the Curie temperature (TC) of 150 K in ML 1T-CrTe2 on BLG, accompanied by unconventional temperature-dependent band evolutions. The spectroscopic analysis and first-principle calculations reveal that the ferromagnetism may arise from Goodenough-Kanamori super-exchange and double-exchange interactions, enhanced by the lattice distortion and the electron doping from the BLG substrate. These findings provide pivotal insight into the fundamental understanding of mechanisms governing 2D ferromagnetism and offer a pathway for engineering higher TC in 2D materials for future spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results agree well with experiments and establish a framework for predicting large phonon magnetism in magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon coupling. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moiré semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moiré valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in this moiré semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's moiré valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$ in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moiré honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave.</p>

In spite of the large size difference and the vastly different experimental schemes used to extract \k{appa}xx, we find in large part that both experiments yield similar results and conclude that the bulk of FQH states thermally conducts and violate the Wiedemann-Franz law by a wide margin. Slight discrepancies between both studies are further discussed in terms of particle-hole symmetry in the vicinity of the 5/2 and 7/3 FQH states.</p>

            <p>The search for intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) has long been confounded by coexisting electron-phonon coupling in bulk materials. Although the ground state of an EI may be difficult to differentiate from density-wave orders or other structural instabilities, excited states offer distinctive signatures. One way to provide clarity is to directly inspect the phonon spectral function for long wavelength broadening due to phonon interaction with the high velocity EI phason. Here, we report that the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) EI candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ shows extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and softening in the semimetallic normal state. In contrast, such a behavior is completely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the isostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state. By contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a putative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband electron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless coupling $\frac{g}{\omega_0}\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare "ultra-strong coupling" material.</p>

            <h2>Magnetotransport across Weyl semimetal grain boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyang Tian, Vatsal Dwivedi, Adam Yanis Chaou, Maxim Breitkreiz</p>
            <p>A clean interface between two Weyl semimetals features a universal, field-linear tunnel magnetoconductance of $(e^2/h)N_\mathrm{ho}$ per magnetic flux quantum, where $N_\mathrm{ho}$ is the number of chirality-preserving topological interface Fermi arcs. In this work we show that the linearity of the magnetoconductance is robust with to interface disorder. The slope of the magnetoconductance changes at a characteristic field strength $B_\mathrm{arc}$ -- the field strength for which the time taken to traverse the Fermi arc due to the Lorentz force is equal to the mean inter-arc scattering time. For fields much larger than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the magnetoconductance is unaffected by disorder. For fields much smaller than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the slope is no longer determined by $N_\mathrm{ho}$ but by the simple fraction $N_\mathrm{L} N_\mathrm{R}/(N_\mathrm{L}+N_\mathrm{R})$, where $N_\mathrm{L}$ and $N_\mathrm{R}$ are the numbers of Weyl-node pairs in the left and right Weyl semimetal, respectively. We also consider the effect of spatially correlated disorder potentials, where we find that $B_\mathrm{arc}$ decreases exponentially with increasing correlation length. Our results provide a possible explanation for the recently observed robustness of the negative linear magnetoresistance in grained Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking Phases in Steady States of Quantum Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Ziereis, Sanjay Moudgalya, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases and their transitions for both abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$ symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cataldi, Simone Orlando, Jad C. Halimeh</p>
            <p>Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</p>

            <h2>Fast simulation of fermions with reconfigurable qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishad Maskara, Marcin Kalinowski, Daniel Gonzalez-Cuadra, Mikhail D. Lukin</p>
            <p>Performing large-scale, accurate quantum simulations of many-fermion systems is a central challenge in quantum science, with applications in chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics. Despite significant progress, realizing generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time overhead, scaling as O(N) for N fermionic modes. Here we present a method for faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of O(log(N)) in the worst case, and O(1) for circuits with additional structure, including important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform. This exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings. We apply this technique to achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian simulation of the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and periodic materials, as well as free-fermion state-preparation. Moreover, we show that the algorithms themselves can be adapted to use only the O(1)-overhead structures to further reduce resource overhead. These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. Our results tightly bound the computational gap between fermionic and qubit models and open new directions in quantum simulation algorithm design and implementation.</p>

            <p>This work demonstrates the multifaceted dynamic motion and three-dimensional (3D) spatial manipulation of organic micro ring resonators (MRRs). The MRRs are fabricated via surface-tension-assisted self-assembly of 2,2'-((1E,1'E)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))bis(3,5-dibromophenol) (HDBP), exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) emission and frequency comb-type whispering gallery modes. Interestingly, the MRRs are micromechanically reconfigurable into various strained architectures, including lifting, transferring, vertical standing, axial spinning, and wheel-like rolling, using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. The MRRs retained their photonic traits throughout these dynamic motions, underscoring their mechanical robustness. Notably, the demonstration of axial spinning and rolling locomotion extends the manipulation capabilities beyond two-dimensional control, enabling complete 3D spatial control. These results establish a foundational platform for next-generation NLO mechanophotonic systems, where reconfigurable smart and soft photonic elements can be dynamically controlled with high spatial precision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu Yang, Bengy Tsz Tsun Wong, Yi Yang</p>
            <p>The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.</p>

            <h2>On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Martínez-Puig, Gianluca D'Agostino, Ana Oña, Javier Rodríguez-Rodríguez</p>
            <p>The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</p>

As paradigmatic example for the connection between DPTs and quantum Mpemba effects, we study one-dimensional (1D) interacting lattice fermions corresponding to a dissipative variant of the Gross-Neveu model.</p>

            <p>Linear operations, e.g., vector-matrix or vector-vector multiplications, are core operations of modern neural networks. To diminish computational time, these operations are implemented by parallel computations using different coprocessors. In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs, and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension. The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures, showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents.</p>

            <h2>Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine</h2>

            <p>This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</p>

In ice, the relaxation rates exhibit an activated temperature dependence with an isotope-independent activation energy. Across 248-273 K, the H_2O/D_2O relaxation rate ratio remains constant at 2.0 \pm 0.1. This scaling agrees with Kramers' theory in the high-friction limit if the moving mass is the proton or deuteron, indicating that dielectric relaxation is governed by a classic proton transfer over an energy barrier rather than molecular reorientation.</p>

We show that increasing memory can greatly widen the outbreak size distribution and reduce the disease lifetime. We also show that rescaled Markovian models fail to capture fluctuations in the non-Markovian case. Overall, our findings, confirmed against numerical simulations, demonstrate that memory strongly shapes epidemic dynamics and paves the way for extending such analyses to structured populations.</p>

            <p>Chromosomal crossovers play a crucial role in meiotic cell division, as they ensure proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic variability. Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i) the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one, and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e., they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana. Consequently, the extended coarsening model provides a solid framework for investigating the underlying mechanisms of crossover placement.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We show that, for sudden quenches, the work distribution reduces to the statistics of traces of powers of Haar unitaries, which are random unitary matrices drawn uniformly from the unitary group. For translation-invariant quadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and periodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary matrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the form $W=\sum_{r\le m} a_r\,\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ (and in models with pairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional $b_r\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate central limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\mathrm{Var}(W)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_r r\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also characterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example from many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of Fisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain. Various numerical diagnostics support the analytical results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debojit Chanda, Thomas G. Mason, Manas Khan</p>
            <p>In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles having anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier. The translational and rotational dynamics of such particles become coupled at higher densities, resulting in complex kinetics of their configurational ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional entropic system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and their respective contributions toward minimizing the free energy, we show that the range of accessible orientational states of the particles principally governs the pathways of structural evolution, as the orientational entropy dictates the minimization of the free energy and, hence, the resulting optimal equilibrium ordering. When the particles have access to a wider range of orientational states, the larger rotational component of configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of the side-aligned particles with restricted rotational fluctuations maximize the entropy with a greater contribution from the translational component, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. We further show that density influences the crystallization pathways indirectly by setting an upper bound on the range of accessible orientational states. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations further corroborate our findings, and their generalizability is demonstrated using a system of triangular particles. Thus, orientational dynamics is predicted to play a crucial role in governing the pathways for entropic ordering of various anisotropic shapes.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi$_2$ that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$ Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin--orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sean Sullivan, Seungjun Lee, Nathan J. Szymanski, Amil Merchant, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Tony Low, Christopher J. Bartel</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Self-Optimizing Machine Learning Potential Assisted Automated Workflow for Highly Efficient Complex Systems Material Design</h2>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized complex materials design by enabling rapid exploration of material configurational spaces via crystal structure prediction with ab initio accuracy. However, critical challenges persist in ensuring robust generalization to unknown structures and minimizing the requirement for substantial expert knowledge and time-consuming manual interventions. Here, we propose an automated crystal structure prediction framework built upon the attention-coupled neural networks potential to address these limitations. The generalizability of the potential is achieved by sampling regions across the local minima of the potential energy surface, where the self-evolving pipeline autonomously refines the potential iteratively while minimizing human intervention. The workflow is validated on Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems by exploring nearly 10 million configurations, demonstrating substantial speedup compared to first-principles calculations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating the exploration and discovery of complex multi-component functional materials.</p>

            <h2>Real-space observation of salt-dependent aging in Laponite gels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunichi Saito, Sooyeon Kim, Yuichi Taniguchi, Miho Yanagisawa</p>
            <p>Colloidal gels gradually evolve as their structures reorganize, a process known as aging. Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase. These findings provide insight into how aging and salt concentration shape the structure and dynamics of colloidal gels.</p>

            <h2>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Aguilera, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky</p>
            <p>We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</p>

            <h2>Integrability of the Kondo model with time dependent interaction strength</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori</p>
            <p>In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. We develop a new framework based on Bethe ansatz and construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example of $J(t)$ which satisfies these constraint equations. We show that in this case, the matrix difference equations turn into quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations, which are well studied in the literature. The framework developed in this work allows one to probe the non-equilibrium physics of the Kondo model, and being general, it also allows one to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-mediated intrinsic topological superconductivity in Fermi arcs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Mæland, Masoud Bahari, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We propose that phonons can intrinsically mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we find that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a range of chemical potentials around the Weyl nodes. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave Cooper pairing in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we find a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the Fermi arcs, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</p>

            <h2>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitê Kessler de Azambuja, David Möckli</p>
            <p>In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.</p>

            <h2>Role of long-range dipolar interactions in the simulation of the properties of polar crystals using effective atomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Yu, Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Jin-Zhu Zhao, Philippe Ghosez</p>
            <p>Driven by novel approaches and computational techniques, second-principles atomic potentials are nowadays at the forefront of computational materials science, enabling large-scale simulations of material properties with near-first-principles accuracy. However, their application to polar materials can be challenging, particularly when longitudinal-optical phonon modes are active on the material, as accurately modeling such systems requires incorporating the long-range part of the dipole-dipole interactions. In this study, we challenge the influence of these interactions on the properties of polar materials taking BaTiO$_3$ as paradigmatic example. By comparing models with and without the long-range part of the electrostatic contributions in a systematic way, we demonstrate that even if these interactions are neglected, the models can still provide an overall good description of the material, though they may lead to punctual significant artifacts. Our results propose a pathway to identify when an atomistic potential may be inadequate and needs to be corrected through the inclusion of the long-range part of dipolar interactions.</p>

            <p>We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of $q$-state Potts models with $q=4$, $5$, $6$, and $8$ using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the $q$ homogeneous phases and $q$-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies, respectively, for all values of $q$. However, for a factorizable $q$ value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For $q=6$, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Knotz, Till M. Muenker, Timo Betz, Matthias Krüger</p>
            <p>The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</p>

We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</p>

            <p>The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.</p>

            <p>By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process has stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by Bäverstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</p>

            <p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films.

            <p>We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors $|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF $\Lambda$-bands.</p>

Our results demonstrate that, in addition to their intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the nonreciprocity of magnons is strongly influenced by the layer number, interlayer coupling, and magnon-magnon interactions. More importantly, in such layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit.</p>

A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity.

We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing.

Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.</p>

            <h2>Laser-engineered $Γ$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Li, Haijun Cao, Sheng Meng</p>
            <p>The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory and Single-shot Non-Clifford Gate beyond the $n^{1/3}$ Distance Barrier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu</p>
            <p>We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</p>

            <h2>Joint parameter estimations for spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Kuo Chen, Arnab Sen, Qiang Wu</p>
            <p>Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta>0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clarissa Lauditi, Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>Previous influential work showed that infinite width limits of neural networks in the lazy training regime are described by kernel machines. Here, we show that neural networks trained in the rich, feature learning infinite-width regime in two different settings are also described by kernel machines, but with data-dependent kernels. For both cases, we provide explicit expressions for the kernel predictors and prescriptions to numerically calculate them. To derive the first predictor, we study the large-width limit of feature-learning Bayesian networks, showing how feature learning leads to task-relevant adaptation of layer kernels and preactivation densities. The saddle point equations governing this limit result in a min-max optimization problem that defines the kernel predictor. To derive the second predictor, we study gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay in the infinite-width limit using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The fixed point equations of the arising DMFT defines the task-adapted internal representations and the kernel predictor. We compare our kernel predictors to kernels derived from lazy regime and demonstrate that our adaptive kernels achieve lower test loss on benchmark datasets.</p>

            <h2>Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Madadi, Lin Cheng, Pu Zhang</p>
            <p>The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</p>

            <p>Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Haiping Hu, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>As ultracold atom experiments become highly controlled and scalable quantum simulators, they require sophisticated control over high-dimensional parameter spaces and generate increasingly complex measurement data that need to be analyzed and interpreted efficiently. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been established as versatile tools for addressing these challenges, offering strategies for data interpretation, experimental control, and theoretical modeling. In this review, we provide a perspective on how machine learning is being applied across various aspects of quantum simulation, with a focus on cold atomic systems. Emphasis is placed on practical use cases -- from classifying many-body phases to optimizing experimental protocols and representing quantum states -- highlighting the specific contexts in which different ML approaches prove effective. Rather than presenting algorithmic details, we focus on the physical insights enabled by ML and the kinds of problems in quantum simulation where these methods offer tangible benefits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cristian Voinea, Wei Zhu, Nicolas Regnault, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere, previously limited to bosonic theories.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 extended diamond chain in a verdazyl-Cu complex, where competing interactions and lattice distortions give rise to exotic quantum phases. The magnetic properties exhibit a zero-field energy gap and 1/2 magnetization plateau, which is explained by a dimer-monomer model. Considering the effective interactions between the monomers, three types of dimer-dimer phases are expected to appear as the ground state, depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortions. By mapping to the nonlinear sigma model, three phases are distinguished topologically, and a symmetry-protected topological phase equivalent to the Haldane phase is identified. Furthermore, a nontrivial magnetization is observed above the 1/2 plateau region, suggesting a gapped dimer phase accompanied by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. The discovery of this rare quantum state has broad implications for strongly correlated systems, topological matter, and quantum information science, where symmetry and topology play crucial roles.</p>

            <p>The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$ exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density. To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$ below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported anomalies.</p>

Contrary to conventional expectations, spin transfer into graphene is not a passive process but is actively driven by spin-selective carrier filtering at the interface. Spin-polarized carriers generated in the WSe$_2$ layer induce a preferential migration of opposite-spin carriers from graphene, which results in net spin magnetization in graphene. This process is governed by interlayer band offsets, density-of-state asymmetry, and Pauli blocking. These findings indicate a microscopic mechanism of spin injection in non-magnetic systems and identify a guiding principle for the design of ultrafast opto-spintronic functionalities in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Understanding interfacial interactions in two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum technologies. We investigate metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown WSe$_2$ films (one to five layers) on graphene/SiC, directly compared to exfoliated WSe$_2$ on SiO$_2$, using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman measurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and the emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$. Concomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing WSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$ phonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with interfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$ on graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to SiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates: on SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on graphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined effects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced free-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role. These results establish graphene, unlike SiO$_2$, as an active interfacial partner that stabilizes excitonic states and enables engineering of the optical response of 2D heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report the first experimental observation of magnetic-field-induced quantized charge accumulation in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) system -- a phenomenon originating from the intrinsic two-dimensional surface state and fundamentally distinct from conventional edge-dependent transport phenomena. Our approach employs a novel out-of-plane capacitive detection method to directly probe this charge accumulation, revealing its distinction and correlation with other surface state properties, such as Laughlin charge pumping. We demonstrate that the accumulated charge density is governed by the quantized Hall conductance but is significantly influenced by dissipation effects due to finite longitudinal conductance. By performing frequency and longitudinal conductance dependence measurements, the underlying ideal quantized charge accumulation is extracted, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Importantly, our out-of-plane method of measuring charge accumulation allows the detection of small electric polarization in future studies, establishing a pathway toward the direct observation of the topological magnetoelectric effect, a manifestation of the four-dimensional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Hong She, Jing-Xuan Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question: can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around +2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ that appear structurally primed for two-orbital activity.

            <h2>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Zhou, Davide Gaiotto, Yin-Chen He</p>
            <p>The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work represents a step towards studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Giuseppe Catalano, Sven Benjamin Kožić, Gianpaolo Torre, Carola Ciaramelletti, Simone Paganelli, Fabio Franchini, Salvatore Marco Giampaolo</p>
            <p>Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Fritzsch, Gabriel O. Alves, Michael A. Rampp, Pieter W. Claeys</p>
            <p>Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</p>

            <h2>Electronic Fluctuations and Ionic Dynamics in Molten Silver Iodide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harender S. Dhattarwal, Richard C. Remsing</p>
            <p>Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of strong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic conductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear technology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the "electronic paddle-wheel" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Arean, Sebastian Grieninger, Pau G. Romeu</p>
            <p>We construct fully backreacted charged black brane solutions with a spatially disordered chemical potential in asymptotically AdS$_3$ and AdS$_4$, providing holographic duals of strongly coupled disordered systems. At intermediate temperatures these geometries display highly inhomogeneous horizons, though their geometric averages reproduce the clean BTZ and Reissner-Nordström solutions. The low temperature behavior, however, differs sharply between dimensions. In AdS$_3$, inhomogeneities decay and the horizon flows to the clean charged BTZ fixed point, rendering disorder irrelevant in the infrared. In AdS$_4$, horizon inhomogeneities persist: while the averaged geometry flows to the clean AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ throat, the disordered horizon induces a finite residual resistivity. These results show that disorder can qualitatively alter the IR physics of holographic metals and indicate violations of the Harris criterion in strongly coupled systems.</p>

            <p>Anisotropic metal nanostructures exhibit polarization-dependent light scattering. This property has been widely exploited to determine geometries of subwavelength structures using far-field microscopy. Here, we explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) to determine the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) such as in-plane orientation and aspect ratio under linearly polarized dark-field illumination in an optical microscope. We input polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal VAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data, using a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical parameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both dual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle prediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training set, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.95. This performance is only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2theta) fitting approach between the scattering intensity and the polarizing angle, which achieves MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99. Aspect ratio determination is also similar for the dual-VAE and physics-based fitting comparison (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23 and CCC of 0.53 vs. 0.68). By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio with spectra-only input in the small-data regime (300 particles), suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems requiring both structure and orientation information.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze Tao, Fujun Liu</p>
            <p>The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.</p>

            <p>We derive the far-field solution for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</p>

            <p>Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of collinear antiferromagnet with nearly zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) on the Néel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the fundamental relationship between the AHE and the Néel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal all the unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the Néel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall Néel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Specifically, we identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs for all altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the known spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets and a complete and pictorial classification of altermagnets based on the geometry of response functions.</p>

            <p>We provide a theoretical demonstration of controllable non-relativistic spin splitting in both electronic and magnonic bands via targeted structural distortions tied to specific phonon modes. Using MnF$_2$ as a model system, we identify a $d$-wave magnon band splitting between magnon modes of specific handedness, directly correlated with the non-relativistic spin splitting observed in the electronic structure. Crucially, we show that structural distortions associated with the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$ phonon modes (8.52 and 9.74 THz) modulate these splittings without altering the antiferromagnetic order. The effect originates from changes in the nonmagnetic ligand environment, highlighting the key role of lattice degrees of freedom in governing spin dynamics. Our findings establish a novel route for structure-mediated control of spin splitting, opening possibilities for tunable magnonic and spintronic functionalities in antiferromagnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Yang Li, Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Yang Li, Juven Wang, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from Kähler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</p>

            <p>The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.</p>

For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Muhammad Sedik</p>
            <p>We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</p>

            <p>The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste de Vaulx, Quintin N. Meier, Pierre Toulemonde, Andrés Cano, Valerio Olevano</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p>

The 3$\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films, becoming particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens for $T\gtrsim$300K, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques, and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. Based on a critical review of the technique's key technical aspects, this work provides practical support for a rapid and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase through to execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal design of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.</p>

            <p>Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder.

            <p>Superconducting interfaces have recently been demonstrated to contain a rich variety of effects that give rise to sizable thermoelectric responses and unexpected thermal properties, despite traditionally being considered poor thermoelectrics due to their intrinsic electron-hole symmetry. We review different mechanisms driving this response in hybrid normal-superconducting junctions, depending on the dimensionality of the mesoscopic interface. In addition to discussing heat to power conversion, cooling and heat transport, special emphasis is put on physical properties of hybrid devices that can be revealed by the thermoelectric effect.</p>

            <h2>Exact Expansion Formalism for Transport Properties of Heterogeneous Materials Characterized by Arbitrary Continuous Random Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyu Zhong, Sheng Mao</p>
            <p>We derive an exact contrast-expansion formalism for the effective conductivity of heterogeneous materials (media) with local properties described by arbitrary continuous random fields, significantly generalizing the widely used binary-field models. The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann-series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second- and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of novel graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals superconductors are attracting much attention owing to their rich phase diagrams including possible unconventional superconductivity. However, they suffer from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishi G. Gopalakrishnan, Binayyak B. Roy, Gargee Sharma, Sumanta Tewari</p>
            <p>We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogen defects and band alignment in metal-organic frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khang Hoang</p>
            <p>Band alignment, namely the prediction of band-edge positions of semiconductors and insulators in aqueous solutions, is an important problem in physics and chemistry. Such a prediction is especially challenging for complex materials. Here we present an approach to align band structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an absolute energy scale which can be used for direct comparison with experiments. Hydrogen defects are used as probes into the chemical bonding of the covalently bonded hybrid materials. An effective defect energy level, defined as the average of the charge-state transition levels of the defects at the linker and at the secondary building unit, is identified as a charge neutrality level to align band structures. This level captures subtle chemical details at both the organic and inorganic building blocks and provides results that are in agreement with experiments in a wide range of different MOFs. We also compare with results obtained from using other approaches involving surface calculations and average pore-center electrostatic potentials.</p>

            <p>We introduce an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts the cohesive energy of transition-metal alloys (TMAs) by embedding cohesion theory within graph neural networks (GNNs). Beyond accurate prediction of cohesive energy, a key indicator of thermodynamic stability, the model offers mechanistic insights by disentangling energy contributions into physically meaningful components. These data-driven interpretations reveal periodic trends and stability principles governing transition metals. We apply the model to single-atom alloys (SAAs) to assess their thermodynamic resilience against two destabilizing processes: agglomeration (adatom clustering) and segregation (migration into the subsurface). Our analysis shows that these phenomena are governed by distinct physical factors-agglomeration is primarily influenced by localized d-orbital coupling, while segregation is dictated by delocalized effects such as wavefunction renormalization. This model thus serves as an explainable AI tool for understanding and guiding the design of stable TMAs, with implications for catalysis and materials discovery.</p>

We study the evolution of mode frequencies as a function of temperature and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes.

            <p>The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the massive holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to an external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field--dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and massless Dirac particles for the magnetoconductivity and resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4\ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for short-range interhole interaction potential, and $T^2$-like behavior in case of long-range interhole interaction potential. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations. In contrast to this, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $\sim T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2\ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction. A classically strong magnetic field suppresses the interaction-induced corrections to magnetoresistivity of massless-massive hole gas mixture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zach LaDuca, Anshu Sirohi, Quinn Campbell, Jason K Kawasaki</p>
            <p>Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We identify challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moiré epitaxy. We highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene, which are crucial for navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy. In light of this weak remote potential, we re-evaluate the current state-of-the-art experimental evidence, highlighting why it remains challenging to experimentally validate a ``remote'' epitaxy mechanism that cannot be explained by alternatives, such as pinhole-seeded epitaxy or serial van der Waals epitaxy. We end with one experimental example that, to out knowledge, cannot be explained by competing mechanisms: a different long-range epitaxial relationship for GdPtSb films grown on graphene/sapphire, compared to direct epitaxy on sapphire. We suggest for future experiments that directly measure the remote potential and impact of tunable growth kinetics.</p>

            <p>Memory effects during metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel electronics mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in sequential non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as the full chain of transitions can involve features lasting anywhere from femtoseconds to microseconds. Here, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the dynamic range of timescales spanning 9 orders of magnitude to fully trace the pathways of photoexcited insulator-metal transition and the following relaxation through non-equilibrium metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a promising Mott material. We find 5 orders of magnitude variation in metal-insulator transition time, from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, depending on pre-excitation phase state. We provide a theoretical explanation and simulations based on strain feedback to domain nucleation. The lingering transition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity and, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by power laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential. The induced dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system signifies unusually high heterogeneity of transition barriers similar to biological systems, and demonstrates importance of non-local correlations of structure in evolution of transitional phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of $R$-parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fréchet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fréchet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.</p>

            <p>Compatibilized polymer blends are a complex, yet versatile and widespread category of material. When the components of a binary blend are immiscible, they are typically driven towards a macrophase-separated state, but with the introduction of electrostatic interactions, they can be either homogenized or shifted to microphase separation. However, both experimental and simulation approaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design space of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical interactions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we introduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field theory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly more accurate than conventional black-box machine learning approaches. The random phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine polymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA calculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a parallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally intensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer architecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the computational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly 100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer blend charge-compatibilization designs. More broadly, the white-box machine learning strategy offers a promising approach for dramatic acceleration of polymer field-theoretic methods for mapping out polymer phase behavior.</p>

            <p>We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.</p>

We claim that the existence of such a factor is universal. In \cite{Ref2}, we proposed an explanation for the AB effect (or equivalently, a supersymmetric Dirac monopole) based on SUSY. It is shown that this model opens a path to recapture this factor without the need for arguments related to attractive pairs. The idea is also applied to the case of a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) when it is coupled to $\mathcal{N}=1$, supergravity.</p>

By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.</p>

I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubble-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</p>

Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</p>

            <p>Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. This makes it particularly well suited for small-scale circuits that require repeated execution at large sampling rates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.</p>

The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</p>

            <h2>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin R. David, Srijan Kumar</p>
            <p>We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Padé extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</p>

            <h2>Violation of kinetic uncertainty relation in maser heat engines: Role of spontaneous emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varinder Singh, Euijoon Kwon, Jae Sung Lee</p>
            <p>We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of one and two qubit superconducting quantum gates under the non-Markovian $1/f$ noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.</p>

            <h2>Record High Polarization at 2V and Imprint-free operation in Superlattice HfO2-ZrO2 by Proper Tuning of Ferro and Antiferroelectricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinye Li, Sayani Majumdar</p>
            <p>Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological intelligence, offers a pathway to revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) by unifying memory and processing in an energy-efficient, sustainable framework for data-intensive tasks. Ferroelectric (FE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for implementing artificial synapses, yet achieving low-voltage operation in CMOS back-end compatible devices remains a major challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that proper tuning of ferro and antiferroelectric phases in HfO2-ZrO2(HZO) superlattice based capacitors can lead to imprint-free switching with record switchable polarization (2Pr) of 76 micro Coulomb cm-2 under an external field of only 2 MV cm-1. The sizable remanent polarization of the superlattice HZO further enables linear potentiation and depression with an on to off ratio of 20 within a 3 MV cm-1 bias window. Under pulsed operation, the devices show robust endurance, either maintaining polarization with less than 10 per cent degradation up to 10^8 cycles or surviving beyond 10^9 cycles with recoverable fatigue. By elucidating two distinct fatigue mechanisms, this work highlights strategies for optimizing FE devices to meet the stringent demands of neuromorphic training applications.</p>

            <h2>Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism revealed by polarized neutrons in MnF$_2$</h2>

            <p>Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.</p>

            <p>We study quantum control of classical motion of a two-dimensional exciton by optimizing the time-dependent electric field of a stripe-like gate acting on the exciton and inducing its time-dependent quantum dipole moment. We propose a search method that significantly reduces computational requirements while efficiently identifying optimal control parameters. By leveraging this method, one can precisely manipulate the exciton's final position and velocity over a specified evolution time. These results can be applied for control of exciton fluxes and population, and for spatially resolved light emission in two-dimensional semiconducting structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Meirinhos, Michael Turaev, Michael Kajan, Tim Bode, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>We provide a theoretical framework to describe the nonequilibrium temporal dynamics of correlated electron systems for realistic system parameters and the consequent, often exponentially long time scales. It is based on an entirely integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory, the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the nature of the emergent gauge field in composite-fermion metals: A large-scale microscopic study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amogh Anakru, Mytraya Gattu, Ajit C. Balram, Xiao-Chuan Wu, Prashant Kumar, Zhen Bi, J. K. Jain</p>
            <p>Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of $S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$, and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the $q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in $S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which also obtains its coefficient accurately.</p>

            <p>We present a computational investigation, in conjunction with synthesis and experimental characterization, into the structural, electronic, and optical properties of layered 2D organic lead bromide perovskites. We contrast materials based on the chiral (R/S)-4-fluoro-$\alpha$-methylbenzylammonium (R/S-FMBA), which have been shown to lead to bright room-temperature circularly polarized luminescence, with the similar achiral 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA). Using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we study relaxed structures (compared with X-ray diffraction, XRD) and optical absorption spectra (compared with experiments), as well as bandstructure and orbital character of transitions. We develop and provide a Python code to calculate octahedral distortions and compare DFT and XRD results, finding that vdW corrections are important for accuracy and that DFT overestimates octahedral tilt angles. (FMBA)$_2$PbBr$_4$ shows among the largest tilt angle differences (often termed $\Delta \beta$) reported, $14^\circ$, indicating strong inversion symmetry-breaking which enables its chiral emission. The lowest-energy optical transitions involve the perovskite only and are polarized within the layer.

The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</p>

            <p>Chirality in magnetic systems gives rise to a wide range of exotic phenomena, yet its influence in $S=1$ chains remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental study of a chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) $S=1$ chain, [Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{4}$]SO$_{4} \cdot$ H$_{2}$O (pym = pyrimidine), where the Ni(II) octahedral orientation exhibits a four-fold chiral periodicity. Muon spin rotation measurements indicate the onset of long-range magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 1.82(2)\,\mathrm{K}$. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the easy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order interactions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal dispersive spin-wave excitations well described by linear spin-wave theory, with Hamiltonian parameters $J_{0} = 6.81(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (intrachain exchange), $J'_{1\rm a} = -0.091(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (interchain exchange), and $D = -3.02(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (easy-axis single-ion anisotropy). These parameters are further validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetisation. Additionally, the INS data reveal multiple dispersionless bands, suggesting the presence of further excitations beyond the scope of our linear spin-wave theory.</p>

            <p>Under a sufficiently high applied electric field, a non-polar antiferroelectric material, such as \ce{PbZrO3}, can undergo a rapid transformation to a polar ferroelectric phase. While this behavior is promising for energy storage and electromechanical applications, a complete understanding of the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the phase transition remain elusive. Here, we employ \textit{operando} scanning transmission electron microscopy electric field biasing to directly resolve the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in \ce{PbZrO3} thin films under device-relevant conditions. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals a multi-step transition that includes several metastable phases. Complementary nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis further show that this pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to the formation of a \quotes{dead layer} near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior. Taking advantage of this depth-dependent heterogeneity, dynamic phase transformations are observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases. At this dynamic transition front, repeated phase interconversion is shown to be driven by competing internal (due to substrate clamping and extended defects) and external fields, allowing the relative energies of intermediate phases to be compared as a function of electric field. This work highlights the critical role of local energetics in phase stability and provides key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions, guiding the design of antiferroelectric-based devices.</p>

            <p>Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides - specifically twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ - have recently emerged as a versatile platform for strongly correlated and topological phases of matter. These two-dimensional systems host tunable flat Chern bands in which Coulomb interactions can dominate over kinetic energy, giving rise to a variety of interaction-driven phenomena. A series of groundbreaking experiments have revealed a rich landscape of quantum phases, including integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, quantum spin Hall states, anomalous Hall metals, zero-field composite Fermi liquids, and unconventional superconductors, along with more conventional topologically trivial correlated states including antiferromagnets. This review surveys recent experimental discoveries and theoretical progress in understanding these phases, with a focus on the key underlying mechanisms - band topology, electron interactions, symmetry breaking, and charge fractionalization. We emphasize the unique physics of twisted TMD homobilayers in comparison to other related systems, discuss open questions, and outline promising directions for future research.</p>

            <p>Our high-throughput computational screening of the Materials Project database has identified 140 candidate materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic behavior in the $Pnma$ space group. Through systematic density functional theory calculations comparing various magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that 91 of these compounds preferentially stabilize in altermagnetic ground states, with 20 adopting the perovskite structure. Using NaCoF$_3$ as a prototypical example, we perform a comprehensive investigation of its electronic structure, magnetic ordering, and orbital configurations. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions occupy the 4c Wyckoff position and support three distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, among which the $G$-AFM configuration emerges as the ground state. Detailed symmetry analysis uncovers that the inter-sublattice coupling in the $G$-AFM phase is mediated by the combined time-reversal and rotation operation $\hat{T}\{R_{2x}|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. This unique symmetry protection gives rise to several remarkable physical phenomena: (i) anisotropic optical conductivity, (ii) prominent anomalous transport effects including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Nernst effect (ANE), and thermal Hall effect (ATHE), and (iii) strong magneto-optical responses manifested through both Kerr and Faraday effects.</p>

            <p>We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</p>

            <p>We study a two-level dissipative non-equilibrium bosonic Rydberg system in an optical lattice, where multiple atoms can occupy a single site. The system is treated using two different approaches: solution of the master equation using a mean-field approximation, and direct numerical simulation of an equivalent quantum model. It is found that, depending on the on-site interaction strength, the system can either be uniform or have an antiferromagnet-like density-wave structure in terms of the Rydberg excitation distribution. Our mean-field treatment detects an interesting oscillatory phase as well, but the numerical simulation in 1D does not capture it. The origin of all these phases are investigated by studying the spatial correlations, and by calculating the fixed points of the dynamics. It is observed that an initial population difference across the sublattices helps to enhance the density-wave order. The scaling behavior of the system is also analyzed and a signature of weak universality is obtained.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of continuously varying critical exponents in coupled map lattice as an effect of quenched disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanka D. Bhoyar, Govindan Rangarajan, Prashant M. gade</p>
            <p>The transition to an absorbing phase in a spatiotemporal system is a well-investigated nonequilibrium dynamic transition. The absorbing phase transitions fall into a few universality classes, defined by the critical exponents observed at the critical point. We present a coupled map lattice (CML) model with quenched disorder in the couplings. In this model, spatial disorders are introduced in the form of asymmetric coupling with a larger coupling ($p$) to a neighbor on the right and a smaller coupling ($1-p$) to the neighbor on the left, for $0 \le p \le0.5$. For $p=0$, the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class. For $p>0$, we observe continuously changing critical exponents at the critical point. The order parameter is the fraction of turbulent sites $m(t)$. %sites that are not in the laminar region. We observe a power-law decay, $m(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$, at the critical point $\epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon$ is the diffusive coupling parameter. These exponents change continuously and do not match any known universality class in any limit. This could be related to changes in the eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix as the disorder is introduced.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-dissipation bounds for time-dependently driven conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Tesser, José Balduque, Janine Splettstoesser</p>
            <p>We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.</p>

            <p>In solid-state compounds, the valence of europium can sometimes be mixed -- which is especially favored in structures with several positions for the europium atoms. In this work, we study the Eu-based intermetallic noncentrosymmetric system Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ which has 65 atoms per unit cell and 4 distinct crystallographic positions for europium and 17 positions for mercury. Our detailed analysis of magnetism of large single crystals suggests that europium in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ might be present in two valence states, resulting in a fragile magnetic ground state. Due to the cage-like structure with a large distance between the Eu atoms, those atoms are weakly ferromagnetically coupled and Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ orders at low temperatures, below $T_{1} = 5.5$ K, with a subsequent spin re-orientation at $T_{2} = 4.3$ K. There is no sign of magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the magnetic ordering of europium sub-lattices results in a magnetization pole reversal with a weak ferrimagnetic ground state. Additional magnetic phases can be induced by application of a modest external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Controlling the Glass Transition through Active Fluctuating Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emir Sezik, Henry Alston, Thibault Bertrand</p>
            <p>Fluctuating pairwise interactions are understood to drive fluid-like states in dense biological systems. These states find a broad range of functionalities, such as directing growth during morphogenesis and forming aggregates with heightened mechanical response. However, a tractable model capturing the role of microscopic fluctuating interactions in these structural transitions is crucially lacking. Here, we study a $p$-spin model with fluctuating pairwise couplings (of strength $D_a$ and persistence time $t_a$) as a schematic model for interaction-mediated fluidization. We find that while stronger fluctuations suppress the glass transition, more persistent fluctuations have the opposite effect. We identify the presence of an emergent fluctuation-dissipation relation at long times. We numerically extract the critical temperature $T_c(D_a, t_a)$ from a scaling relation near the transition, illustrating how microscopic fluctuations control the glass transition.</p>

            <h2>Investigation on Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Magnetic Properties of Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles Synthesized at Lower Annealing Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naresh Prajapati, G. Surya Prakash, Manoj Kumar, Himanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Due to its multiferroic properties and narrow optical bandgap, Bismuth ferrite has been widely explored for spintronics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis applications. Bismuth ferrite can be synthesized in various forms like bulk, thin films, and nanostructures using various synthesis techniques. It is challenging to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase due to the volatile nature of bismuth and the very narrow temperature range for forming this phase. So, this work aims to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase at lower annealing temperatures using an efficient sol-gel method. We have chosen the annealing temperature from 450 to 650 C, and a detailed analysis of structural and optical properties is performed here. X-ray diffraction is used to confirm the crystalline nature of the material. Single-phase Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns is carried out to study the effect of annealing temperature on structural parameters. All the samples are crystalized in pure rhombohedral BiFeO3 phase with the R3c space group symmetry, except those annealed at higher temperatures, 600 C and 650 C. Strain and dislocation densities were decreasing with an increase in the annealing temperature. From the UV-visible analysis, a strong response is observed below 600 nm in the visible region, and the band gap from the absorption behaviour is estimated in the range of 2.26 - 2.60 eV for these Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the existence of metal-oxygen bonds in Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were found to be thermally stable from the thermal analysis performed using differential scanning calorimetry. Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles were weakly magnetic from the vibrating sample magnetometry analysis.</p>

            <p>We present a minimal model for mixtures of chiral active particles, formulated solely in terms of the number densities of the species. Nonreciprocity and chirality enter the chemical potential at vanishing order in spatial gradients, taking the form of local and non-local contributions. Chirality manifests as the curl of the nonreciprocal current, while the latter is simultaneously strongly modified by former. Their interplay generates distinctive dynamical states, including phase separation with edge currents and a spatiotemporally disordered phase with both chiral and nonreciprocal signatures.</p>

            <p>The quest for thermoelectric materials with high figures of merit is an ongoing and significant area of research. In this study, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy using density functional theory calculations implemented via the Wien2k package. Our approach begins with a thorough structural optimization to determine the equilibrium lattice parameter and the atomic positions of the constituent elements within the unit cell of CoTiSi. Following this, we analyze the thermal transport properties of the alloy under the constant relaxation time approximation, which allows us to gain insights into its thermoelectric performance. Our calculations reveal a substantial Seebeck voltage and thermopower, with notably higher values for P-type doping than N-type doping. This finding highlights the enhanced thermoelectric performance of P-type carriers in this material, providing a starting point for experimentalists to utilize this alloy for real device applications.</p>

            <p>The La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) perovskite has received a lot of attention due to its near room temperature magnetodielectric effect. Despite the recent efforts, the mechanism ruling the correlation between its magnetic and dielectric properties is not yet fully understood. In order to address this issue, we conducted a detailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic field-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive dilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the unit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments involving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of outermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects are the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed analysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose that the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the dielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic, elastic and dielectric properties in this material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernat Durà Faulí, Lennard Kwakernaak, Martin van Hecke</p>
            <p>Elastic instabilities such as buckling and snapping have evolved into a powerful design principle, enabling memory, sequential shape morphing, and computing in metamaterials and devices. Modifying the post-buckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of post-buckling behavior: under compression, slit-beams first buckle, then snap, leading to trista-bility within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multi-slit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multi-step snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left and right-buckled states. Our strategy is general, simple to design and implement, and enables mechanical metamaterials and devices with advanced memory and sequential behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abolfazl Ahmadirahmat, Michele Caraglio, Vincent Krakoviack, Thomas Franosch</p>
            <p>We derive a microscopic theory for the structural dynamics in the vicinity of the glass transition for a liquid exposed to a one-dimensional periodic potential. The periodic potential breaks translational invariance, in particular, the density exhibits a periodic modulation. Using techniques familiar from solid-state theory, we define generalized intermediate scattering functions from fluctuating densities in wave-vector space. Exact equations of motion are derived within the Mori-Zwanzig projection-operator formalism reflecting the residual lattice symmetries. Due to the lack of rotational symmetry it is necessary to split the currents into components parallel and perpendicular to the modulation. We provide a closure of the equations in terms of a mode-coupling approximation for the force kernel. The theory reflects the usual analytic properties of correlation functions and encodes all phenomena known for mode-coupling theories. We prove that the theory reduces to the conventional mode-coupling theory in the case of vanishing amplitude of the modulation.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Generation of Second-Harmonic Propagating Spin Waves in a Thin, Out-of-Plane-Magnetized Ferromagnetic Film</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathieu Moalic, Youenn Patat, Mateusz Zelent, Maciej Krawczyk</p>
            <p>Spin waves are attractive information carriers owing to their gigahertz-to-terahertz frequencies, nanometric wavelengths, and negligible Joule heating. Yet the efficient excitation of short-wavelength, high-frequency spin waves and the exploitation of nonlinear effects remain challenging. We propose a hybrid ferromagnetic nanostructure composed of a small, in-plane-magnetized rim (a magnonic nanocavity) exchange-coupled to an out-of-plane-magnetized region. Micromagnetic simulations show that a spatially uniform out-of-plane microwave field excites the rim's fundamental mode; its second harmonic is then coherently and efficiently launched into the second region of the structure, yielding propagating spin waves. The process can be realized in strip or disk geometries, providing excitation of plane-wave or radial spin waves, respectively. The conversion efficiency grows nonlinearly with the pump amplitude and can be further improved when the frequency of a higher-order standing wave in the nanocavity matches the second-harmonic frequency. The emission frequency is tunable via the bias magnetic field or the width of the nanocavity, suggesting a compact route toward on-chip, short-wavelength, high-frequency spin-wave sources for artificial neural networks.</p>

            <p>Electron mobility due to electron-phonon interaction is investigated for fully fluorinated/hydrogenated zig-zag carbon nanotubes containing one-dimensional alternating chains of carbon atoms with $\pi$-bonds. The behavior of mobility associated with changes in the tube diameter, coating type (F/H) and temperature is revealed. In particular, it is shown that the dependence of mobility on the diameter in such tubes is periodic with the chirality index, which is associated with the absence of scattering on TA phonons in the tubes with an even number of conducting chains due to mirror symmetry. The obtained small values of phonon-limited mobility indicate that tubes with one-dimensional conducting chains are more promising for use as gas sensors than as elements of electronic devices. Calculations are performed within the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA) using the non-orthogonal tight-binding approach.</p>

            <p>Power and efficiency are fundamental criteria for evaluating the performance of thermodynamic cycles. However, it is generally impossible to maximize both simultaneously. In particular, achieving maximum efficiency inevitably leads to vanishing power as the cycle duration approaches infinity. A quantitative characterization of this trade-off yields significant theoretical and practical implications. In this letter, we analytically derive an exact bound constraining power and efficiency in low-dissipation finite-time heat engines. This bound specifies the maximum power attainable at any prescribed efficiency, thereby providing a benchmarking for evaluating the performance of heat engines.</p>

            <p>Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies.

Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.</p>

            <p>Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) are often regarded as penetrable interfaces to dislocation motion, yet recent studies suggest they can also act as strong barriers. The origin of this duality remains debated, particularly regarding the role of elastic interactions. Here, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate dislocation transmission across various tilt LAGBs in BCC Fe. The results show that transmission resistance varies widely with boundary-dislocation geometry. Contrary to the prevailing view that dislocation reactions dominate, elastic interactions between lattice and boundary dislocations emerge as the primary controlling factor. Screw and screw-like dislocations generate shear stresses that bend GB dislocations and produce strong barriers, whereas edge dislocations lack such stresses and transmit more readily. Consequently, barrier strength increases as the dislocation character angle decreases, with screw dislocations experiencing the strongest resistance. An analytical model is developed that quantitatively predicts the net transmission stress, in excellent agreement with simulations. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for LAGB-dislocation interactions and offer guidance for designing LAGB-strengthened materials.</p>

            <p>We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a Néel or spiral magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility $\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping, $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature $T_{\rm nem} < T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime below $T^*$.</p>

            <p>Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Mursalin Islam, Michele Pini, R. Flores-Calderón, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium, we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order. In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast, the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends on the targeted phases.</p>

            <p>Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory (UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Subbaths Cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (SB-CDMFT)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. de Lagrave, D. Sénéchal, M. Charlebois</p>
            <p>Cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT) with an exact diagonalization (ED) impurity solver faces exponential scaling limitations from the Hilbert space dimension. We introduce subbath CDMFT (SB-CDMFT), an alternative to the conventional CDMFT-ED method in which the discrete bath is subdivided into separate subbaths, each coupled to the cluster with distinct hybridization functions. In this approach, only one subbath at a time is actively involved in ED, dramatically reducing the computational cost by replacing a single large impurity problem with multiple smaller separate ones. Our method successfully reproduces key physical properties including particle-hole symmetry and Mott physics, while allowing for an extended bath representation at a fraction of the typical computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Linking thermodynamic correlation signatures and superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesse C. Hoke, Yifan Li, Yuwen Hu, Julian May-Mann, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Trithep Devakul, Aaron Sharpe, Benjamin E. Feldman</p>
            <p>Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands. We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h) asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands. Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead, its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.</p>

            <h2>Energy and information: a chronicle of hesitations on the role of the observer in physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Didier Lairez</p>
            <p>Energy has no definition, except that given by a conservation principle which essentially amounts to defining it as the elements of an open list of unknown cardinality. Entropy, identified by Shannon as information we lack, has too many definitions. This results in an unstable and hesitant interpretation of their link. Thermodynamics, the science of changes in form of energy, is phenomenological, all its laws are induced from observation. From the origin, the concept of energy is linked to the observer's knowledge, to the information he has: what and where to look and with what instruments. Thermodynamics only addresses the sensible world. It is Aristotelian. But this is disturbing if we consider that reason can give us access to Plato's intelligible world, the one that is beyond the sensible world and independent of us. This is disturbing if we consider that science can access to the intrinsic properties of things, those which are independent of us. This is disturbing if we have a purely Platonic conception of science. Hence the statistical mechanics approach ("The rational foundation of thermodynamics", J.W. Gibbs). This is the first pendulum movement of ideas, whose oscillations continue to this day, because unfortunately statistical mechanics introduces many inconsistencies, mainly due to the ergodic hypothesis. Luckily, these inconsistencies are all solved by Shannon's information theory. Sadly, information theory is too Aristotelian and too conceptual. Fortunately, Landauer principle makes it more \textquote{physical}. This is currently the latest attempt to bringing the notions of energy and information back to what is considered the right side of science, that of Plato. Landauer principle is now commonly regarded as a fundamental law of physics. Unpleasantly, it can be shown that this principle is not one.</p>

            <h2>Tracking photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with simulated time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lina Fransén, Benjamin Roux, Sonia Coriani, Saikat Nandi, Morgane Vacher</p>
            <p>Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based photochromic systems.</p>

            <h2>Fourier Neural Operators for Time-Periodic Quantum Systems: Learning Floquet Hamiltonians, Observable Dynamics, and Operator Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Qi, Yang Peng, Christopher Earls</p>
            <p>Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Sun, Bowen Yang, Zongyuan Wang, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</p>

            <h2>Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijin Li</p>
            <p>Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO, achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</p>

            <p>Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ippo Orii</p>
            <p>In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</p>

We thoroughly analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed causal and well-balanced 2D fBm versions, deriving their auto- and cross-covariance structures in both time and frequency domains. In particular, we present the power spectral density of these processes and their increments. Our analytical findings are validated with numerical simulations.

            <p>While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989, Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both physics and mathematics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Keeling, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Mari-Carmen Bañuls, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The deployment of large cryogenic detector arrays, comprising hundreds to thousands of individual detectors, is highly beneficial for various cutting-edge applications, requiring large statistics, angular resolution or imaging capabilities.

Among the various multiplexing approaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the art, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work, we demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer tailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR) electronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels. The system operates reliably across the entire 4-8 GHz frequency band and achieves sufficiently low flux noise levels in flux-ramp-demodulated readout.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.</p>

The method exploits the position dependence of a continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser, we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to long-term frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.</p>

            <p>We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a well-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent conservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from within a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we partition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy exchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian of the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical minisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental data that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes several cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By tuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus the speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright universe. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation that could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to reproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that time in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges from thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental platform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.</p>

            <p>We put forward a novel formulation of the vortex gas model of turbulent circulation statistics to address the challenging case of nonplanar circulation contours. Relying upon a field-theoretical description, statistical moments of the circulation turn out to be functionally dependent on specific {\it{optimal surfaces}} bounded by the circulation loops. Circulation is modeled in the optimal curved spaces with the help of scalar vertex operators that represent the multifractal density fluctuations of Gaussian-correlated vortex structures. We show that minimal surfaces are optimal within the inertial range, but subdominant deviations are expected to become significant for contours with linear dimensions close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. As a case study, we demonstrate the model's applicability through a Monte Carlo evaluation of the circulation probability distribution function for a nonplanar contour, which is in excellent agreement with results of extensive direct numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>From lines to networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Barthelemy</p>
            <p>Many real-world networks, ranging from subway systems to polymer structures and fungal mycelia, do not form by the incremental addition of individual nodes but instead grow through the successive extension and intersection of lines or filaments. Yet most existing models for spatial network formation focus on node-based growth, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of systems built from spatially extended components. Here we introduce a minimal model for spatial networks, rooted in the iterative growth and intersection of lines-a mechanism inspired by diverse systems including transportation networks, fungal hyphae, and vascular structures. Unlike classical approaches, our model constructs networks by sequentially adding lines across a domain populated with randomly distributed points. Each line grows greedily to maximize local coverage, while subject to angular continuity and the requirement to intersect existing structures. This emphasis on extended, interacting elements governed by local optimization and geometric constraints leads to the spontaneous emergence of a core-and-branches architecture. The resulting networks display a range of non-trivial scaling behaviors: the number of intersections grows subquadratically; Flory exponents and fractal dimensions emerge consistent with empirical observations; and spatial scaling exponents depend on the heterogeneity of the underlying point distribution, aligning with measurements from subway systems. Our model thus captures key organizational features observed across diverse real-world networks, establishing a universal paradigm that goes beyond node-based approaches and demonstrates how the growth of spatially extended elements can shape the large-scale architecture of complex systems.</p>

For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</p>

            <p>We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk this http URL results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeqing Wang, Ran Qi</p>
            <p>Motivated by experiments of interacting quantum gases across high partial wave resonance, we investigated the thermodynamic properties as well as single particle spectrums of Bose gases in normal phase for different interaction strengths both for $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. The equation of state, contact density, momentum distributions, and self-energies of single particle Green's functions are obtained in the spirit of ladder diagram approximations. Radio frequency (RF) spectrum, as an important experimental approach to detect Feshbach molecules or interaction effect, is calculated at different temperatures. A reversed temperature dependence on the BEC side and BCS side is identified for both $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. An estimation for the signal of RF spectra under typical experimental conditions is also provided.</p>

            <h2>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Dependent Defect Merging Induces Bifurcated Dynamics in Active Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Shichen Liu, Hao Wang, Heun Jin Lee, Rob Phillips, Matt Thomson</p>
            <p>Cytoskeletal networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of defect merging remain poorly understood. Here we report a geometry-tunable merging mechanism in microtubule-motor networks initiated by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-close. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to zip up cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of overlapping boundary layers where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby merge the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is tunable by the network geometry.</p>

            <p>Deconfined quantum critical points are intriguing transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm which are usually identified by the appearance of a continuous phase transition between locally ordered phases. Here, we reveal the presence of deconfined quantum critical points with unexplored properties. Contrary to previously known examples, we show that the phenomenon of spin-charge separation peculiar to interacting low dimensional fermions can allow for the appearance of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. We first infer this point by performing a field theory analysis of generic one-dimensional fermionic systems in the low energy limit. Subsequently, we derive a microscopic model where phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can take place. Here, by performing a numerical analysis we explicitly derive, among others, the gaps, local order parameters and correlation functions behavior, supporting the presence of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. Our results thus provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannah Lange, Annika Böhler, Christopher Roth, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Sondheimer oscillations driven by commensurability between two quantizations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodong Guo, Xiaokang Li, Lingxiao Zhao, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia</p>
            <p>The electrical conductivity of metallic crystals exhibits size effects when the electron mean free path exceeds the sample thickness. One such phenomenon, known as Sondheimer oscillations, was discovered decades ago. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field, have been hitherto treated with no reference to Landau quantization. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thicknesses ranging from 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m, and demonstrate that the amplitude of the first ten oscillations is determined by the quantum of conductance and a length scale that depends on the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We argue that this scaling is unexpected in semiclassical scenarios and it arises from the degeneracy of the momentum derivative of the cross-sectional area $A$ along the orientation of the magnetic field $\frac{\partial A}{\partial k_z}$ in cadmium, which couples Landau quantization to the discretization of $k_z$ imposed by the finite sample thickness. We show that the oscillating component of the conductivity is uniquely governed by fundamental constants and the ratio of two degeneracies, which acts as an inverted filling factor. Our conjecture is supported by the absence of such scaling in thin copper crystals.</p>

Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. The inherent nanoscale structuring produces a robust, spatially varying near-field response, establishing moiré superlattices as a platform for engineering light-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotian Nie, Wei Zheng</p>
            <p>Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel phase of periodically driven matter that exhibits robust subharmonic oscillations without requiring disorder. However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed ``unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals'' (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform/staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.</p>

            <p>Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}>600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $>3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.</p>

By combining high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, with a finite-size scaling analysis informed by conformal field theory, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients of experimental relevance. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the $g$-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</p>

            <p>Aging limits lithium-ion battery lifetime and must be understood to improve durability and performance, requiring a detailed understanding of how aging alters the availability of cyclable lithium and the integrity of active particles. In this work, (de)lithiation mechanisms are examined and spatially-resolved at the microscale in aged graphite electrodes dismounted from a large format graphite/LiFePO4-Li(NiCoAl)O2 cell at 70% remaining capacity. A multi-technique workflow is employed, combining electrochemical methods with post-mortem structural and morphological analyses, and introducing synchrotron microX-ray 2D diffraction imaging as a technique to probe aged graphite, applied at C-rates from C/5 to C. In-plane and through-plane heterogeneities in graphite dynamics are evidenced, showing the presence of inactive regions localized in two dimensions. In these areas, particles are either disconnected (irreversibly lost) or kinetically limited (reactivated at a slow C-rate), with dead or slow particles exhibiting a wide range of compositions, from x = 0 to x = 1 in LixC6. These inactivated graphite particles are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the depth of the aged negative electrode. In particular, the most inactivated region localizes at the negative electrode-separator interface, correlating to overworking graphite near the separator.</p>

Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.</p>

            <p>Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) complicates spin and valley manipulation. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhances the SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding SOC strength and tunability. Here, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we reproducibly demonstrate spin-orbit splitting up to 1.5 meV - more than 1 order of magnitude higher than in pristine BLG. Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression via the perpendicular electric field. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish the SOC as a control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p>

            <p>Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a well-defined methodology called the multicollinear approach was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones. While previous research focuses on its matrix representation, the present work derives its operator formalism. We implement these new equations in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, which is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. Since the multicollinear approach was proposed for solving nonphysical properties and mathematical singularities in noncollinear functionals, we validate its accuracy in practical periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced barocaloric performance in neopentyl plastic crystal solid solutions</h2>

            <p>The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants that have lower environmental impact than traditional vapour compression fluids. However, optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without diminishing parameters including the accessible latent heat. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with just 2% pentaerythritol to improve the phase transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change ($|\Delta S_{it,rev}|$ = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that the temperature range of the first-order phase transition is broadened because the intermolecular hydrogen bond network is disrupted by the presence of molecular dopants. Dynamic effects are revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering, which shows reduced activation energies for the molecular rotational modes underpinning the entropic component of the barocaloric effect. We propose that exploiting the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is an effective strategy for designing practicable molecular BCs.</p>

            <p>EuAuSb is a triangular-lattice Dirac semimetal in which a topological Hall effect has been observed to develop in association with a magnetically-ordered phase. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements have identified an incommensurate helical order in which individual ferromagnetic Eu$^{2+}$ layers rotate in-plane by $\sim$120$^{\circ}$ from one layer to the next. An in-plane magnetic field distorts the incommensurate order, eventually leading to a first order transition to a state that is approximately commensurate and that is continuously polarized as the bulk magnetization approaches saturation. From an analysis of the magnetic diffraction intensities versus field, we find evidence for a dip in the ordered in-plane moment at the same field where the topological Hall effect is a maximum, and we propose that this is due to field-induced quantum spin fluctuations. Our electronic structure calculations yield exchange constants compatible with the helical order and show that the bands near the Fermi level lose their spin degeneracy via a mechanism similar to that in the collinear altermagnets. We find that, unlike the even symmetry seen in the altermagnets, the spin-splitting in EuAuSb has odd-wave symmetry similar to that recently found in a number of coplanar magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>The quantum dimer magnet, with antiferromagnetic intradimer and interdimer Heisenberg exchange between spin-1/2 moments, is known to host an up/down - down/up singlet ground state when the intradimer exchange is dominant. Rare-earth-based quantum dimer systems with strong spin-orbit coupling offer the opportunity for tuning their magnetic properties by using magnetic anisotropy as a control knob. Here, we present bulk characterization and neutron scattering measurements of the quantum dimer magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$. We find that the Yb$^{3+}$ ions can be described by an effective spin-1/2 model at low temperatures and the system does not show signs of magnetic order down to 50 mK. The magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron spectroscopy data can be well-described by an isolated dimer model with highly anisotropic exchange that stabilizes a singlet ground state with a wavefunction up/up - down/down or up/up + down/down. Our results show that strong spin-orbit coupling can induce novel entangled states of matter in quantum dimer magnets.</p>

            <h2>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Borges, Peter Lunts, Sung-Sik Lee</p>
            <p>We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Vazquez Von Bibow, Juan I. Perotti</p>
            <p>Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erdős-Rényi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</p>

For monolayer excitons, topological bands and in-gap helical edge states can emerge near the energy of 2p states.</p>

            <p>We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-Sensitive Imaging in Magnetic Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nejc Blaznik, Dries van Oosten, Peter van der Straten</p>
            <p>Nondestructive spin-resolved imaging of ultracold atomic gases requires calculating the differences of the refractive indices seen by two circular probe polarizations. Perfect overlap of the two images, corresponding to two different polarizations, is required well below the feature size of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that the birefringence of atoms in magnetic field gradients results in polarization-dependent aberrations in the image, which deteriorates the overlap. To that end, we develop a model that couples atomic tensor polarizability with position-dependent spin orientation and yields aberration predictions for accumulated phase shifts in arbitrary field geometries. Applied to data from an ultra-cold atomic cloud trapped in a Ioffe-Pritchard trap, the model quantitatively reproduces the observed distortion across a range of temperatures. A residual offset of $\sim1\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ remains even under uniform field conditions, likely due to optical asymmetries. For images obtained through off-axis holography, the full complex field of the probe enables post-processing removal of all magnetically induced aberrations through a single numerically calculated Fourier-space phase mask.</p>

            <p>Spatially resolved strain measurements are crucial to understanding the properties of engineering materials. Although strain measurements utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction offer high spatial resolution, they are limited to surface or thin samples. X-ray diffraction methods, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging and X-ray topography, enable strain measurements deep inside bulk materials but face challenges in simultaneously achieving both high spatial resolution and large field-of-view. Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) offers a promising solution with its ability to image bulk crystals at the nanoscale while offering a field-of-view approaching a few hundred $\mu$m. However, an inverse modeling framework to explicitly relate the angular shifts in DFXM to the strain and lattice rotation tensors is lacking. In this paper, we develop such an inverse modeling formalism. Using the oblique diffraction geometry, enabling access to noncoplanar symmetry-equivalent reflections, we demonstrate that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible. We also develop the computational framework to both forward calculate the anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for an individual pixel from DFXM experiments. Finally, utilizing the established formalism and computational framework, we present methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific angles of DFXM. The developed sensitivity analysis also enables explicit computation of the errors associated with the reconstruction of each component. The formalism, the computational framework, and the sensitivity analysis established in this paper should assist both the interpretation of past DFXM experiments and the design of future DFXM experiments.</p>

            <p>Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo this http URL also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renjie Zhao, Yiquan Zhang, Chenglin Luo</p>
            <p>The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mara Lozano, Hong-Yi Xie, Bruno Uchoa</p>
            <p>Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states, characterized by an envelope function with finite vorticity in momentum space. This vorticity is determined by the underlying topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless of the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate how band topology affects exciton properties, offering a framework for predicting light-matter interactions in topological materials with flat bands.</p>

            <p>Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating protein dynamics in cellular and in vitro environments. Polymeric crowders such as dextran and Ficoll are known to induce entropic forces, including depletion interactions, that promote structural organization, but the nanoscale consequences for protein dynamics remain less well understood. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the dynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and Ficoll. We find that depletion-driven short-range attractions combined with long-range repulsions give rise to intermediate-range order (IRO) once the polysaccharide overlap concentration $c^*$ is exceeded. These IRO features fluctuate on microsecond to millisecond timescales, strongly modulating the collective dynamics of ferritin. The magnitude of these effects depends sensitively on crowder type, concentration, and molecular weight. Normalizing the crowder concentration by $c^*$ reveals scaling behavior in ferritin self-diffusion with a crossover near 2$c^*$, marking a transition from depletion-enhanced mobility to viscosity-dominated slowing. Our results demonstrate that bulk properties alone cannot account for protein dynamics in crowded solutions, underscoring the need to include polymer-specific interactions and depletion theory in models of crowded environments.</p>

            <p>We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</p>

Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond.

            <p>We define quantum chaos and integrability in open quantum many-body systems as a dynamical property of single stochastic realizations, referred to as quantum trajectories. This definition relies on the predictions of random matrix theory applied to the subset of the Liouvillian spectrum involved in each quantum trajectory. Our approach, which we name spectral statistics of quantum trajectories (SSQT), enables a natural distinction between transient and steady-state quantum chaos as general phenomena in open setups. We test the generality and reliability of the SSQT criterion on several dissipative systems, further showing that an open system with a chaotic structure can evolve towards either a chaotic or integrable steady state. We apply our theoretical framework to two driven-dissipative bosonic systems. First, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, an example of quantum simulator, clarifying the interplay of integrability, transient, and steady-state chaos across its phase diagram. Our analysis shows the existence of an emergent dissipative quantum chaotic phase, whereas the classical and semi-classical limits display integrable behavior. In this regime, chaos arises from the quantum and classical fluctuations associated with the dissipation mechanisms. Second, we investigate dissipative quantum chaos in the dispersive readout of a transmon qubit: a measurement technique ubiquitous in superconducting-based quantum hardware. Through the SSQT, we distinguish regimes where the performance of the measurement instrument can be connected to the integrable or chaotic nature of the underlying driven-dissipative bosonic system. Our work offers a general understanding of the integrable and chaotic dynamics of open quantum systems and paves the way for the investigation of dissipative quantum chaos and its consequences on state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</p>

We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</p>

            <p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Etsuko Itou, Akira Matsumoto, Yu Nakayama, Toshiki Onagi</p>
            <p>Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</p>

            <h2>Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps</h2>

            <p>Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</p>

            <h2>Analytic theory of dropout regularization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Mori, Francesca Mignacco</p>
            <p>Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. Using a mean field approach, we uncover an intricate phase structure, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</p>

            <h2>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson</p>
            <p>To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computation of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue He, Daniel Escudero</p>
            <p>Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</p>

            <h2>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Jun Yan</p>
            <p>Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</p>

            <h2>Noise-induced Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maulana M. Fajar, Beta N. Pratiwi, Subur Pramono, Gagus K. Sunnardianto, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.</p>

            <p>Batteries with liquid alkali-metal negative electrodes offer a route to compact, high-performance energy storage. Innovation in alkali-metal management, i.e., controlled storage, release and transport of liquid alkali metal, can enable simpler and cheaper cell designs. Porous carbons have emerged as potential host materials for liquid alkali metals. Here, we study the wetting interactions between porous carbon hosts and liquid sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) as a function of carbon host morphology and surface functionalization via X-ray computed tomography. While as-received carbon samples show no affinity towards NaK, heat-treated carbon is spontaneously infiltrated with NaK filling almost the entire pore volume. We explore how forced wetting partially fills pores of NaK-repellent hosts, showing large differences in pore filling based on the average pore size of the host material. In electrochemical discharge experiments, we show that both as-received and heat-treated carbon felt enable high areal capacities beyond 40 mAh cm-2. However, the heat-treated carbon shows ten times lower overpotential. Finally, we demonstrate how heat-treated carbon felt can enable capillary transport of NaK. In summary, this study elucidates important aspects of the interactions between liquid alkali metals and porous carbon hosts, generating insights into possible applications in liquid alkali-metal batteries.</p>

            <h2>Wilson-Loop-Ideal Bands and General Idealization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiabin Yu, Biao Lian, Shinsei Ryu</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings. In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands. In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge (i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moiré Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states, respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below $5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid basis for future study of novel correlated physics.</p>

            <p>In single molecule toroics (SMTs) atomic spins and orbital currents generate magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, endowed with both magnetic and electric dipole symmetries, which can enable spin control via magnetoelectric effects as well as the development of robust qubits. In the archetypal Dy$_3$ SMT, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is challenging to detect and control. Larger molecular rings can offer an enhanced toroidal response amenable to direct observation and manipulation. Here we report SMT properties for the $3d$-$4f$ icosanuclear molecular ring Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$, displaying toroidal excitations of unprecedented magnitude and energy dispersion spanning a $\sim$62 billion dimensional toroidal space. We show these properties can be modeled using an ab initio-parameterised transfer matrix approach yielding excellent agreement with experiments. To assess the bulk toroidal polarization attainable in this system, we introduce the molar toroidal susceptibility $\xi$, a thermodynamic linear response function measuring the SMT finite-temperature toroidal polarization induced by a magnetic field with a small non-vanishing curl. Direct calculation of $\xi$ for Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$ reveals a significant finite-temperature ground state toroidal polarization which should be amenable to experimental detection via spatially-focused magnetic field curls, as attainable e.g. using focused femtosecond laser pulses. Our findings could thus pave the way for direct observation and manipulation of molecular toroidal moments.</p>

            <p>Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) is a promising organic molecule for applications in quantum information because of its thermal stability, efficient processing, and potential as a spin qubit. The deposition of VOPc in different molecular orientations allows the properties to be customized for integration into various devices. However, such customization has yet to be fully leveraged to alter its intrinsic properties, particularly optical emission. Normally, VOPc films on dielectric substrates emit a broad photoluminescence peak in the near-infrared range, attributed to transitions in the Pc ring from its pi orbital structure. In this work, we demonstrate that the dominant optical transition of VOPc can be shifted by over 250 meV through the controlled deposition of thin films on van der Waals material substrates. The weak interactions with van der Waals materials allow the molecules to uniquely self-assemble, resulting in modified optical behavior modulated by molecular phase and thickness. This work connects the self-assembling properties of molecules with their altered electronic structures and the resulting optical emission.</p>

            <p>We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene (RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings.</p>

            <p>Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work, we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes.</p>

This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations.

The system exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength. We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance. Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for quantum metrology.</p>

We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\lambda t + p(t) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda t + p(t))^2 + 4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the corresponding many-body wavefunction. We also discuss extensions to other one-dimensional integrable models with linear dispersion, such as Gross-Neveu and Thirring.

            <p>We study interaction-driven quantum phases in a two-dimensional generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) defined on a square lattice with inequivalent nearest-neighbor hopping, next-nearest-neighbor hopping and a staggered on-site potential. In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic band touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac nodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT, our self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate interactions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number. Interestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries, leading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the standard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice symmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic (BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the Hartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac nodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential. However, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed while the BNDS phase grows stronger.</p>

With a recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of three Pauli matrices in 2D quasi-momentum space plus 1D time [(2+1)D], and then respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the CS invariants near $\pm 1$ and 0, which are consistent with theoretical predictions.

            <p>We investigate Ising superconductivity in two archetypal intrinsic superconductors, monolayer 1H-TaS$_2$ and 1H-NbSe$_2$, in a bottom-up approach. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parameterizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, the screened interaction is evaluated microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In direct space, the screened potential displays for both systems long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign. Upon scaling, the oscillation pattern becomes universal, with the periodic features locked to the lattice. Solving the momentum-resolved gap equations, a chiral ground state with p-like symmetry is generically found. Due to the larger Ising spin-orbit coupling, the chiral gap is more anisotropic in TaS$_2$ than in NbSe$_2$. This is reflected in tunneling spectra displaying V-shaped features for the former, in quantitative agreement with low-temperature scanning tunneling experiments on TaS$_2$. At the same time, our results reconcile the apparent discordance with hard gap tunneling spectra reported for the sibling NbSe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in the d-electron Kondo insulator candidates FeSi and FeSb2, along with some recent reports of magnetic correlations in the surface transport properties of FeSi, we have investigated the low temperature surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2. By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the [100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel, which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator.</p>

            <h2>Extended Hubbard Model realized in 2D clusters of molecular anions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Tong, Katherine A. Cochrane, Bingkai Yuan, Tanya Roussy, Mona Berciu, Sarah A. Burke</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t<<U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models.</p>

            <h2>Skyrmion manipulation and logic gate functionality in transition metal multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamali Mukherjee, V Satya Narayana Murthy, Banasree Sadhukhan</p>
            <p>Magnetic skyrmions, due to their topological stability and high mobility, are strong candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices. To advance their practical applications, a detailed understanding of their nucleation and current-driven dynamics is essential. We investigate the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in a square nano structure (200 $\times$ 200 nm$^{2}$, 1 nm thick) of PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers subjected to nano second current pulses with magnitude ranging from (1-5)$\times$10$^{11}$ A/m$^2$. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate controlled motion of skyrmion under different types of spin-transfer torque (STT). The calculated skyrmion Hall angle (SkH) for Slonczewski type STT is ${\theta_{SkH}^{SL}} = 89.53^{\circ}$ for PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers which ensures the edge accululation of skyrmion like a track within the nano structure and we extend this idea further for different shape engineering of skyrmion in 4d tranisition metal multilayers by manipulating the magnitude and direction of current pulses. Next, we investigate the influence of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy ranging from (1.4 - 4.2) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with external magnetic field B$_{ext}$ = 2 T, and (0 - 2.8) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with B$_{ext}$ = 3 T respectively, on skyrmion dynamics for designing anisotropy-engineered barriers to guide their trajectories in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers. We use further these barriers to implement basic logic operations, including OR and AND gates, with skyrmions representing binary states. The calculatd skyrmion Hall angle for Zhang-Li type STT in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers is ${\theta_{SkH}^{ZL}} = 3.26^{\circ}$. Consequently, the skyrmions propagate predominantly along the direction of the applied current with minimal deflection, a feature that renders them highly suitable for logic operations.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianqi Zhong, Songyuan Geng, Haoxiang Li, Benjamin T. Zhou</p>
            <p>In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Phonon Quasiparticles from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjing Li, Yong Lu, Fawei Zheng</p>
            <p>Phonon anharmonicity are ubiquitous in real materials, creating finite phonon lifetimes. These effects are crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we define optimal phonon quasiparticles as those that maximize their lifetimes, and prove that the information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes, frequencies and lifetimes. We applied this method to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, revealing their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and obtaining the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons.</p>

            <p>We propose a continuum tensorial model for chiral smectic C (SmC$^*$) liquid crystals using a tensor-valued order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ to describe orientational order and a real-valued order parameter $\delta\rho$ to capture layer modulation. This model accounts for the coupled effects of nematic alignment, smectic layering, chirality and spontaneous polarisation inherent in SmC$^*$ systems. The model is validated through a series of numerical experiments -- helix, bistable switching, bookshelf and chevron, and defect in SmC$^*$. Our results highlight the model's capability to describe complex phenomena in SmC$^*$ liquid crystals, providing a robust foundation for further theoretical and applied studies on phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Vitrimers are a class of crosslinked polymer that are capable of undergoing bond exchange reactions, allowing structural reorganization while maintaining overall network integrity. Two key features that are particularly relevant when this vitrimer concept is used to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends are how they affect the (i) bulk polymer density and (ii) interfacial activity of the crosslink groups. To probe these issues, we model both a bulk polymer melt and a thin film of a polymer melt both with explicit small molecular crosslinkers, in the associative limit, i.e., when the number of crosslinks are fixed. We show that the bulk density and the distribution of stickers within a polymer matrix is strongly influenced by their size and interactions with the base polymer. Specifically, when the crosslinkers are chemically compatible with the base polymer, then the overall packing fraction increases, regardless of crosslinker size, while it decreases when crosslinkers are incompatible with the polymers. Similarly, the crosslinkers segregate preferentially to the polymer-air interface when they are incompatible with the polymer chains, leading to a reduction interfacial tension. Thus, these incompatible crosslinkers should help in affecting both the miscibility of polymer blends, and also their compatibility by creating copolymer structures at the interface. These results demonstrate the key role of crosslinker-polymer interactions and crosslinker size on the structural and interfacial properties of vitrimer melts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kitinan Pongsangangan</p>
            <p>The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use, especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Path integral approach to quantum thermalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Altland, Kun Woo Kim, Tobias Micklitz</p>
            <p>We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement.</p>

            <p>We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_0 > 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.</p>

            <p>Supercooled liquids undergo a rapid change in dynamics as they are cooled to their glass transition temperature and turn from a flowing liquid into an amorphous solid. Depending on how steeply the viscosity changes with temperature around the glass transition, glass formers are classified as strong or fragile. An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid and the broadness of its relaxation spectrum. However, the microscopic origins of this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated\cite. Here, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials with ionic interactions. We introduce a novel class of materials consisting of highly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic interactions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an unusually broad mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of ionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these charged materials follow a trend between fragility and relaxation broadness that is opposite to that of non-charged materials. This finding suggests a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification and opens up a route toward developing new materials that combine the processability of strong glass formers with the mechanical dissipation of polymers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vansh Kaushik, Sayan Choudhury, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase.</p>

            <p>The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.</p>

            <p>We revisit the irreversibility of the pendulum with time-dependent angular frequency, considered in a classical paper by K. Husimi. He introduced a parameter that measures the adiabaticity of a process utilizing an adiabatic invariant for the equation of motion of the pendulum. With this adiabaticity parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter. Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process, and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.</p>

            <p>Ferrons are quantum excitations of electric polarization in ferroelectrics and electric analogues of magnons but have lacked direct experimental verification at room temperature. We harness the coupling of soft phonons and ferroelectric order in layered NbOX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) to generate, detect, and control giant ferrons, creating a new class of ultralow-power, chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources. Multiple ferron modes produce intense, narrowband THz emission with quality factors up to 228 and radiation efficiencies up to five orders of magnitude greater than state of the art semiconductor emitters. Resonant excitation of a high-Q ferron mode achieves efficiencies two orders of magnitude higher than intense lithium niobate THz sources. We further demonstrate direct, non-volatile electric-field control of ferron oscillations. These findings provide evidence for multiple ferrons and establish Ferronics as a foundational platform for light- and field-driven control of quantum order, with broad impact on ultrafast electronics, photonics, quantum technologies, and next-generation wireless communication.</p>

            <p>In the recently discovered V-based kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order, raising a fundamental concern on the superconducting gap structure of such kagome superconductors in the presence of CDW orders. Here, we report directional soft point-contact Andreev reflection (SPCAR) spectroscopy measurements on the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, revealing compelling evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic superconducting gap pairing state. The SPCAR spectra measured with current injected parallel to the $ab$-plane exhibit an in-gap single conductance peak, in contrast to those of SPCAR spectra: a double-peak structure in the perpendicular direction. These spectra are well described by an anisotropic single-gap BTK model. The extracted superconducting gaps comprise an isotropic large gap and a strongly anisotropic gap, originating from different Fermi surface sheets. Quantitative analysis reveals an anisotropy around $\ sim$70\% with a gap minimum of about 0.15 meV. These results shed new light on the unconventional multiband pairing states in kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Controlling the collective motion of epithelial cell populations is fundamental for understanding multicellular self-organization and for advancing tissue engineering. Under spatial confinement, cells are known to exhibit either vortex rotation or oscillatory motion depending on boundary geometry, but the mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain unclear. Here, we investigated the collective motion of MDCK cells confined within a doublet circular boundary, where the confinement aspect ratio, defined as the distance between the centers of two circles relative to their radius, can be tuned by varying the degree of overlap. When the overlap is large, cells form a stable vortex. Increasing the confinement aspect ratio destabilizes this vortex and induces oscillatory motion characterized by periodic reversals of migration direction, before ultimately transitioning into disordered dynamics. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we developed simulations of self-propelled particles incorporating local alignment (LA) and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). The model successfully reproduced the experimentally observed transitions from vortices to oscillatory motion and further revealed that an appropriate balance between LA and CIL is critical for stabilizing vortex pairs with velocity reversals. Our findings demonstrate that the confinement aspect ratio serves as a minimal control parameter governing transitions in the collective dynamics of epithelial monolayers.</p>

The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</p>

            <h2>Bulk Ferroelectric Heterostructures: Imprinted Actuators</h2>

            <p>Domain switching is the cornerstone of ferroelectric materials. Most associated functionalities can be tuned via domain switching, including but not limited to piezoelectricity, thermal conductivity, domain wall conductivity and topological structures. However, achieving the full potential of reversible ferroelectric domain switching is restricted by the incomplete access to the entire ferroelectric texture space, as well as the memory effects and energy dissipation associated with the hysteretic nature of ferroelectrics. The manipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in epitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at heterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two dimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed to unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive control of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within the entire range of ferroelectric texture space. Exemplar DE-BFH ceramics exhibit unprecedented enhancement in reversible electrostrain and stability in both axial and shear modes, including a record high peak to peak shear strain up to 0.9% at intermediate field levels, confirmed by digital image correlation measurements and in-situ synchrotron XRD studies. The advancement of domain switching behaviour in DE-BFH could also promote development of new types of lead-free piezoelectric devices, including actuators, energy harvesters, multiple state memory devices, and domain wall switch. Moreover, design concept of DE-BFH could contribute to the creation of distinctive ferroelastic, ferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials by broadening its scope to the entire ferroic family, encompassing polycrystalline, single-crystal, and thin-film forms.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-required Orbital Selectivity in Monolayer FeSe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mercè Roig, Qiang Zou, Basu Dev Oli, Tatsuya Shishidou, Yue Yu, Huimin Zhang, Daniel F. Agterberg, Lian Li, Michael Weinert</p>
            <p>Orbital-selective correlations have been observed to play an important role in Fe-based superconductors. Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those in $\{xz,yz\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically, the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold screw axes.</p>

            <h2>Harnessing the polar vortex motion in oxide heterostructures</h2>

            <p>Polar topology, an analogue of the magnetic topology, serves as a large playground for exotic physical phenomena with a wide range of multifunctional applications. Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies that have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and information density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall dimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar topologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with their controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex manipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape transformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex motion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective lattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding environment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time observation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved through the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias fields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion in response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the conductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved controlled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable stability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further pinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the vortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of the vortex core. This study highlights the feasibility of harnessing vortex dynamics through external stimuli, advancing the fundamental physical understanding and prospects for next-generation polar vortex-based nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Scale Modeling and Predictive Control of Active Brownian Particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadra Saremi, Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh</p>
            <p>Active Brownian particles (ABPs) function as self-driving agents that display non-equilibrium behavior through their pairwise interactions which lead to phase separation and vortex patterns in both soft matter and living systems. A multiscale approach needs to link particle-level random motion to collective density evolution for proper management of these dynamic systems. Our research delivers a unified control system for ABP groups through particle-based simulation and spectral continuum modeling alongside model predictive control and deep learning forecasting. The N-particle Brownian dynamics simulations implement Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential to model excluded-volume interactions while incorporating thermal noise and angular velocity modulation with wavelength $\lambda$. The forced advection-diffusion equation describes the coarse-grained density evolution which the FTCS spectral space solver solves. A new MPC approach uses complex-valued density states to minimize immediate tracking errors against sinusoidal spatial setpoints with actuator limits and control penalties. The hybrid deep neural network combines Conv1D and LSTM and multi-head attention to learn future density profiles from simulated snapshot sequences.</p>

            <h2>Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven R. White</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature-compatible iron garnet films grown by liquid phase epitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamal Ben Youssef, Nathan Beaulieu, Richard Schlitz, Davit Petrosyan, Michaela Lammel, William Legrand</p>
            <p>Single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films (< 100 nm) form the backbone of magnonics, owing to the record-low losses affecting their magnetization dynamics. However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300 K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in low-temperature investigations.</p>

            <h2>Observation of the influence of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations using a cloud-accessible experiment platform of Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daichi Kagamihara, Hironori Kazuta, Yewei Wu, Noah Fitch, Ippei Danshita</p>
            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has allowed physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented convenience. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs and stimulate further development and use of cloud-based experiments in this field.</p>
