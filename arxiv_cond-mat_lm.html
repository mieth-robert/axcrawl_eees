            <h2>Zero-point energy of solids from vacuum fluctuation and quantum geometric force</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.</p>

            <h2>Impact of crystallinity on the circular and linear dichroism signals in chiral perovskite</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reshna Shrestha, Wanyi Nie</p>
            <p>Chiral perovskites owing to their broken mirror symmetry exhibit selective absorption of circularly polarized light manifesting a strong circular dichroism (CD). CD spectroscopy has been a key technique to understand chiral perovskites and how these semiconductors achieve chirality at the molecular level. However, there is a debate on whether the observed CD is intrinsic to the chiral crystal structures or is modulated by extrinsic phenomena particularly linear dichroism (LD) and linear birefringence (LB) effects. This work investigates the chiroptical properties of $(R-/S-\text{MBA})_2\mathrm{CuCl}_4$ (MBA = Methylbenzyl ammonium) series by thoroughly studying the contribution from LD and LB to the observed CD signals. The comparison of highly oriented and randomly oriented films exhibits notable LD and LB contributions to the observed CD, which are caused by orientation-dependent electric-field interactions and local anisotropy. Both randomly and highly oriented films exhibit distinct CD responses, with LD--LB effects largely dominating the CD in highly oriented films. This has been revealed by the obvious shift in the observed CD signals to the below-absorption-edge ($\sim 430$ nm) regime and broadening of features. Our findings demonstrate that careful consideration of crystal orientation and structural effects is necessary for appropriate interpretation of CD spectra in chiral perovskite thin films.</p>

            <h2>Ordering Mixed-Q Topological Magnetism into Lattice via Moire Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiudong Wang, Zhonglin He, Kaiying Dou, Ying Dai, Baibiao Huang, Yandong Ma</p>
            <p>Topological magnetic lattices offer a fertile ground for exploring fundamental physics and developing novel spintronic devices. However, current research is predominantly confined to single-Q topologies hosting uniform type of quasiparticle. The realization of exotic mixed-Q states, where distinct topological quasiparticles co-assemble into an ordered lattice, remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a generic mechanism to order disordered mixed-Q topological magnetism into periodic lattice via moire engineering. By leveraging the synergy between spatially modulated interlayer coupling and intrinsic intralayer magnetic frustration, we demonstrate that moire potential can effectively regularize skyrmions, antiskyrmions, and magnetic bubbles into a hybrid lattice. Combining first-principles with atomistic spin simulations, we validate this mechanism in twisted bilayer CrGaTe3, identifying it as an exemplary platform for hosting these complex ordered textures. We systematically map the phase evolution as a function of twist angle and biaxial strain, unveiling the critical role of moire potential in stabilizing mixed-Q lattice. Our findings significantly advance the frontier of topological and moire spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Excess photon-assisted noise of Majorana and Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Lin, Ying-Xin Liang, Ke He, Zhan Cao</p>
            <p>Photon-assisted tunneling arises under an ac bias, with the drive frequency setting the photon energy. The excess photon-assisted noise is defined as the difference between the shot noise under a combined dc and ac bias and that under a dc bias alone. We investigate this quantity in tunneling into Majorana or Andreev bound states, which are of great interest in the search for topological superconductors. Under a harmonic bias $V(t)=V_\mathrm{dc}[1-\cos(\Omega t)]$, the excess photon-assisted noise exhibits distinct behaviors: for Majorana or quasi-Majorana bound states, it undergoes multiple sign reversals as $V_\mathrm{dc}$ increases and vanishes at nonzero integer values of $eV_\mathrm{dc}/\Omega$ (with $e$ the elementary charge), whereas for zero-energy Andreev bound states--particularly those producing nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks--it remains strictly negative over the entire $V_\mathrm{dc}$ range.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian physics in the many-body system of Rydberg atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ya-Jun Wang, Jun Zhang, Dong-Sheng Ding</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian physics exhibits unique physical properties beyond those of traditional Hermitian systems, such as symmetry breaking, the emergence of exceptional points, topological phase transitions, and more. These phenomena have been extensively studied across various platforms, including quantum optics, cold atom systems, superconducting circuits, and condensed matter physics. Rydberg atoms, with their long-range interactions and flexible controllability, provide a promising platform for the experimental realization of non-Hermitian physics. This review primarily summarizes the key experimental and theoretical achievements in the field of non-Hermitian physics within Rydberg atomic systems in recent years. It outlines the fundamental construction of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals the effective dissipation mechanisms induced by Rydberg atomic interactions, and discusses their impact on spectral properties and symmetry breaking. These studies not only deepen the understanding of quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems but also highlight the unique value of Rydberg atomic platforms in realizing and controlling topological states.</p>

            <h2>Topological superconductivity on a kagome magnet coupled to a Rashba superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koji Kudo, Ryota Nakai, Hiroki Isobe, Kentaro Nomura</p>
            <p>A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion/Subdiffusion in the Pushy Random Walk</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ofek Lauber Bonomo, Itamar Shitrit, Shlomi Reuveni, Sidney Redner</p>
            <p>We introduce the pushy random walk, where a walker can push multiple obstacles, thereby penetrating large distances in environments with finite obstacle density. This process gives a more realistic depiction of experimentally observed interactions of active particles in dense media. In one dimension, the walker carves out an obstacle-free cavity whose length grows subdiffusively over time. In two dimensions, increasing obstacle density drives a transition from free diffusion to localized behavior, where the walker is trapped within a cavity whose radius again grows subdiffusively with time.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and Robust p-type Transistor based on Ultra-wide-bandgap Semiconductor</h2>

Belcourt, Sergey Rubanov, Hang Yin, David A. Broadway, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Xinmao Yin, Liang Wu, Dong-Chen Qi, Michael S. Fuhrer, Qingdong Ou, Xiao Renshaw Wang</p>
            <p>The p-type transistor is an indispensable component of semiconductor technology, enabling complementary operation with n-channel transistors for computation, storage, and communication. Achieving both high robustness and high efficiency is highly desirable but challenging for p-type transistors due to limited semiconductors with reliable hole transport and their high activation energies. Here, we achieved a robust yet efficient p-type transistor by heterogeneously integrating an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor and a high-k dielectric layer through van der Waals integration. The p-type transistor employs a two-dimensional hole channel on hydrogenated diamond (bandgap 5.6 eV) combined with a high-k (30.5) SrTiO3 perovskite membrane. At room temperature, the transistor exhibits stable operation with a high on-current (~200 mA/mm), low subthreshold swing (70 mV/dec), high hole mobility (566 cm^2/Vs to 572 cm^2/Vs) and high on-off ratio (~10^9). Furthermore, tuning annealing temperature allows operation in either enhancement or depletion mode. The robust p-type transistor with high efficiency holds great potential for future power electronics, UV optoelectronics, and harsh-environment electronic applications.</p>

            <h2>First-principles study on the high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity of Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides up to the liquid-nitrogen temperature range under high pressures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Min, Wang Yujie, Hu Kaige, Deng Huiqiu</p>
            <p>Ternary hydrides have emerged as the primary focus of the new wave of research into superconducting hydrides. In this work, Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides are explored under high pressures up to 300 GPa using the prediction method of the particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with first-principles calculations. Two new structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pmm2$-Mg$_3$TiH$_6$, are identified to be thermodynamically stable at both 200 GPa and 300 GPa. Thermodynamically stable structures of Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ are also identified, whose space groups are $R3/m$ at 200 GPa and $Pm\bar{3}m$ at 300 GPa, respectively. Among these Mg-Ti-H structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ achieves a record-high $T_\text{c}$ of 81.9 K at 170 GPa, exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Such a high $T_\text{c}$ is primarily attributed to strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) driven by low-frequency acoustic phonon modes, with the EPC strength reaching a large value of 1.54. The $T_\text{c}$ of $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ is predicted to be 40 K at 300 GPa. Furthermore, element substitution of Zr(Hf) for Ti achieves considerable enhancement of superconducting properties in our predicted hydrogen-rich and high-symmetric crystal structures, i.e., $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$. The high pressure required for dynamical stability is lowered to 100 GPa in both $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$ZrH$_{12}$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$HfH$_{12}$, and to 90 GPa and 120 GPa for $P4/nmm$-MgZrH$_6$ and $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$, respectively. Particularly, the electronic structure near the Fermi level is significantly modified in the $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$ phase, and pronounced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonon modes occurs. As a result, the EPC strength is enhanced to 1.72, leading to a higher $T_\text{c}$ of 86 K.</p>

            <h2>Complete electronic phase diagram and enhanced superconductivity in fluorine-doped PrFeAsO1-xFx</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Singh, Konrad Kwatek, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Taras Palasyuk, Cezariusz Jastrzębski, A. Szewczyk, Shiv J. Singh</p>
            <p>Establishing a complete electronic phase diagram for REFeAsO (RE = rare earth, RE1111) ironbased superconductors has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we report a systematic investigation of PrFeAsO1-xFx over the full nominal fluorine-doping range 0 to 1 and construct the first comprehensive electronic phase diagram for this system. The evolution from the nonsuperconducting parent compound to the fluorine-rich limit reveals a broad dome shaped superconducting region. Structural refinement demonstrates a systematic lattice contraction with increasing fluorine content (x), corroborated by Raman spectroscopy through softening of the Pr(A1g) phonon mode and hardening of the Fe(B1g) mode, confirming effective fluorine incorporation at the oxygen sites. The maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches up to 52.3 K, approximately 5 K higher than previous reports for Pr1111. Magnetotransport measurements yield large upper critical fields Hc2(0) exceeding 100 T, while analysis of resistive transition broadening reveals thermally activated flux flow with a crossover from single-vortex to collective pinning regimes. Specific-heat measurements exhibit a reduced jump deltaC/{\gamma}Tc < 1.43, reflecting strong superconducting fluctuations and multiband pairing. These results establish clear structure property correlations and provide a unified description of superconductivity across the entire doping range of the Pr1111 system.</p>

            <h2>Topological and Planar Hall Effect in Monoclinic van der Waals Ferromagnet NbFeTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchanda Mondal, Shubhankar Roy, Poulami Manna, Ravi Prakash Singh</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as a critical class of quantum materials for next-generation, low-dimensional spintronic devices. In this study, we report a comprehensive study of the transport properties of the layered soft ferromagnet $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. We report the first observation of the topological Hall effect (THE) and the planar Hall effect (PHE) in metallic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. THE signatures persist up to 45 K, while PHE remains evident well above Curie temperature ($T_C$). The observed negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, along with the PHE, provides strong evidence for a nontrivial electronic band structure. The coexistence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a substantial THE: two key properties that are highly desirable for future spintronics applications, makes monoclinic vdW ferromagnetic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$ a promising platform to advance spintronics applications.</p>

The parameters of the nuclear spin fluctuations within the carrier localization volume are evaluated. Dynamic polarization of the nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching 5 mT for acting on the electrons and -30 mT for acting on the holes.</p>

            <h2>Spin Splitter and Inverse Effects in Altermagnetic Hybrid Structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Sigales, Tim Kokkeler, Gonzalo de Polsi, Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.</p>

            <h2>Proton Quantum Effects on Electronic Excitation in Hydrogen-bonded Organic Solid: A First-Principles Green's Function Theory Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sampreeti Bhattacharya, Jianhang Xu, Ruiyi Zhou, Yosuke Kanai</p>
            <p>Nuclear quantum effects of protons on electronic excitations in hydrogen-bonded organic materials remains underexplored. In theoretical studies, modeling excitons in these extended systems is particularly difficult because they tend to have a large exciton binding energy and sometimes exhibit charge transfer character. We demonstrate how first-principles Green's function theory combined with the nuclear-electronic orbital method enables us to examine the nature of excitons in a prototypical organic solid of eumelanin, for which the extensive hydrogen bonds have been proposed to facilitate the formation of delocalized excitons. We investigate how the quantization of protons impacts electronic excitations. We discuss the extent to which the resulting proton quantum effects can be described as being derived from structure and how they induce molecular-level anisotropy for the excitons in the organic solid.</p>

            <h2>Engineering a Bound State in the Continuum via Quantum Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Guthmann, Louisa Marie Kienesberger, Felix Lang, Eleonora Lippi, Artur Widera</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>The 4-$ε$ Expansion for Long-range Interacting Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyi Li, Kun Chen, Youjin Deng</p>
            <p>The establishment of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point (WFP) for $O(n)$ spin models in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions stands as a cornerstone of the renormalization group (RG) theory for critical phenomena. However, when long-range (LR) interactions, algebraically decaying as $\propto 1/r^{d+\sigma}$, are introduced, the fate of the short-range WFP (SR-WFP) has remained a subject of intense debate since the 1970s. We employ two complementary techniques -- the standard field-theoretic RG and a perturbative bootstrap scheme, and perform the $\epsilon$-expansion calculations up to the two-loop level. We show that, as long as $\sigma<2$, the SR-WFP becomes unstable and a stable LR-WFP emerges, and, in the non-classical regime with $d/2 < \sigma < 2$, the critical exponents, including the anomalous dimension, are functions of $\epsilon$, $\delta=2-\sigma$ and $n$, which reduce to the exact results in the limiting cases $\epsilon \to 0$, $\delta \to 0$ or $n \to \infty$. Our $(4-\epsilon)$-expansion calculations support the scenario that the threshold between the LR- and SR-WFP occurs strictly at $\sigma_*=2$, well consistent with the recent high-precision numerical study while different from the widely accepted Sak's criterion.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Elastic Oscillations on Nucleation in Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.S. Nuradinov, O.V. Chistyakov, K.A. Sirenko, I.A. Nuradinov, D.O. Derecha</p>
            <p>This work is devoted to establishing the mechanisms of elastic oscillation influence on nucleation processes in metal melts. The method of physical modeling with low-temperature metallic alloys (Wood and Rose) and transparent organic media (salol, camphene, diphenylamine) was used. It was established that vibration and ultrasound significantly reduce the supercooling required to initiate crystallization. The effectiveness of the influence significantly increases for samples with solid substrates. The hypotheses about the influence through changes in melt viscosity and the exclusive role of cavitation were experimentally refuted. The transition from pre-cavitation to cavitation ultrasound regime is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the influence on nucleation. The mechanism of elastic oscillation influence is substantiated, which consists in mechanical impact on adsorbed crystal nuclei on the surfaces of solid substrates. Elastic oscillations increase the nucleation rate by creating growth steps (dislocations) on the surfaces of adsorbed nuclei as a result of mechanical friction of solid substrates and cavitation erosion. The results have fundamental significance for understanding the physical nature of metal crystallization and practical application for developing technologies for controlling structure formation.</p>

            <h2>Epitaxial lift-off of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membranes enabled by BaO sacrificial layers and restoration of the Curie temperature</h2>

            <p>Ultrathin complex-oxide membranes provide a powerful platform for strain engineering, interfacial control, and heterogeneous integration; however, their formation remains constrained by the availability and performance of suitable water-soluble sacrificial layers. This letter demonstrates that barium oxide (BaO) serves as a highly efficient and rapidly dissolving water-soluble sacrificial layer, enabling the epitaxial lift-off and transfer of ultrathin La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) membranes onto SiO$_x$/Si substrates. LSMO membranes with a thickness of approximately 8 nm are released using a BaO sacrificial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy, while high crystallinity is preserved and Ba interdiffusion is limited to a narrow interfacial region of approximately 0.5 nm. Post-transfer oxygen annealing at 600 ${}^\circ$C increases the Curie temperature ($T_C$) from 342 K to 346 K by eliminating Mn$^{2+}$ states associated with oxygen vacancies generated through oxygen extraction into the BaO layer. These results show that BaO provides a fast, scalable, and compositionally simple route for complex-oxide membrane release, while brief oxygen annealing is essential to restore the optimal Mn valence state and achieve the intrinsic high $T_C$.</p>

            <h2>CDW Gap Collapse and Weyl State Restoration in (TaSe4)2I via Coherent Phonons: A First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Jiang, Jigang Wang, Yong-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>Coherent phonon excitation offers a nonthermal route to control quantum phases of condensed matter. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phonon landscape of (TaSe4)2I in its charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. We identify nine symmetry-preserving Raman-active modes that can suppress the Gamma-Z direct gap to the meV scale and render the system globally gapless by generating Weyl nodes at generic k points. Among them, the 2.51 THz CDW amplitude mode A(18) directly weakens the Ta-chain tetramerization, approaching a transient restoration of the uniform-chain geometry. It is also the most efficient mode owing to its low frequency and a relatively small critical displacement dominated by Ta motions. Other Raman modes, dominated by Se vibrations, require significantly larger displacements to reach the Weyl-semimetallic regime and are generally less effective than A(18) at reducing the Ta-chain tetramerization. Furthermore, we explore nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions and find that the low-frequency infrared-active mode B3(7) (1.14 THz) exhibits strong anharmonic coupling with A(18), providing an indirect pathway to drive the system toward a Weyl-semimetallic regime. Our results provide predictive insight for ultrafast pump-probe experiments and present a generalizable framework for lattice-driven topological switching in quasi-one-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the impact of anti-site defects in magnetic transitions of few-layer MnBi2Te4 by operando heating</h2>

            <p>As the first experimentally discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4 has attracted widespread attentions, providing a unique platform for the exploration of topological quantum phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state. Despite the increasing number of potential factors affecting samples being identified, obtaining the high-quality device performance with desired topological quantum phases remains a challenge. In this work, by comparing the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) of crystals with different defect densities that are characterized by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that anti-site defects play an essential role in achieving ideal magnetic states. By measuring RMCD hysteresis loops with operando heating, we find that MnBi2Te4 few-layer samples are highly susceptible to thermal impact, even at temperature as low as 45°C. The magnetic behavior of heating-treated samples is akin to that of samples fabricated into devices, revealing the thermal impact on devices as well. Starting from few-layers with ideal layer-dependent magnetic order, thermal heating leads to the convergence of magnetization and transition fields between odd- and even-layers. The observed heating-induced magnetic evolution can serve as a valuable reference for assessing the sample quality or the density of anti-site defects. Our findings not only point out the long-standing hidden factor that arose controversies in MnBi2Te4, but also pave the way for controllably engineering the topological quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Lefevere, Hal Tasaki</p>
            <p>The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version that admits an exact recursion for the distribution of left--right crossings, and prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) for all length scales if $d\ge3$. A Gaussian approximation, supported by numerics, predicts that, in the marginal case $d=2$, this scaling acquires a logarithmic correction and that the variance-to-mean ratio of conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ (the ``$2/3$ law'') for all $d\ge2$. We conjecture that both effects persist beyond the hierarchical setting. We finally provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and interpret it as a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching.

            <h2>Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Superconductivity in La2SmNi2O7 Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minhui Xu, Yibo Wang, Jia Liu, Long Cheng, Shuyin Li, Shuaishuai Yin, Xu Zheng, Lixin Yu, Aidi Zhao, Xiaolong Li, Jiandi Zhang, Xiaofang Zhai</p>
            <p>The interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity is fundamental for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductors. In the recently discovered Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates-which achieve superconducting transition temperatures up to ~100 K-this connection has been theoretically predicted but experimentally unverified. Using compressively strained La2SmNi2O7 thin films, we report direct evidence for this interplay. We observe a characteristic 'Mexican hat'-shaped magnetoresistance, a signature of superconductivity coexisting with emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations. This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates. Our results establish not merely coexistence, but also a direct and novel correlation between AFM instability and superconductivity in nickelates, offering crucial insight into their pairing mechanism.</p>

            <p>The bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ undergoes a density wave transition near 150 K that has attracted intensive scrutiny, yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here we report polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering measurements on high-quality single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Below 150\,K, we observe a pronounced, symmetry-dependent redistribution of spectral weight in B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ channels, consistent with the formation of spin-density-wave (SDW) gaps. Quantitative analysis reveals momentum-selective SDW gap amplitudes, with intermediate-to-strong coupling near X/Y points of the Brillouin zone and weaker coupling along the diagonal direction, indicating an unconventional SDW driven by anisotropic electronic correlations. Our results establish the electronic character of the SDW in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and provide a microscopic foundation for understanding the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity under pressure in nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Linear Response and Optimal Fingerprinting for Nonautonomous Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valerio Lucarini</p>
            <p>We provide a link between response theory, pullback measures, and optimal fingerprinting method that paves the way for a) predicting the impact of acting forcings on time-dependent systems and b) attributing observed anomalies to acting forcings when the reference state in not time-independent. We first derive formulas for linear response theory for time-dependent Markov chains and diffusions processes. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and differentiability of the pullback measure under general (not necessarily slow or periodic) perturbations of the transition kernels. An explicit Green-Kubo-type formula for the linear response is derived. We analyze in detail the case of periodic reference dynamics, where the unperturbed pullback attractor is periodic but the response is generally not. Our formulas reduce to those of classic linear response if one considers a reference autonomous state. Finally, we show that our results allow for extending the theory of optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution of climate change (or change in any complex system) for the case of time-dependent background state and for the case where the optimal solution is sought for multiple time slices at the same time. We provide strong numerical support for the findings by applying our theory to a modified version of the Ghil-Sellers energy balance model where we include explicit time dependence in the reference state as a result of natural forcings. We verify the accuracy of response theory in predicting the impact of increases of $CO_2$ in the temperature field even when we discretize the system using Markov state modelling approach. Additionally, we consider a more complex modelling scenario where a localized aerosol forcing is also included in the system and show that the optimal fingerprinting method developed here is able to attribute the climate change signal to the acting forcings.</p>

            <p>Unconventional superconductors with nearly degenerate pairing states are rare. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has recently emerged as one of the few existing multi-phase superconductors. It exhibits a first-order phase transition between two distinct superconducting states when a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic $c$-axis. While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I. Here, we use ultrasound-propagation measurements at low temperatures, in high magnetic fields and under hydrostatic pressure to address this issue. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting order parameter in both phases is single-component, corroborating the role of local non-centrosymmetry in the development of multi-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. In addition, analysis of the elastic anomalies within the Landau framework of phase transitions strongly suggests the presence of an incommensurate magnetic order parameter in phase I.</p>

            <h2>From Connectivity to Rupture: A Coarse-Grained Stochastic Network Dynamics Approach to Polymer Network Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaswat Mohanty, Wei Cai</p>
            <p>We introduce a coarse-grained stochastic network dynamics (CGSND) framework for modeling deformation and rupture in polymer networks. The method replaces explicit molecular dynamics (MD) or coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) with network-level evolution rules while retaining chain entropic elasticity and force-controlled bond failure. Under uniaxial loading, CGSND reproduces the characteristic nonlinear stress--stretch response of elastomeric networks, including a well-defined ultimate tensile strength and post-peak softening due to progressive bond rupture. Comparison with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations shows that CGSND captures the qualitative form of the stress response and the onset of catastrophic damage despite its rate-independent formulation. Analysis of rupture kinetics reveals a pronounced peak in the bond-breaking hazard rate near the ultimate tensile strength in both approaches. In addition, the distribution of broken segment lengths remains statistically indistinguishable from the initial network, indicating that rupture is not biased toward short or long chains. Finally, the evolution of the Gini coefficient of bond force magnitudes reveals strong force localization preceding failure. These results demonstrate that CGSND provides a computationally efficient and physically interpretable framework for connecting force localization and rupture kinetics to macroscopic failure in polymer networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuaishuai Yuan, Gunther G. Andersson, Gregory F. Metha, Zetian Mi, Hong Guo</p>
            <p>Understanding how nanocluster cocatalysts modify the electronic structure of III-nitride surfaces is central to the rational design of efficient photocatalytic interfaces. Here, we establish design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on GaN-based semiconductors by systematically analyzing the spatially resolved electronic structure of GaN-, InGaN-, and ScGaN-based slabs decorated with six-atom elemental nanoclusters. Using a region-resolved projected local density of states (PLDOS) framework, we reveal that semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces operate as laterally heterogeneous electronic systems, in which nanocluster-covered regions govern charge injection and band bending, while uncovered nitride regions retain surface states that facilitate surface activation. We further show that cocatalyst effectiveness is controlled not only by hydrogen adsorption energy, but also by interfacial electrostatics, including band alignment, metal-induced gap-state suppression, and in-plane dipoles, with the semiconductor substrate defining the baseline electronic regime. Machine-learning regression models trained on physically motivated global and region-specific descriptors quantify the relative importance of these mechanisms and their correlation with hydrogen adsorption energetics. Together, this work provides transferable design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on III-nitrides and a generalizable first-principles framework for studying spatially heterogeneous semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces.</p>

            <p>The transition to a green hydrogen economy demands robust, scalable, and sustainable anodes for alkaline water electrolysis operating at industrial current densities (>1 A/cm2). However, achieving high activity and long-term stability under such conditions remains a formidable challenge with conventional catalysts. Here, we report a novel trimetallic CuNiFe anode fabricated through a rapid, single-step electrodeposition process at room temperature without organic additives. The catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of <270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and operates stably for over 500 hours at 1 A cm(-2) in 30 wt% KOH. In a practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM-WE), the CuNiFe anode enables a current density of 2.5 A cm(-2) at only 2.5 V, with a voltage efficiency of 66.8%. Beyond water splitting, this anode also significantly enhances CO2 electrolysis, tripling the CO2 reduction current density and steering selectivity toward valuable multi-carbon products when paired with commercial copper cathodes. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment confirms that the CuNiFe anode reduces the carbon footprint by an order of magnitude and decreases environmental impacts by 40-60% across multiple categories compared to benchmark IrRuO2. Our work establishes a scalable, high-performance, and environmentally benign anode technology, paving the way for cost-effective electrochemical production of green hydrogen and carbon-neutral chemicals.</p>

            <h2>Epitaxial Growth of Anisotropic SnSe on GaAs(001) via Step-Edge Orientation Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pooja D. Reddy, Zahra N. Heussen, Kunal Mukherjee</p>
            <p>Epitaxial growth of orthorhombic SnSe on cubic substrates is challenging due to lattice-symmetry mismatch and anisotropic bonding. Here we demonstrate that epitaxial films with sharp interfaces can be achieved for layered SnSe grown directly on on-axis and 4 degree miscut GaAs(001) substrates. The substrate miscut strongly influences the growth morphology, evolving from spirals on on-axis GaAs to a terraced structure on miscut GaAs. X-ray diffraction reveals that on-axis GaAs supports SnSe with two in-plane orientation variants, whereas the miscut substrate stabilizes a single orientation and introduces a small out-of-plane tilt. Accordingly, in-plane optical anisotropy is enhanced in the single variant film compared to the double variant, as determined by cross-polar reflectance. High-resolution TEM shows that the SnSe/GaAs interface is atomically abrupt and incoherent, characteristic of quasi-van der Waals epitaxy. We find a pronounced tendency for the zigzag edges of SnSe to align parallel to step edges on both substrates, and we show that step-skipping nucleation and layer growth on the miscut substrate leads to the additional tilt. These results establish direct SnSe/GaAs heteroepitaxy as a route to integrate anisotropic layered semiconductors with cubic platforms, and show that miscut substrates provide additional control over in-plane anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Spatially varying flow laws have been identified in dry granular flow, yet their applicability to unjammed suspensions remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the quasistatic suspension flow combines dry granular rheology with nonlocal effects in the shear band and damped viscous flow in the outer creep region. Through rotary shear experiments on a hydrogel granular raft, we observe that the flow decays from the interface in the quasistatic regime, where the particles remain mobile even below the yield stress. These findings suggest the universal flow law across the transition between jammed/brittle granular behavior and unjammed/ductile viscous flow.</p>

            <p>The structure and spatial statistical properties of amorphous ellipsoid assemblies have profound scientific and industrial significance in many systems, from cell assays to granular materials. This paper uses a fundamental theoretical relationship for mixture distributions to explain the observations of an extensive X-ray computed tomography study of granular ellipsoidal packings. We study a size-bi-disperse mixture of two types of ellipsoids of revolutions that have the same aspect ratio of alpha approximately equal to 0.57 and differ in size, by about 10% in linear dimension, and compare these to mono-disperse systems of ellipsoids with the same aspect ratio. Jammed configurations with a range of packing densities are achieved by employing different tapping protocols. We numerically interrogate the final packing configurations by analyses of the local packing fraction distributions calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. Our main finding is that the bi-disperse ellipsoidal packings studied here can be interpreted as a mixture of two uncorrelated mono-disperse packings, insensitive to the compaction protocol. Our results are consolidated by showing that the local packing fraction shows no correlation beyond their first shell of neighbours in the binary mixtures. We propose a model of uncorrelated binary mixture distribution that describes the observed experimental data with high accuracy. This analysis framework will enable future studies to test whether the observed mean-field behaviour is specific to the particular granular system or the specific parameter values studied here or if it is observed more broadly in other bi-disperse non-spherical particle systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Schroeder-Turk</p>
            <p>This article is a reflection on the themes of the Faraday Discussion meeting on "Biological and bio-inspired optics" held from 20 to 22 July 2020. It is a personal perspective on the nature of this field as a broad and interdisciplinary field that has led to a sound understanding of the material properties of biological nanostructured and optical materials. The article describes how the nature of the field and the themes of the conference are reflected in particular in work on the 3D bicontinuous biophotonic nanostructures known as single gyroids and in bicontinuous structures more broadly. Such single gyroid materials are found for example in the butterfly Thecla opisena, where the questions of biophotonic response, of bio-inspired optics, of the relationship between structure and function, and of the relationship between natural and synthetic realisations are closely interlinked. This multitude of facets of research on single gyroid structures reflects the beauty of the broader field of biophotonics, namely as a field that lives through embracing the serendipitous discovery of the biophotonic marvels that nature offers to us as seeds for in-depth analysis and understanding. The meandering nature of its discoveries, and the need to accept the slowness that comes from exploration of intellectually new or foreign territory, mean that the field shares some traits with biological evolution itself. Looking into the future, I consider that a closer engagement with living tissue and with the biological questions of function and formation, rather than with the materials science of biological materials, will help ensure the continuing great success of this field.</p>

            <h2>Variational Method for Interacting Surfaces with Higher-Form Global Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiyoharu Kawana</p>
            <p>We develop a variational method for interacting surface systems with higher-form global symmetries. As a natural extension of the conventional second-quantized Hamiltonian of interacting bosons, we explicitly construct a second-quantized Hamiltonian formulated in terms of a closed surface operator $\hat{\phi}[C_p^{}]$ charged under a $p$-form global symmetry. Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schrödinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(\psi^*\psi)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations. In the presence of external forces, however, solving the functional equation in full generality remains challenging. We argue, however, that the problem reduces to solving the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equation when external forces act separately on the center-of-mass and relative motions. In addition, we present analytic solutions for topological defects as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional bosonic systems. Finally, as a concrete microscopic model, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ lattice gauge theory and apply our variational method to this system.</p>

            <p>Spin-triplet superconductivity is an intriguing quantum coherent state with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which holds significant potential for future applications in quantum technology. However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors. We discuss the similarities between superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and superfluid $^3$He, focusing on their spin-triplet pairing states.</p>

            <p>We investigate thermodynamic operation of a quasiperiodic lattice with an exact mobility edge, described by the Biddle--Das Sarma model. We use this model as the working medium of a quantum Otto cycle and map its operating mode as a function of the hopping-range parameter $p$, the initial and final potential strengths $V_i$ and $V_f$, and two idealized protocols for the isolated strokes. In a near-adiabatic (state-frozen) protocol, where the density matrix is approximately unchanged during the isolated strokes, the cycle supports only two modes: a \emph{heater} and an \emph{accelerator}. In an adiabatic protocol, where level populations are preserved while the spectrum is deformed, two additional modes appear: a \emph{heat engine} and a \emph{refrigerator}. Our results show that mobility-edge systems can realize multiple thermodynamic functions within a single platform and provide guidance for switching between modes by tuning $p$, $V_i$, and $V_f$.</p>

            <p>2D van der Waals ferroelectrics, particularly alpha-In2Se3, have emerged as an attractive building block for next-generation information storage technologies due to their moderate band gap and robust ferroelectricity stabilized by dipole locking. alpha-In2Se3 can adopt either the distorted zincblende or wurtzite structures; however, the wurtzite phase has yet to be experimental-ly validated, and its large-scale synthesis poses significant challenges. Here, we report an in-situ transport growth of centimeter-scale wurtzite type alpha-In2Se3 films directly on SiO2 substrates using a process combining pulsed laser deposition and chemical vapor deposition. We demonstrate that it is a narrow bandgap ferroelectric semiconductor, featuring a Curie tem-perature exceeding 620 K, a tunable bandgap (0.8-1.6 eV) modulated by charged domain walls, and a large optical absorption coefficient of 1.3 times 10 powers 6 per centemeter. Moreover, light absorption promotes the dynamic conductance range, linearity, and symmetry of the synapse devices, leading to a high recognition accuracy of 92.3 percent in a supervised pattern classification task for neuromorphic computing. Our findings demonstrate a ferroelectric polymorphism of In2Se3, highlighting its potential in ferroelectric synapses for neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p>The presence of edge channels in the quantum Hall regime leads to dissipationless charge transport over long distances. When graphene is interfaced with a magnetic material, the exchange interaction lifts the Landau levels spin degeneracy. This causes the presence of counterflowing edge channels with opposite spin polarization. We show theoretically that the spin-flip scattering between these edge channels enables a dissipationless spin transport with larger than 100% spin polarization of the charge current. It also allows the transport of spin over macroscopically long distances, even in the absence of an applied charge current.</p>

            <p>Asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) along a one-dimensional (1D) open channel sets the paradigm for 1D driven models and nonequilibrium phase transitions in open 1D models. Inspired by the phenomenologies of an open TASEP with Langmuir kinetics (Lk) and with finite resources, we study the stationary densities and phase transitions in a TASEP with Lk connected to a particle reservoir at its both ends. We calculate the stationary density profiles and the phase transitions. The resulting phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters are significantly different from their counterparts in an open TASEP with Lk. In particular, some of the phases admissible in the open TASEP with Lk model are no longer possible. Intriguingly, our model that is closely related to a TASEP coupled with Lk on a ring with a point defect, admits more phases than the latter. Phenomenological implications of our results are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuta Takeuchi, Takashi Takahashi, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</p>
            <p>We analyze a variant of the Hopfield model that incorporates an unlearning mechanism based on spin correlations in the high-temperature regime. In the large system limit where extensively many patterns are stored, we employ the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz to characterize the model analytically. Our analysis provides a systematic and self-consistent framework that yields order-parameter equations and stability conditions at finite temperatures over a wide range of parameter settings. The resulting theory accurately captures the behavior of the signal-to-noise ratio, the memory capacity, and the criteria for selecting optimal hyperparameters, in agreement with the qualitative findings of Nokura (1996 \textit{J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.} \textbf{29} 3871). Moreover, the theoretical predictions show good agreement with numerical simulations, supporting the conclusion that unlearning enhances memory capacity by suppressing spurious memories.</p>

            <h2>Exact Stationary State of a $d$-dimensional Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Harmonic Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathis Guéneau, Satya N. Majumdar, Grégory Schehr</p>
            <p>We derive the exact nonequilibrium steady state of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in $d$ dimensions confined in an isotropic harmonic trap $V(\mathbf r)=\mu r^{2}/2$, with $r=\|\mathbf r\|$. Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/\mu$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D>0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \to 0$ and $D \to \infty$ respectively. All analytical predictions are systematically validated against numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically entangled oscillating state in a Bose gas with an attractive polaron</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saptarshi Majumdar, Aleksandra Petković</p>
            <p>We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of an attractively interacting impurity suddenly immersed with a nonzero initial velocity into a system of one-dimensional weakly interacting homogeneous bosons. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in the parameter space. Especially interesting is the relaxation of a fast impurity with a mass close to or exceeding the critical one, where the impurity exhibits undamped temporal long-lived velocity oscillations before reaching a stationary state. The underlying mechanism is the transient localization of a boson depletion cloud near the impurity, that oscillates around the boson density peak situated at the impurity position. The lifetime of this entangled oscillating state increases with the absolute value of the impurity-boson coupling. Cold atomic gases provide an ideal playground where this phenomenon can be probed.</p>

            <h2>Shear-Induced Collective Shape Oscillations in Dense Soft Suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Hadjifrangiskou, Rahil N. Valani, Diogo E. P. Pinto</p>
            <p>Dense suspensions of deformable particles can exhibit rich nonequilibrium dynamics arising from complex flow-structure coupling. Using a multi-phase field model, we show that steady shear drives an initially disordered, dense, soft suspension into a positionally and orientationally ordered state, within which particles undergo robust self-sustained shape oscillations. These oscillations originate from repeated T1 neighbor exchanges that force the ordered particle lattice to cyclically traverse different ordered configurations, coupling particle deformation to evolving lattice topology. By identifying the lattice angle as a key variable, we construct a minimal one-degree-of-freedom model that quantitatively captures the limit cycle oscillation. Because these mechanisms rely only on deformability, packing, and shear, they provide a generic route to collective time-dependent behavior in dense soft suspensions.</p>

            <h2>Ozonation of Dielectric Fosters Self-Healing Efficiency in Metalized-Film Capacitors: Quantum-Chemical Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadezhda A. Andreeva, Cuixia Liu, Vitaly V. Chaban</p>
            <p>Metalized-film capacitors (MFCs) employ polymer organic dielectrics like polypropylene (PP) and polyimide (PI), in which self-healing is seen as a key advantage. However, the performance of self-healing depends on specific chemical mechanisms involved. The formation of semiconductive carbonaceous soot represents a critical failure risk. This study investigates how oxygen atom impregnation through ozonation of the dielectric material tunes the composition and electrical conductivity of breakdown products in the PP and PI systems with aluminum-zinc electrodes. We revealed, at the atomistic level, that oxygen atoms tend to remove a fraction of carbon atoms from the semiconductive soot by oxidizing carbon into carbon monoxide in both polymers. In PP, oxygen fraction linearly increases gas mass fraction, thereby reducing soot fraction. In PI, the gas/soot ratio effect of oxygen content is less drastic, still clearly positive. The PP soot conductivity decreases uniformly as larger fractions of oxygen atoms are added. In turn, the PI conductivity drops to ~1500 S/m quickly. The PI soot exhibits narrower band gaps compared to that of PP. The oxygen fraction non-monotonically tailors band gaps, which generally increase. To summarize, ozonation enhances MFC reliability by increasing gas species fraction and reducing soot conductivity. We hereby provide numerical molecular-level insights to rationalize self-healing performance enhancement through polymer ozonation.</p>

            <p>Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) fall outside the standard Laughlin's and Jain's odd-denominator hierarchy. In this work, we study the FQHS $\nu=1/2$ in the lowest Landau level. The state is confined within a 70 nm-wide GaAs quantum well, where the electrons exhibit a bilayer-like charge distribution. Inter-layer interactions stabilize the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS, which is predicted to host quasiparticles with charge e/4 - with either Abelian or non-Abelian topological order. Here, we report on shot-noise measurements of partitioned quasiparticles at $\nu=1/2$, where charge partitioning is generated by a unique etch-defined quantum point contact. Our measurements were performed on two nominally identical devices, at two independent experimental setups. Analysis of shot noise in the weak-backscattering regime in each device reveals quasiparticles with charge e/4. These observations provide a clear benchmark for future studies aimed at probing the topological order of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS and its quasiparticles' exchange statistics.</p>

            <p>The Shastry-Sutherland lattice is a prototypical frustrated quantum magnet. It is notable for its exactly solvable dimer-singlet ground state and hosts a wealth of magnetic phenomena under external fields. Here, this work investigates the high-spin (S = 7/2) Eu-based magnet Eu2MgSi2O7 (EMSO) using low-temperature magnetothermal measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a giant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in this Shastry-Sutherland compound. The entropy change peak value is found to be 55.0 J kg-1 K-1 under a field change of B = 0-4 T, approximately 1.5 times larger than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG). Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration achieves a lowest temperature of 151 mK, deeply into the sub-Kelvin regime. Furthermore, a distinctive cooling effect persists below about 1 T, a characteristic absent for conventional magnetic coolants. A dipolar Shastry-Sutherland model is introduced as a minimal model to describe this system; in particular, the experimentally revealed 1/3 magnetization pseudo-plateau can be ascribed to the presence of dipolar couplings between Eu2+ ions, further stabilized by the thermal fluctuations, explaining the persistent cooling effect. This work establishes EMSO as a novel platform for exploring the dipolar Shastry-Sutherland system and for sub-Kelvin adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration.</p>

            <h2>Preserving Hamiltonian Locality in Real-Space Coarse-Graining via Kernel Projection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun Haoyuan</p>
            <p>Numerical simulations of critical lattice systems are fundamentally limited by critical slowing down, as long-range correlations are typically established through slow temporal equilibration. A physically constrained generative framework that replaces temporal relaxation with a spatial projection mechanism for critical systems is proposed. Using the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality as a benchmark, we introduce an energy-constrained kernel that synthesizes large-scale configurations from compact equilibrated seeds by enforcing Hamiltonian-level observables. The generated configurations are projected onto the nearest-neighbor energy manifold, ensuring thermodynamic consistency while retaining universal critical properties. We show that the resulting configurations reproduce scale-invariant spin correlations, Binder cumulants, and isotropic structure factors for lattice sizes exceeding 10,000, without iterative Monte Carlo equilibration. While not a strict renormalization group transformation, and motivated by renormalization ideas, the method provides a practical inverse mapping that retains universal features of criticality and enables efficient GPU-parallel generation of ultra-large critical ensembles.</p>

            <h2>Inverse orbital Hall effect induced terahertz emission enabled by a ferromagnet with quenched orbital moment in Fe/Pt/W trilayers</h2>

            <p>The inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) has recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging mechanism for terahertz (THz) emission based on ultrafast angular-momentum-to-charge conversion. Most experimental studies have focused on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling or pronounced orbital character, where sizable orbital Hall responses are expected. Elemental ferromagnets such as Fe are generally regarded as quenched orbital sources and are not expected to exhibit orbital-dominated THz emission. Here, we report a pronounced enhancement of THz emission in Fe/Pt/W trilayer heterostructures, despite the absence of detectable orbital contributions in the corresponding Fe/Pt and Fe/W bilayers. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal long-distance signal persistence, systematic delay accumulation, and pronounced pulse broadening with increasing W thickness. These features are inconsistent with diffusive spin transport and indicate that orbital angular momentum transport in the W layer, converted into charge current via the IOHE, becomes a dominant channel for THz emission in the trilayer configuration. Our results demonstrate that strong IOHE can emerge in heterostructures incorporating a quenched orbital ferromagnet, providing an effective route to enhance spintronic THz emitters through orbital Hall physics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the lattice dynamics of CaWO$_4$, a promising host crystal for erbium-based quantum memories, using inelastic neutron scattering together with density-functional perturbation theory. The measured phonon dispersion along the (100), (001), and (101) reciprocal space direction reveals phonon bands extending up to 130 meV, with a gap between 60 and 80 meV, in good agreement with our calculations. From a symmetry analysis of the phonon eigenmodes, we identify eight Raman-active modes that can couple directly to the Er$^{3+}$ crystal-field operators, including a low-energy $B_g$ mode at 9.1 meV that is expected to play a dominant role in phonon-assisted spin-lattice relaxation. These results provide a microscopic description of the phonon bath in CaWO$_4$ and establish a basis for engineering phononic environments to mitigate the loss of stored quantum states and optimize Er-doped CaWO$_4$ for quantum-memory applications.</p>

We extend the ellipsoid contact like potential model (ECP), suitably modified and used previously by our group to model lipid bilayer phases with considerable success. This potential is used for base-base interactions, along with other potentials to capture bending, dihedral and solvent effects. The model shows a phase transition during hybridization and is able to reproduce the experimental melting curves with sufficient adequacy.

            <p>We report a comprehensive investigation of the pressure effects on the magnetotransport properties of the topological material ZrTe5 within 1 to 8 GPa pressure range. With increasing pressure, the characteristic peak (Tp) in its electrical resistivity first shifts to higher temperature and then moves quickly towards the lower temperature before disappearing eventually at 6 GPa. Beyond 6 GPa, the system exhibits metallic behavior across the entire temperature range, and superconductivity emerges below Tc = 1.8 K at 8 GPa. Based on the systematic magnetotransport measurement under pressure, we demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs following a significant electronic structure modulation possibly due to pressure induced structural changes near 6 GPa, which coincides with dramatic enhancement of the magnetoresistance (MR) reaching up to 1400 percent. Our experimental results are substantiated by density functional theory calculations as the application of pressure drastically alters the density of states near the Fermi level. Notably, multiple hole pockets emerge at the Fermi level from 4 GPa onward, and their contributions are further enhanced with increasing pressure. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals a comprehensive evolution of electronic structure of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 under pressure and suggest a possible link between the Fermi surface reconstruction in the pressure range of structural transition and emergence of superconductivity</p>

            <p>Solid materials are commonly classified as crystalline or amorphous based on the presence or absence of long-range this http URL-organic frameworks (MOFs), like other solids,also display markedly different properties and functions in these two phases. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized structural state that retains long-range in-plane translational order while losing order along the stacking direction. Hypothesized since 1941 but not experimentally verified, this intermediate phase emerges in a crystalline MOFs via controlled thermal desolvation, which selectively disrupts the intrinsically weak interlayer interactions while preserving macroscopic structural coherence. Although the resulting material appears amorphous under conventional characterization, systematic synchrotron PXRD, total X-ray scattering, and low-dose high resolution TEM reveal clear in-plane periodicity. This material spontaneously delaminates in water into uniform, high-quality two-dimensional crystalline nanosheets, forming stable colloidal suspensions and exhibiting superlubricity comparable to graphene - but at less than 0.1% of the production cost. Our discovery finds a missing link within the long-standing crystalline-amorphous dichotomy, while providing an inherently scalable route to high-quality 2D crystals, and offering a conceptual and practical advance in phase engineering.</p>

            <h2>Homing through Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riya Singh, Pratikshya Jena, Anish Kumar, Shradha Mishra</p>
            <p>Homing and navigation are fundamental behaviors in biological systems that enable agents to reliably reach a target under uncertainty. We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to model adaptive homing in continuous two-dimensional domain. In this framework, the agent's state is given by its angular deviation from home, actions correspond to alignment or stochastic reorientation, and learning is driven by a radial-distance-based cost that penalizes motion away from the target. For a single self-propelled agent moving with constant speed, we find that the mean homing time $\langle T_{\mathrm{home}} \rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the rotational diffusion strength $D_r$, with an optimal noise level $D_r^{*}$, revealing a subtle interplay between exploration and goal-directed correction. Extending to two agents with soft repulsion, one agent consistently reaches home faster than the other, while in multi-agents system, repulsion ensures separation and the fastest agent becomes progressively faster as group size increases. Finally comparing the mean homing time $\langle T_{\mathrm{home}} \rangle$ of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) and RL agent over an identical range of $D_r$, we find that RL trajectories are shorter, less noisy, and consistently faster. Our results show that cost-driven learning, stochastic reorientation, and inter-agent interactions enable efficient adaptive navigation, linking individual and collective homing. This reinforcement learning framework captures key biological features such as feedback-based route learning, randomness to escape unfavorable orientations, and mutual coordination.</p>

            <p>Increasing precision in the growth of superlattices sparks hope in applications that may arise from engineering layered structures. Heterostructuring and functionalization of magnetic oxides have been very popular due to their versatility and readiness for integration in modern electronics. In this study, we provide yet another example of this phenomenology by predicting that an insulating ferromagnetic state can be realized in superlattices of LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ oriented along the (111) direction. In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions. Our results provide not only a new route to an insulating ferromagnet, but also novel insight into the intricate interplay between lattice symmetry, Hubbard physics and Hund's coupling to be exploited in next-generation spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses uphill transport (defined as a regime in which particle flow is opposite to the prescriptions of Fick's diffusion) in drift-diffusion particle transport constrained by volume exclusion. Firstly, we show that the stationary hydrodynamic limit of a multispecies, weakly asymmetric exclusion process (SHDL) naturally predicts precisely characterized uphill regimes in the space of external drivings. Then, with specific reference to systems of oppositely charged particles, we identify well-defined model hypotheses and extensions whereby the SHDL converges to the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, thus bridging the gap between exclusion-based particle models and continuum descriptions commonly used in engineering. The merits and limitations of the models in describing the particle fluxes and predicting uphill transport conditions are investigated in detail with respect to the adopted approximations and simplifications. The results demonstrate the persistence of uphill transport phenomena across modeling scales, clarify the conditions under which they occur, and suggest that uphill transport may play a significant role in nanoscale electrolytes, confined ionic and iontronic devices, and membrane-based technologies.</p>

            <p>Magnon confinement and trapping refer to the localization of magnons-quasiparticles that represent collective spin-wave excitations in magnetic materials-within specific regions or structures. This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moiré superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability.</p>

Within the geometric theory of defects, the metric yields a first-order (magnetic-like) coupling in the transverse dynamics, equivalent to an effective magnetic field $B_{eff}$ proportional to $p_z Omega$, where $Omega$ encodes the torsion strength. In the strong-coupling (Landau) regime, the planar coordinates obey [x,y] != 0 and the spectrum organizes into Landau-like levels with a slight electric-field-driven tilt and a uniform shift. Thus, increasing $Omega$ drives the system continuously toward the familiar Landau problem in flat space, with torsion setting the noncommutativity scale and controlling the approach to the Landau limit.</p>

X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy provide detailed insights into the film structure and morphology by systematic variation of the mixing ratio from pristine DBTTF to pristine HATCN. The measured electrical conductivity of thin films depends in a highly non-monotonic manner on the composition of the mixture and shows significantly improved charge transport compared to the pristine films. The temperature-dependent conductivity, charge carrier concentration, and mobility were investigated across these compositions. Surprisingly, all compositions exhibited n-type behavior, except for pristine DBTTF. This behavior is explained by the electronic structure of the mixtures, as revealed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicates that charge injection and transport occur via the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the DAC and HATCN. Additionally, the observed electrical conductivity is strongly influenced by morphology and structural ordering of the films. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of advanced materials with enhanced electrical performance.</p>

            <h2>Structural studies on $A_2$ReCl$_6$ ($A$=K, Rb, Cs): absence of Jahn-Teller distortion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Bertin, L. Kiefer, V. Pomjakushin, O. Fabelo, P. Becker, L. Bohaty, M. Braden</p>
            <p>K$_2$ReCl$_6$ belongs to the antifluorite family and exhibits a sequence of structural transitions above the onset of magnetic order at $T_N$ = 12 K. Because of its 5d3 electronic configuration in an octahedral coordination, the ground state is a pure spin state without orbital degeneracy within the LS coupling scheme, but it can become Jahn-Teller active in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit described by the $jj$ coupling [S. Streltsov and D. I. Khomskii, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031043 (2020)]. While the structural transitions in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ are understood in terms of octahedral rotation and tilting, the possible impact of a Jahn-Teller distortion remains an open issue. We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion. While the ReCl$_6$ octahedron in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ presents sizable distortions at intermediate temperatures, there is no such distortion persisting to low temperatures excluding a sizable Jahn-Teller effect. Studies on polycrystalline samples of Rb$_2$ReCl$_6$ and Cs$_2$ReCl$_6$, in which the structural transitions are suppressed due to the larger alkaline ionic radius, also do not find any indications for a Jahn-Teller distortion.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated spin models on two- and three-dimensional decorated lattices with high residual entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. V. Dmitriev, V. Ya. Krivnov, O. A. Vasilyev</p>
            <p>We study the ground-state properties of a family of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg models on two- and three-dimensional decorated lattices composed of connected star-shaped units. Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines.</p>

            <p>One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, natural product characterization, and metabolomics, yet its interpretation remains heavily dependent on expert knowledge and difficult to scale. Although machine learning has been applied to NMR spectrum prediction, library retrieval, and structure generation, these tasks have evolved in isolation using simulated data and incompatible spectral representations, limiting their utility under real experimental this http URL we present NMRPeak, a unified cross-modal learning system that integrates these three tasks through experimentally grounded design. We curate approximately 1.8 million experimental and simulated spectra to construct the largest benchmark for NMR-based structure elucidation and systematically quantify the distribution shift between these domains. We introduce a chemically-aware adaptive tokenizer that dynamically balances discretization granularity to preserve spectral semantics while controlling vocabulary size, and an assignment-free peak-aware similarity metric that enables direct comparison between predicted and experimental spectra. Through a unified molecule-to-spectrum paradigm and synergistic coupling of prediction, retrieval, and generation modules, NMRPeak achieves transformative performance on experimental benchmarks: it overcomes the longstanding simulation-to-experiment gap in spectrum prediction while delivering over 95% top-1 accuracy in molecular retrieval and approximately 75% top-1 accuracy in stereochemistry-aware de novo structure generation. These capabilities establish a foundation for automated, high-throughput molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and chemical biology.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-CrSb and In-CrSb-In proximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium leads and thick single crystal flakes of altermagnet CrSb. For double In-CrSb-In junctions, the obtained $dV/dI(B)$ curves are mirrored in respect to zero field for two magnetic field sweep directions, which is characteristic behavior of a Josephson spin valve. Also, we demonstrate Josephson diode effect by direct measurement of the critical current for two opposite directions in external magnetic field. We interpret these observations as a joint effect of the spin-polarized topological surface states and the altermagnetic spin splitting of the bulk bands in CrSb. For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The latter is based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing against a background of the Zeeman splitting, so it is fully compatible with the requirements for the Josephson diode effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Yadav, Pascal Simon, Andrzej Ptok</p>
            <p>Monoatomic chains with magnetic order in proximity of a s-wave superconductor can host Majorana edge modes. In this paper, we extend this idea to more complex spin-block chains such as the BaFe$_{2}$S$_{3}$ magnetic material that has a spin-ladder like structure. We investigate the topological phase diagram of such a system as function of the system parameters. We show that the coupling between chains within the ladder leads to the topological phase with a winding number larger than the sum of two single magnetic chains. Furthermore, strong coupling between chains leads to fractal-like substructure in the topological phase diagram. By investigating the real space properties of such a system and particularly its edge modes, we find that the system spectrum contains several in-gap states that we analyze in detail.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the emergence of altermagnetism at the surfaces of antiferromagnets, vastly expanding the number of material candidates with altermagnetic characteristics and establishing a route to two-dimensional altermagnetism through surface-induced symmetry breaking. We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ersoy Sasioglu, Ingrid Mertig, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Broken inversion symmetry at the surfaces of centrosymmetric collinear antiferromagnets lifts the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry ($PT$) and can generate nonrelativistic d-wave spin splitting, termed surface altermagnetism. Combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we show that surface inversion breaking, while necessary, is not sufficient for this effect. Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly for the G-type antiferromagnets V$_3$Al and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, and show that the same symmetry criterion applies broadly across distinct structural families of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. These results establish a general, symmetry-based route to realizing robust, exchange-driven spin polarization at antiferromagnetic surfaces and interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Theiler, Christian R. Ast, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>An impurity hosting a magnetic moment coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor gives rise to so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $\pi$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $\pi$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $\pi$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $\pi$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length.</p>

            <p>Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems due to their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000 oC/s, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with sub-grain boundaries fraction of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kV/cm) and large polarization (70 uC/cm2). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 J/cm3 and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250 oC. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We compute longitudinal magnetoelectric conductivity ($\sigma_{zz}$) and nonlinear electrochemical response (ECR), applying the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, for three-dimensional nodal-ring semimetals (vortex nodal-rings and $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric nodal-rings) and three-band Hopf semimetals. While the nodal-curves of the former are taken to lie along the $k_z = 0$-plane, the nodal points of the latter harbour dipoles in their Berry-curvature (BC) profile, with the dipole's axis aligned along the $k_z$-axis. All these systems are topological and are unified on the aspect that their bands possess a vanishing Chern number. The linear response, $\sigma_{zz}$, is obtained from an exact solution when the systems are subjected to collinear electric and magnetic fields applied along the anisotropy axis, viz. $\boldsymbol{\hat z}$. The nonlinear part involves third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the electrical current to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field. We analyse the similarities of the response arising from the vortex nodal-rings and the Hopf semimetals, which can be traced to the dipole-like sources in their BC fields.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izaro Fernandez-Iriondo, Antonio Jimenez-Marin, Jesus Cortes, Pablo Villegas</p>
            <p>Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.</p>

            <p>The role of absorption in 3D electron diffraction is established through analytical theory, simulation, and dynamical refinement. A two-beam expression for the absorbed integrated intensity is derived, showing that for $t/\xi_g \ll 1$ reflections follow a uniform exponential decay set by the mean absorptive potential $U_0'$. Many-beam simulations demonstrate that neglecting absorption in dynamical refinement of integrated intensities incurs a residual that increases linearly with thickness and diverges near zone axes. Dynamical refinements were performed on CsPbBr$_3$, quartz, and borane, with the inclusion of absorption yielding an improvement in $R_{\mathrm{obs}}$ from $6.4$ to $5.3$ \% for CsPbBr$_3$ and negligible changes for quartz and borane. Absorption is therefore deemed negligible for routine refinement of integrated intensities except in high-$Z$ materials at thicknesses approaching $\xi_g$.</p>

            <p>Topological insulators and skyrmion-hosting, chiral magnetic multilayers are two well-explored areas of modern condensed matter physics, each offering unique advantages for spintronics applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the optimization process for the growth of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$/buffer/[Pt/CoB/Ru]$_{\times N}$ heterostructure that combines these two material classes: the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ epilayer was grown by molecular beam epitaxy before transfer under ultrahigh vacuum to a separate growth chamber where the polycrystalline metallic multilayer was sputter deposited. The structure of the samples was characterized by co-fitted X-ray and polarized neutron reflectometry measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Polarized neutron models and standard magnetometry show that a buffer layer exceeding a critical thickness is required to obtain the desired uniform, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in every magnetic layer in the multilayer. Samples with both Ta and Mo buffers were used requiring thicknesses of 1.5 and 0.9 nm respectively. In minimizing the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ terracing, buffered samples yield well-defined, out-of-plane, magnetic domains suitable for spin-orbit torque induced manipulation as determined by X-ray photoemission electron microscopy.</p>

In addition, the toolkit incorporates functionality for solving the standard Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for fermions, extending its applicability to other physical systems such as superconductors. The code is implemented in C with GPU acceleration and is optimized for hybrid CPU/GPU execution on modern high-performance computing platforms. It ensures scalability on leadership-class supercomputers, enabling fully three-dimensional simulations with large atomic numbers, and allows for direct benchmarks of ultracold-atom experimental setups.

This formulation allows macroscopic observables in space-time, such as the total jam delay and jam relaxation time, as well as microscopic jam statistics, to be expressed in terms of geometric properties of the height function. We thereby derive the associated scaling forms and recover the critical exponents previously observed in numerical studies.

            <p>Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.</p>

            <p>Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.</p>

Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-this http URL^-3 and 16 J.g^-1.

Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials.</p>

            <p>We study sample-efficient molecular optimization under a limited budget of oracle evaluations. We propose MolLIBRA (MultimOdaLity and Language Integrated Bayesian and evolutionaRy optimizAtion), a genetic algorithm based framework that pre-ranks candidate molecules using multiple critics before oracle calls: (i) an ensemble of Gaussian process (GP) surrogates defined over multiple molecular fingerprints and (ii) a pretrained text-molecule aligned encoder CLAMP. The GP ensemble enables adaptive selection of task-appropriate fingerprints, while CLAMP provides a zero-shot scoring signal from task descriptions by measuring the similarity between molecular and text embeddings. On the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark with a budget of 1,000 evaluations (PMO-1K), MolLIBRA-L, our variant with a language-model-based candidate generator, attains the best Top-10 AUC on 14/22 tasks and the highest overall sum of Top-10 AUC across tasks among prior methods.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Bartsch, Yuhan Gai, Sakura Schafer-Nameki</p>
            <p>In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</p>

The g factors of several crystal-field doublets of Pr3+ were determined. The crystal-field calculations performed using the exchange-charge model and high-resolution spectroscopy data allowed us to obtain a physically reasonable set of crystal-field parameters. The observed splitting of a number of doublets in zero magnetic field is explained by the presence of random lattice deformations. Simulation of the profiles of observed deformational doublets was carried out taking into account both hyperfine and electron-deformation interactions. The width of the distribution function of random strains was estimated. The main sources of random strains in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+ crystals are discussed.</p>

            <p>The seminal 2009 paper by Bernard, Krauth, and Wilson marked a paradigm shift in Monte Carlo sampling. By abandoning the restrictive condition of detailed balance in favor of the more fundamental principle of global balance, they introduced the Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm, which achieves rejection-free, deterministic sampling for hard spheres. This breakthrough demonstrated that persistent, directional dynamics could dramatically accelerate equilibration in dense particle systems. In this commentary, we review this foundational work and elucidate its underlying mechanism using the broader Event-Driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) framework developed in subsequent years. We show how the original hard-sphere concept naturally generalizes to continuous potentials and modern lifted Markov chain formalisms, transforming a surprising specific result into a powerful general class of sampling algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Efficient, Equivariant Predictions of Distributed Charge Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D. Boittier, Markus Meuwly</p>
            <p>A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or {\sigma}-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles. Overall, DCM-net offers a fast and physically meaningful approach to generating distributed charge models for running pure ML or mixed ML/MM based molecular simulations. level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e).</p>

            <p>On the contrary to the common intuition that a steep expulsive potential makes quantum states widely delocalized, we demonstrate that one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Schrödinger equations, which include expulsive potentials that are \emph{steeper than the quadratic} (anti-harmonic-oscillator) ones, give rise to \emph{normalizable} (effectively localized) eigenstates. These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value.</p>

            <p>Deploying fibrous membranes for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) on large and irregular surfaces is highly desirable but remains challenging, owing to the slow deposition rates and the need for electrically conductive substrates in conventional electrospinning. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput in-situ strategy for fabricating nanocomposite PDRC fibrous membranes via solution blow spinning. This method achieves deposition rates 8-12 times faster than electrospinning and can be applied directly onto nonplanar, nonconductive objects. The resulting membranes, composed of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) fibers embedded with Y2O3 nanoparticles, achieve sub-ambient cooling of up to 7.0 °C outdoors, effectively delaying ice melting. Moreover, they are fully recyclable through simple cleaning, dissolution, and reprocessing. This scalable and sustainable fabrication route provides a versatile and practical platform for integrating PDRC fibrous membranes across diverse surfaces, paving the way toward real-world thermal management applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saima Bashir, Muzaffar Qadir Lone, Prince A Ganai</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of a dressed qubit implemented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites with each site strongly coupled to a bath of phonons. We employ Lang-Firsov transformation to make the problem tractable perturbatively. Applying time-convolutionless master equation within the polaron frame, we investigate decoherence dynamics of the dressed qubit within the singlet-triplet basis of the system for a wide range of bath spectral densities. It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths. Systems coupled to sub-Ohmic baths, whether both or in combination with another type, display pronounced memory effects at relatively small values of couplings. In contrast, combinations involving Ohmic and super-Ohmic baths exhibit noticeable non-Markovianity only at higher couplings.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.</p>

            <p>Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runkai Feng, Jie Shen, Haijun Yu</p>
            <p>The Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic (FENE) dumbbell model is a widely used mathematical model for complex fluids. Direct simulation of the FENE Fokker--Planck equation is computationally challenging due to high dimensionality and singularity of its potential. In this paper, we develop two fast Jacobi-Spherical Harmonic spectral methods for the spatially homogeneous FENE Fokker--Planck equation. These methods effectively resolve the singularity near the boundary by combining properly designed Jacobi polynomials with a weighted variational formulation. A semi-implicit backward differentiation formula of second-order (BDF2) is employed for time marching, and its energy stability is rigorously proved. The resulting linear algebraic system possesses a sparse structure and can be efficiently solved. Numerical results verify the spectral convergence and efficiency of the direct spectral solvers, establishing them as a reliable tool for generating reference solutions for challenging benchmark problems. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we compare several closure approximation models, including the industry workhorse Peterlin approximation (FENE-P), the quasi-equilibrium approximation (FENE-QE), and a novel neural network implementation for FENE-QE proposed in this paper (FENE-QE-NN). Numerical experiments in extensional and shear flows demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods compared to traditional approaches.</p>

            <p>Superconducting microcalorimeters, such as superconducting transition-edge sensors and magnetic microcalorimeters, have emerged as state-of-the-art detectors for x-ray emission spectroscopy by combining near-unity quantum efficiency with excellent energy resolution. Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Fu Zhu, Guo-Zhu Liu, Xufen Wu, Ye-Fei Yuan</p>
            <p>The hyperon puzzle refers to the challenge of reconciling the existence of hyperons in neutron star cores and the observed high masses of neutron stars. The recent discovery of PSR J0952-0607 ($2.35\pm0.17 M_{\odot}$) has intensified this challenge. Existing solutions fail to achieve such a high mass, and often predict unrealistically fast cooling that is at odds with observations. Here, we propose a novel solution to the hyperon puzzle. Using the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, we incorporate the quantum many-body effects caused by strong baryon-meson interactions into the equation of state for cold baryonic matter and find it stiff enough to support a maximum hyperon-star mass of $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 2.59 M_{\odot}$, which can explain all the observed high neutron-star masses. The resulting proton and hyperon fractions are remarkably low, thus the nucleonic and hyperonic direct Urca processes are significantly suppressed. As a result, fast cooling typically does not occur in ordinary neutron stars.</p>

            <p>Collective motion in fish schools exemplifies emergent self-organization in active matter systems, yet computational tools for simulating and analyzing these dynamics remain fragmented across research groups. We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P < 0.1$ and OSI $\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware. NetCDF4 output ensures interoperability with oceanographic analysis tools.

            <p>We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.</p>

This growth can be attributed to its fundamental appeal and the unique opportunities it offers for unconventional control of light, promising innovations in next-generation photonic devices. At the heart of topological photonics lies the one-dimensional (1D) SSH model. Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond. In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of topological photonics in one-dimensional (1D) settings. After briefly introducing paradigmatic 1D models, including the SSH, Rice-Mele, and AAH models, we review recent advances in experimental studies and applications of topological photonics based on 1D platforms. Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model. Towards the end, we summarize the chapter and provide a list of key contributions, together with an outlook on possible future directions in 1D topological photonics.

            <p>Contact electrification (CE) remains a critical challenge in advanced material technologies where uncontrolled surface charging can compromise manufacturability, reliability, and performance in practical applications. Ultrathin glass with micrometer-scale thickness is a state-of-the-art specialty oxide material for flexible touchscreens in next-generation electronic devices. Here, we visualize and quantify CE-induced surface charges on ultrathin glass using sideband-mode Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Nanoscale atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes are used to scan and induce triboelectric charges on stand-alone glass surfaces under ultra-pure N$_2$ conditions. Time-dependent measurements reveal that surface charges on a 30~$\mu$m-thick glass sample decay from 4.47~V to 0.37~V over 240~minutes. Furthermore, electrostatic charges are found to exhibit capacitor-like discharging behavior primarily through the bulk material, yielding a long relaxation time constant of approximately 41~minutes. This behavior differs from the lateral surface discharging observed in thermally grown SiO$2$ thin films reported previously. A self-capacitance analytical model is developed to estimate the corresponding surface charge density ($\sigma$), yielding comparable values of 136.26~$\pm$~16.25~$\mu$C/m$^2$ at 30~$\mu$m and 131.44~$\pm$~28.41~$\mu$C/m$^2$ at 100~$\mu$m. Additionally, external bias applied to AFM tips can be used to enhance, suppress, or invert the intrinsic CE response of glass materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunn Kim</p>
            <p>Although the Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, its underlying mechanisms remain largely heuristic and lack a unified physical theory. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework for information dynamics, treating the attention mechanism as a physical system governed by the principle of least action rather than as an algorithmic optimization. By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat. Finally, we discuss how rotational symmetry breaking in the attention manifold generates massless Goldstone bosons, providing a field-theoretic perspective on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE).

            <p>Development of quantum light sources and search for quantum systems capable of supporting collective many-body states are crucial for further progress of modern quantum technologies. Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.</p>

            <h2>High-resolution numerical simulations of turbulent non-catalytic reverse water gas shift</h2>

            <p>A green transition in aviation requires a drastic upscaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept. The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion. It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction.</p>

            <h2>Mellin-Space Prony Representability of Linear Viscoelastic Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimiter Prodanov</p>
            <p>Linear viscoelasticity is universally described by relaxation functions, which are continuous in relaxation times. Yet experimentally, measurements are necessarily discrete and band-limited, creating a fundamental gap between the continuous mathematical description and empirical observations. While Laplace-domain rational moduli admit finite Prony representations, using Mellin space analysis requires a deeper structural criterion. This work proves that finite Prony series representation holds if and only if the arithmetic pole lattices of Gamma factors in the Mellin transform of the complex modulus align exactly with those of a trial kernel, with residues satisfying decoupled first-order recurrences along aligned sublattices. This maximal criterion classifies classical models (Maxwell, standard linear solid) as finitely representable and fractional models (power-law, Cole--Cole, Zener, Gaussian) as transcendentally representable via infinite Prony ladders, yielding a complete analytical pole-lattice taxonomy of viscoelastic material models.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Protein Evolution via Generative Inference From Monte Carlo Chains to Population Genetics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Di Bari, Thierry Mora, Andrea Pagnani, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Francesco Zamponi, Saverio Rossi</p>
            <p>Generative models derived from large protein sequence alignments define complex fitness landscapes, but their utility for accurately modeling non-equilibrium evolutionary dynamics remains unclear. In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Renormalization Group from a Few-Body Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Tajima, Masaya Nakagawa, Haozhao Liang, Masahito Ueda</p>
            <p>Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shabeeb Ameen, Kyungeun Kim, Ligesh Theeyancheri, Minh Thanh, Mingming Wu, Alison E. Patteson, J. M. Schwarz, Tao Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding how cells escape from embedded spheroids requires a mechanical framework linking stress generation within cells, across cells, and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We analyze maximum shear stress in solid-like and fluid-like spheroids: solid-like spheroids exhibit broader stress distributions and radial stress gradients, while fluid-like spheroids show lower stresses with weak spatial organization. Cell shape anisotropy is not generically aligned with principal stress directions, indicating that morphology alone is an unreliable proxy for mechanical state. We further demonstrate strain stiffening at the single-cell level, where elongation produces nonlinear increases in maximum shear stress, allowing boundary cells in otherwise low-stress, fluid-like spheroids to transiently generate forces sufficient to remodel the matrix. To connect strain-induced stress amplification to invasion modes, we introduce an extended 3D vertex model with explicit, tunable cell-cell adhesion springs. In this minimal mechanical framework, single-cell breakout results from strain stiffening combined with reduced adhesion, whereas multi-cell streaming additionally requires anisotropic adhesion strengthened along the elongation axis and weakened orthogonally. Together, these results identify distinct mechanical pathways coupling cell strain, stress amplification, and adhesion organization to spheroid invasion.</p>

            <h2>Germanium Thermophotovoltaic Devices Achieving 7.3% Efficiency Under High-Temperature Emission by Empirical Calorimetry</h2>

            <p>We report the first empirical efficiency measurement of germanium-based thermophotovoltaic devices under high-temperature, high-irradiance conditions using a high view-factor calorimetric setup. Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge.</p>

            <p>We report an implementation of spin-acoustic resonance in pentacene thin films integrated on a high-quality-factor (high-Q) surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator on a lithium niobate substrate. Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control.</p>

            <h2>Cutting Through the Noise: On-the-fly Outlier Detection for Robust Training of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Terry C. W. Lam, Niamh O'Neill, Christoph Schran, Lars L. Schaaf</p>
            <p>The accuracy of machine learning interatomic potentials suffers from reference data that contains numerical noise. Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes.</p>

            <p>A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in the range 22-25% is estimated. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirms that the Cl-related center is spin active and stable at room temperature with the zero-field splitting in the range of 1.0-1.4 GHz. The combined optical and spin properties suggest this center to be a highly promising candidate for scalable quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Coplanar waveguide resonators are central to the thriving field of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Recently, we have demonstrated the generation of a broadband microwave-frequency comb spectrum using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. Here, the frequency comb is used to spectroscopically probe a bank of coplanar microwave resonators, inductively coupled to a common transmission line, a standard circuit with a variety of applications. We compare the resonator line shape obtained from signals synthesized at room temperature using conventional electronics with the radiation produced in the cryogenic environment by our source, showing substantial equivalence in the estimation of the resonator quality factors. To measure non-uniformly spaced resonant frequencies, we drive the generator with a bi-chromatic tone to generate intermodulation products. Such a dense frequency comb spectrum enables simultaneous addressing of a few resonators via frequency multiplexing. Finally, we discuss the criteria for achieving effective spectroscopic coverage of a given frequency bandwidth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saman Seifi, David Salac</p>
            <p>We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets can generate a transverse electrical response known as the anomalous Hall effect, even though they possess almost no net magnetization. The microscopic origin of this behaviour, however, has remained unclear because conventional measurement geometries mix different contributions to the measured response. Here, we show that applying magnetic fields in selected in-plane directions allows us to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the Hall effect in a representative noncollinear antiferromagnet. By suppressing any dipole-related signal, we isolate a purely octupole-driven Hall response that exhibits a characteristic three-fold angular symmetry. At low magnetic fields, we further observe an additional Hall-like contribution that arises from the scalar spin chirality associated with noncoplanar spin textures. Combining symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and transport measurements, we reveal that octupole order, dipole moments, and chirality coexist and contribute in distinct field regimes. These findings establish a framework for identifying and controlling complex magnetic order parameters for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of a quench from a one-dimensional gas with strong and repulsive local interactions to a strongly attractive one, known as the super-Tonks-Girardeau effect. By incorporating both an optical lattice and non-local interactions (specifically nearest-neighbor), we discover a previously unexplored phenomenon: the disruption of the state during the quench, but within a specific range of interactions. Our study employs the extended Bose-Hubbard model across various system sizes, starting with analytical results for two atoms and progressing to few-body systems using exact diagonalization, DMRG and TDVP methods. Finally, we use a numerical implementation of the local density approximation for a macroscopic number of atoms. Consistently, our findings unveil a region where the initially self-bound structure expands due to the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench. The fast evaporation provides a tool to characterize the phase diagram in state-of-art experiments exploring the physics of the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>We theoretically and numerically investigate the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model with the $\mu(I)$-rheology. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are in quantitative agreement. The granular flow exhibits two distinct regions: a surface flow layer and a static flow regime corresponding to rigid rotation near the drum bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a weak dependence on the angular velocity of the drum. Using dimensional analysis of the continuum equations, we analytically identify nondimensional parameters for the velocity profile and the surface flow layer thickness, which lead to scaling laws characterising the flow in rotating drums with low Froude number and large system size. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed by numerical simulations.</p>

Our approach allows in-situ calibration of the sample's circuit parameters and provides isolation from measurement back-action effects. We measure the radiation temperature of the anomalous metal, and find that it is hotter than both the quantum-critical and insulating regimes. We further show that the anomalous-metallic regime is more susceptible to additional heating than other regimes, explaining its emergence in otherwise thermalized systems. Turning to the quantum-critical regime, we discover nonlinear scaling of radiative noise with applied bias, consistent with theoretical predictions of universal non-equilibrium behavior at quantum critical points.</p>

            <p>Glasses encode the memory of any thermo-mechanical treatment applied to them. This ability is associated to the existence of a myriad of metastable amorphous states which can be probed through different experimental pathways. It is usually assumed that this memory can be erased in the supercooled liquid, and that this process occurs on a time scale controlled by the {\alpha}-relaxation. We find that this assumption does not apply for hydrostatically compressed glasses. Annealing under pressure a prototypical metallic glass can irreversibly modify its dynamics, thermodynamics and structure, reduce the atomic mobility and lead to structural modifications of the first coordination shells which reduce the thermal stability with respect to a glass annealed in absence of pressure. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid, implying the existence of an additional process, beyond the {\alpha}-relaxation, contributing to the equilibrium recovery of the material. These results establish pressure as a powerful tool for engineering non-equilibrium glassy materials with tailored properties, while deepening our understanding of relaxation dynamics in disordered systems under extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. Here, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can act as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the formation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the development of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary plane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying chemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that extends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying. By examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both the interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane govern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical domain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of interface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for experimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.</p>

            <p>Photo-plasticity in semiconductors, wherein their mechanical properties such as strength, hardness and ductility are influenced by light exposure, has been reported for several decades. Although such phenomena have drawn significant attention for the manufacturability and usage of deformable semiconductor devices, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of direct evidence. Here we provide experimental observation and atomic insights into the reduced mobility of dislocations in zinc sulfide, as a model material, under light. Using photo-nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy, we observe that dislocations glide shorter distances under light than those in darkness and there are no apparent deformation twins in both conditions. By atomic-scale simulations, we demonstrate that the decreased dislocation mobility is attributed to the increased Peierls stress for dislocation motion and enhanced stress fields around dislocation cores due to photoexcitation. This study improves the understanding of photo-plastic effects in inorganic semiconductors, offering the opportunities for modulating their mechanical properties using light.</p>

            <p>Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-1 chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we identify a manifold consisting of the two lowest-lying, spin-singlet states isolated from doublet states of opposite fermion parity, which undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random Zeeman and/or spin-orbit coupling. Despite the unavoidable effect of quasiparticle poisoning on qubit performance, the isolation of the singlet states offers additional protection. In addition, we introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</p>

The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p>

In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates, superconductivity with a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ exceeding 80 and 40~K has been respectively realised in pressurized bulk crystals and epitaxially strained thin films. These advancements call for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters in these new materials platforms of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64~T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300~K. We find that the normal state of thin-film LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi-liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state therein. Our results demonstrate that thin-film LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}$ scaling observed across a myriad of strongly correlated superconductors and establish key normal-state characteristics of strained bilayer superconducting nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Resolving the problem of complex sound velocity in binary Bose mixtures with attractive intercomponent interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdulla Rakhimov, Sanathon Tukhtasinova, Vyacheslav I. Yukalov</p>
            <p>In 2015 Dmitry Petrov theoretically suggested that, in a binary mixture of bosons a quantum liquid droplet may arise due to the competition between attractive intercomponent and repulsive intracomponent forces. Although this prediction has been confirmed experimentally, the model by itself suffers from a serious conceptual problem: The low - lying excitation spectrum manifests a purely imaginary phonon velocity, $c_d^2 < 0$. In the present work, we develop a self consistent theory of two-component Bose systems with attractive interspecies interactions, which accurately takes into account pair correlations in terms of anomalous and mixed densities. We have shown that this procedure is able to resolve the problem of $c_d^2 < 0$. Limiting ourselves with a symmetric Bose mixture at zero temperature, we have found a region of stability in which a droplet can survive.</p>

            <p>Positional polymorphism in solids refers to locally disordered unit cells that, on average, reproduce the high-symmetry structures observed in diffraction experiments. Standard theories of electron-phonon interactions fail to describe the temperature-dependent electronic structure of such polymorphous systems. Hybrid halide perovskites are a prime example, where configurational entropy from both polymorphism and molecular disorder plays a central role. Here we generalize the special displacement method to polymorphous crystals, providing an efficient ab initio framework for electron-phonon couplings without resorting to molecular dynamics. We resolve long-standing discrepancies in hybrid halide perovskite physics, including temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons and band gaps. Our approach provides a practical route to link local disorder, configurational entropy, and electron-phonon interactions, with applicability across diverse material classes, from optoelectronics and ferroelectrics to thermoelectrics.</p>

            <h2>Roadmap for electronic structure, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon calculations in locally disordered inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios Zacharias, George Volonakis, Laurent Pedesseau, Claudine Katan, Feliciano Giustino, Jacky Even</p>
            <p>The role of data in modern materials science becomes more valuable and accurate when effects such as electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are included, providing a more realistic representation of finite-temperature material behavior. Furthermore, positional polymorphism, characterized by correlated local atomic disorder usually not reported by standard diffraction techniques, is a critical yet underexplored factor in understanding the electronic structure and transport properties of energy-efficient materials, like halide perovskites. In this manuscript, we present a first-principles methodology for locally disordered (polymorphous) cubic inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites, rooted in the special displacement method, that offers a systematic and alternative approach to molecular dynamics for exploring finite-temperature properties. By enabling a unified and efficient treatment of anharmonic lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and positional polymorphism, our approach generates essential data to predict temperature-dependent phonon properties, free energies, band gaps, and effective masses. Designed with a high-throughput spirit, this framework has been applied across a range of inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites: CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsPbCl3, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MASnI3, MAPbCl3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FASnI3, and FAPbCl3. We provide a comprehensive comparison between theoretical and experimental results and we systematically uncover trends and insights into their electronic and thermal behavior. For all compounds, we demonstrate strong and consistent correlations between local structural disorder, band gap openings, and effective mass enhancements.</p>

            <h2>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rule Yi, Violet Williams, Benedetta Flebus</p>
            <p>Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, which persist at finite temperature. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate modes with noncollinear polarizations and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. Using a minimal model, we provide an intuitive picture of this phenomenon in terms of beating between linearly polarized modes, which generates a finite instantaneous angular momentum while remaining symmetry-forbidden in the mean. We further show that these vacuum fluctuations give rise to distinct finite-frequency spectral signatures and outline a concrete route for their detection using time-resolved spectroscopic probes sensitive to lattice polarization and symmetry. Our results identify a previously unexplored regime of lattice dynamics, revealing that even the symmetric phonon vacuum can harbor structured, dynamical angular-momentum correlations.</p>

            <p>We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</p>

            <p>We uncover a chain of nonlinear modal interactions in softly clamped nanostring resonators. The process involves the sequential coupling of five mechanical modes, during frequency sweeps, yielding a broad nonlinear response with nearly constant amplitude. We demonstrate that soft clamping enables this cascaded energy transfer and amplifies the effective geometric nonlinearity of the driven mode by an order of magnitude. Analytical and finite element-based reduced-order models capture the key features of the coupling cascade and clarify its underlying mechanism. The phenomenon is generic in nonlinear vibrational systems and can be tailored through soft-clamping design strategies.</p>

            <h2>Periodically forced pinned anharmonic atom chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Darshan, Alessandra Iacobucci, Stefano Olla, Gabriel Stoltz</p>
            <p>Recent works proved a hydrodynamic limit for periodically forced atom chains with harmonic interaction and pinning, together with momentum flip. When energy is the only conserved quantity, one would expect similar results in the anharmonic case, as conjectured for the temperature profile and energy flux in arXiv:2212.00093. However, outside the harmonic case, explicit computations are generally no longer possible, thus making a rigorous proof of this hydrodynamic limit difficult. Consequently, we numerically investigate the plausibility of this limit for the particular case of a chain with $\beta$-FPUT interactions and harmonic pinning. We present our simulation results suggesting that the conjectured PDE for the limiting temperature profile and Green--Kubo type formula for the limiting energy current conjectured in arXiv:2212.00093 are correct. We then use this Green--Kubo type formula to investigate the relationship between the energy current and period of the forcing. This relationship is investigated in the case of significant rate of momentum flip, small rate of momentum flip and no momentum flip. We compare the relationship observed in the anharmonic case to that of the harmonic case for which explicit formulae are available.</p>

            <p>Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</p>

            <p>The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.</p>

            <h2>Minimal Theory of Strange Carriers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Fratini</p>
            <p>I explore a theory of transport and optical properties of strange metallic carriers in strongly correlated systems that follows from assuming that the diffusion constant has reached its quantum limit $D=\hbar/m$, and that such quantum carriers behave as distinguishable particles as they would in an electronic solid. These assumptions immediately lead to $T$-linear resistivities with apparent Planckian scattering rates and, extending to the frequency domain, to the stretched Drude peaks and $\omega/T$ scaling commonly observed in optical absorption experiments in strange metals. This behavior can be rationalized by observing that when the thermal de Broglie length $\lambda_{dB}$ exceeds the mean-free-path, the carrier motion can no longer be described in terms of random collisions of classical particles as assumed by Drude-Boltzmann theory and should be viewed instead as a sequence of projective measurements collapsing the wavefunction.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Super-ballistic Brownian Motion in Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason Boynewicz, Michael C. Thumann, Mark G. Raizen</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is a foundational physical process characterized by a mean squared displacement that scales linearly in time in thermal equilibrium, known as diffusion. At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as t^2. This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t^(5/2). This result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a non-zero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on non-zero initial velocities. These results are a step towards the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids.</p>

            <p>Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. MLIPs trained on coupled-cluster data, particularly CCSD(T), have emerged as a promising route to achieve chemical accuracy beyond the limits of density functional theory (DFT) and to incorporate non-empirical van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Most existing approaches are, however, still not straightforwardly applicable for systems with extended covalent networks such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to the limited availability of CCSD(T) for periodic systems. Here we present a methodology to train MLIPs with CCSD(T) accuracy for these systems. The approach uses the {\Delta}-learning method with a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline. This strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability toward the periodic systems. Dispersion interactions are accounted for by adding vdW-bound multimers in the training set, and the combination with a vdW-aware tight-binding baseline allows the formally local MLIP to attain CCSD(T)-level accuracy even for systems dominated by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional COF composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. The developed methodology opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations for systems with extended covalent networks and vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.</p>

By incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation theorems.

            <p>Predicting optoelectronic properties of large-scale atomistic systems under realistic conditions is crucial for rational materials design, yet computationally prohibitive with first-principles simulations. Recent neural network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding, but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property prediction in large, complex systems.</p>

            <p>Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that the zero indirect band gap in the real part of the spectrum remains stable in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the parameter regime in which this robustness persists. We find that the appearance of the zero indirect gap coincides with the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the magnetic ground state of CuNdO$_2$, which is a delafossite with a triangular lattice of magnetic Nd$^{3+}$ ions that are well separated by non-magnetic Cu spacer layers. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the crystal electric field, we determine the strong Ising character of the pseudo-spin 1/2 Nd$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T_N=0.78$ K. While the magnetic transition is definitively observed with muon spin relaxation, accompanied by the formation of a weakly dispersing spin wave excitation, no dipole-ordered moment is detected with neutron diffraction. We show that the apparent absence of a dipolar ordered moment is a consequence of the dominant Ising character of the antiferromagnetically coupled Nd$^{3+}$ moments, which experience extreme frustration on the triangular lattice. Consequently, the frustration in CuNdO$_2$ is relieved through in-plane ordering of the substantially smaller perpendicular component of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments into a 120\textdegree\ structure, with a nearly vanishing ordered moment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.Eisenriegler</p>
            <p>In spin systems such as the Ising model, the local order and disorder can be characterized by the order-parameter and energy density profiles $\langle \sigma ({\bf r}_1) \rangle$ and $\langle \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle$, respectively. Does increasing the order at ${\bf r}_1$ always decrease the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$? Does increasing the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$ always decrease the order at ${\bf r}_1$? The answer to these questions is contained in the cumulant response function $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$. This correlation function vanishes in the unbounded bulk but not in systems with fixed-spin boundary conditions. Using the universal operator-product expansion of $\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2)$ and exact results for the Ising model, we analyze $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$ in two-dimensional critical systems defined on the $x-y$ plane with mixed $+$ and $-$ boundary conditions. Particularly interesting behavior is found when either of the operators $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is located on a ``zero line" in the $x-y$ plane, along which $\langle\sigma ({\bf r})\rangle$ vanishes. Results for half-plane, triangular, and rectangular geometries are presented.</p>

            <p>The brownmillerite-type barium indate (Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$) is a potential electrolyte for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Revealing the defect chemistry of this material is key to understanding its ionic and electronic conductivity. In this contribution, we report the existence of oxygen interstitials in a dumbbell configuration, which are also observed in In$_2$O$_3$. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we investigate vacancies, various oxygen interstitials, and Frenkel pairs. In doing so, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure. Our results show that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations exhibit charged states and become the prevailing compensating defects at high oxygen partial pressures, alongside oxygen vacancies. Our results provide a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic defects in barium indate, setting the stage for future investigations of the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</p>

            <p>We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.</p>

Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p>

            <h2>Effect of FABr Over-Stoichiometry on the Morphology and Optoelectronic Properties of Wide-Bandgap FAPbBr_3 Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Ammirati, F. Martelli, F. Toschi, S. Turchini, P. O'Keeffe, A. Paladini, F. Matteocci, J. Barichello, D. Di Girolamo, S. Piccirillo, A. Di Carlo, D. Catone</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the impact of formamidinium bromide (FABr) over-stoichiometry in the precursor solution on the optoelectronic properties and morphology of the resulting films of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr_3). Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells.</p>

            <p>High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance. In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes. Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</p>

            <h2>Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Waves in the Honeycomb Holstein Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangchao Li, Lifei Zhang, Tianxing Ma, Qionglin Dai, Lufeng Zhang</p>
            <p>The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Critical fluctuations of elastic moduli in jammed solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kumpei Shiraishi, Hideyuki Mizuno</p>
            <p>We investigate sample-to-sample fluctuations of the shear modulus in ensembles of particle packings near the jamming transition. Unlike the average modulus, which exhibits distinct scaling behaviours depending on the interparticle potential, the fluctuations obey a critical exponent that is independent of the potential. Furthermore, this scaling behaviour has been confirmed in two-dimensional packings, indicating that it holds regardless of spatial dimension. Using this scaling law, we discuss the relationship predicted by heterogeneous-elasticity theory between elastic-modulus fluctuations and the Rayleigh scattering of sound waves across different pressures. Our numerical results provide a useful foundation for developing a unified theoretical description of the jamming critical phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of Tc in Oxide Superconductors: Double-Bridge Mechanism of High-Tc Superconductivity and Bose-Einstein Condensation of Cooper Pairs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-jie Shi, Juan Du, Yao-hui Zhu</p>
            <p>The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*>Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a<0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.</p>

            <p>Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, leading to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Levchenko, E. Kirkinis, A. V. Andreev</p>
            <p>The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</p>

            <h2>Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Schöttner, Qingguang Xie, Gaurav Nath, Jens Harting</p>
            <p>Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</p>

            <p>Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Additionally, classification models using both random forests and Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated to distinguish between large and small particles. While random forests show moderate performance, LLMs offer no significant advantages under data-scarce conditions. Overall, this study demonstrates that carefully curated small data sets, paired with robust classical ML, can effectively predict the synthesis of Cu NPs and highlights that for lab-scale studies, complex models like LLMs may offer limited benefit over simpler techniques.</p>

            <h2>Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</h2>

            <p>The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality of phase transitions and critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a metamagnetic transition line with a critical endpoint (CEP) and corresponding Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP is located at $\mu_0H_{\mathrm{c}} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_{\mathrm{c}} \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a highly sensitive field dependence in the magnetic cooling near the emergent CEP, characterized by a divergent magnetic Grüneisen ratio following $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with $\beta + \gamma \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK, achieved from the initial condition of 2 K and 4 T. The findings here pave the way for studying supercritical phenomena and magnetic cooling in rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijie Wang, Mazharul M. Islam, David R. Bowler</p>
            <p>We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the energetics, and the atomic and electronic structure, of stacking faults in GaN, both in the stable hexagonal wurtzite (wz) phase and in the metastable cubic zincblende (zb) phase. In wz GaN, SFs on the (0001) planes can be divided into three different intrinsic stacking faults (I1, I2, and I3) and oneextrinsic stacking fault (E). In zb GaN, SFs form along (111) directions, giving one type each of intrinsic, extrinsic and twin SFs. Based on the calculated formation energy, I1 is the most stable SF of wz GaN in agreement with experiment. For zb GaN, the intrinsic stacking fault is the most dominant planar defect. To characterize the effect of the stacking faults on the electronic structure of the material, we examined the band density. We found that the bands near the valence band maximum in wz GaN are localised on the Ga-polar side of the stacking fault (i.e. on the Ga side of the Ga-N bonds perpendicular to the SF), with the bands near the conduction band minimum more on the N-polar side, though somewhat delocalised. We found the opposite trend in zb GaN; this behaviour is caused by a redistribution of charge near the interface. We also show the band offsets for the stacking faults, finding that they are very sensitive to local conditions, but can all be described as type II interfaces, with the presence of a stacking fault reducing the gap locally.</p>

            <p>Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital (LAPW+LO) basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT). Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, and many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Moreover, exciting can handle resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC). Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning (ML). All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientifically relevant materials.</p>

            <p>Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes provide a novel platform for elastic strain engineering, enabling the manipulation of phonon transport free from substrate clamping. In this work, we investigate the thermal transport properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) membranes subjected to self-formed crease induced inhomogeneous strain. By integrating spatially resolved Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) with micro-Raman spectroscopy, we observe a sharp, localized suppression of thermal conductivity (k) in high-curvature regions. Specifically, k is reduced from 4.43 to 3.62 W/(m K) in SrTiO3 and from 2.27 to 1.81 W/(m K) in BaTiO3 at the crease centers, directly correlating with the local strain distribution. First-principles calculations reveal that, unlike uniform strain, the symmetry breaking induced by strain gradients significantly broadens phonon dispersion and enhances scattering rates. These findings not only elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing phonon-strain coupling but also demonstrate the potential of inhomogeneous strain fields as a potent tool for designing dynamic solid-state thermal switches and active thermal management devices.</p>

            <p>We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</p>

            <p>Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuwen Zhang, Fernando P. Sabino, Jia-Xin Xiong, Alex Zunger</p>
            <p>Physical properties intermediate between constituents of alloys can be achieved as downward convex positive bowing, upward concave negative bowing, or zero bowing. Such bowing effects are essential for band gap engineering in semiconductor alloys. Upward band gap bowing effects are rather rare, hindering the exploration on half of the available physical property space of alloys. Part of the this being a rare event is related to the need to stabilize an alloy with low mixing enthalpy, so it does not phase separate. In this paper we find via density functional theory that one can satisfy the simultaneous conditions of negative mixing enthalpy and upward band gap bowing in four-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys in the cubic perovskite structure. Such perovskite alloys have the B-site occupied by a mixture of group IVB and IIB elements that have the IVB-s and IIB-s states in the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively, leaving the delocalized s states strongly repel each other. This s-s repulsion leads to the upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpies simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify a perovskite alloy that has a band gap much larger than all its components. Analogous trends of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy also appear in the corresponding three-component and two-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys. These observations of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy will significantly accelerate the design of stable upward band gap bowing alloys in a broad range of material families.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions driven by electronic correlations are central to understanding the physics of graphene and related two-dimensional materials. A paradigmatic example is the semimetal-to-Mott-insulator transition on the honeycomb lattice, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class, yet consensus on its critical exponents has remained elusive for over a decade due to severe finite-size effects and the absence of rigorous conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</p>

            <p>Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</p>

            <h2>Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pushkar Khandare, Srikanth Sastry</p>
            <p>We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.</p>

We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</p>

What has been missing so far is a general, scalable deep-learning approach that would enable the rapid prediction of spatial densities for strongly correlated systems in arbitrary potentials. In this work, we present a straightforward scheme, where we learn to predict densities using convolutional neural networks trained on random potentials. While we demonstrate this approach in 1D and 2D lattice models using data from numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo, it is directly applicable as well to training data obtained from experimental quantum simulators. We train networks that can predict the densities of multiple observables simultaneously and that can predict for a whole class of many-body lattice models, for arbitrary system sizes. We show that our approach can handle well the interplay of interference and interactions and the behaviour of models with phase transitions in inhomogeneous situations, and we also illustrate the ability to solve inverse problems, finding a potential for a desired density.</p>

            <h2>Revealing effects of local dimension on variable-range interacting model by connecting Lieb-Robinson bounds and multipartite entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keshav Das Agarwal, Debkanta Ghosh, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>A spin-$s$ variable-range interacting Ising model may display qualitatively different behaviors depending on the fall-off rate of the interactions, as already seen in equilibrium studies of spin-1/2 systems. We propose a dynamical method using weighted graph states, generated through time evolution that confirms the existence of the transition point in the fall-off rate for the spin-$s$ Ising model. Moreover, the dependence of local dimension on information spreading and multipartite entanglement profile in this model remains unclear, which we establish here. In particular, our analysis shows that the maximum of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) with the fall-off rate serves as a clear indicator of the information spreading, which aligns with changes in the profile of the Lieb-Robinson bound. Further, in the case of an open chain, the spread of information is related to the divergence in the first derivative of GME. Additionally, we validate this signature by performing a scaling analysis of the time-averaged mutual information.</p>

            <p>A new experimental setup combining X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) in the hard x-ray regime and a high-pressure sample environment is developed to monitor the pressure dependence of the internal motion of complex systems down to the atomic scale in the multi-gigapascal range, from room temperature to 600K. The high flux of coherent high energy x-rays at 4th generation synchrotron source solves the problems caused by the absorption of the Diamond Anvil Cells used to generate the high pressure, enabling the measurement of the intermediate scattering function over 6 orders of magnitude in time, from $10^{-3}$ s to $10^{3}$s. The constraints posed by the high-pressure generation such as the preservation of X-ray coherence, as well as the sample, pressure and temperature stability, are discussed, and the feasibility of high-pressure XPCS is demonstrated through results obtained on metallic glasses.</p>

            <h2>Direct Estimation of the Density of States for Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew L. Goh, Bálint Koczor</p>
            <p>Simulating time evolution is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers and is thus one of the most promising prospects for achieving practical quantum advantage. Here, we develop quantum algorithms to extract thermodynamic properties by estimating the density of states (DOS), a central object in quantum statistical mechanics. We introduce several innovations that significantly improve the practicality and extend the generality of previous techniques. First, our approach allows one to estimate the DOS only for a specific subspace of the full Hilbert space. This is crucial for fermionic systems, since both canonical and grand canonical ensemble thermal equilibrium properties depend on subspaces of fixed number. Second, in our approach, by time evolving very simple, random initial states, such as randomly chosen computational basis states, we can exactly recover the DOS on average. Third, due to circuit-depth limitations, we only reconstruct the DOS up to a convolution with a Gaussian window - thus all imperfections that shift the energy levels by less than the width of the convolution window will not significantly affect the estimated DOS. For these reasons we find the approach is a promising candidate for early quantum advantage as even short-time, noisy dynamics can yield a semi-quantitative reconstruction of the DOS (convolution with a broad Gaussian window), while early fault tolerant devices will likely enable higher resolution DOS reconstruction through longer time evolutions. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach in representative Fermi-Hubbard and spin models and indeed find that our approach is highly robust against algorithmic errors in the time evolution and against gate noise. We further demonstrate that our approach is compatible with NISQ-friendly variational techniques, introducing and leveraging a new technique for variational time evolution.</p>

            <h2>Rare Events and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Nicholas O'Dea, Yaodong Li, Tibor Rakovszky, Vedika Khemani</p>
            <p>The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</p>

            <h2>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Lastres, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya</p>
            <p>An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</p>

            <p>Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high-harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report a similar effect, pronounced ultrafast carrier saturation dynamics and harmonic emission suppression during nonperturbative harmonic generation (NPHG) in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports NPHG at laser intensities as low as $\sim 10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Ultrafast carrier saturation strongly modulates the interplay between interband and intraband currents, a key characteristic of NPHG in Dirac materials. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. The excitation of out-of-equilibrium hot carriers and the concomitant saturation near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our finding reveal that field-driven carrier saturation plays a critical role in gapless solid NPHG. We demonstrate the potential of NPHG and HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering novel opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.</p>

            <h2>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Giorlandino, Sebastian Goldt</p>
            <p>Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronan McElvogue, Andrew K. Mitchell, Gabriel T. Landi, Steve Campbell</p>
            <p>Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Finally, we consider how our results are impacted when the system-environment interaction leads to strict homogenisation. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingze Qiu</p>
            <p>The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengfei Zhang, Shuyan Zhou, Ning Sun</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</p>

            <p>We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$.

Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. Efficient spin injection creates a significant spin accumulation of 20 meV and generates a spin diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect is expected to arise from nonlinear spin-charge interactions in the folded-bilayer graphene channel.

            <p>Self-organized systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. Here, we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of noisy self-organized systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. We illustrate this principle with lattice models whose dynamics is captured by continuum models derived using exact coarse-graining techniques and validated through Dynamical Renormalization Group calculations. The universal bound is saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients, which can be rationalized in the continuum limit upon considering the effects of boundaries on domain wall dynamics. We illustrate how this limit can be bypassed when long-range correlations are present by investigating a wave-pinning model motivated by biological mechanisms. In this class of models, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies fundamental limits for the ability of natural and synthetic microsystems to self-assemble into patterns and rationalizes them on purely information-theoretic grounds.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Circuit Fidelity in Transmon Qubit Rings via Operation Duration Tuning under Strong Connectivity Noise</h2>

            <p>Superconducting transmon qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation, yet they face significant fidelity degradation due to connectivity noise, particularly in the intermediate coupling regime where noise levels are substantial. While prior works suggest that high fidelity requires operating in regimes with strongly suppressed noise, maintaining such conditions under practical experimental constraints remains challenging. To address this, we investigate quantum gate operations in fully connected transmon rings, examining both SWAP and general circuits. Our study reveals that fidelity can be significantly enhanced by tuning gate operation durations, with local maxima emerging even under strong noise conditions. These fidelity enhancements occur consistently across different qubit numbers and operation types, and for specific initial states -- particularly those with favorable symmetry or entanglement properties -- the achieved fidelities approach quantum error correction thresholds. Furthermore, we develop a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts the optimal operation durations for new devices, enabling efficient optimization without extensive experimental simulations. These results provide a pathway toward robust quantum circuit design in noisy experimental environments.</p>

            <h2>Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Del Gaudio, Federico Ghimenti, Surya Ganguli</p>
            <p>We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</p>

            <p>Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</p>

            <p>The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</p>

            <p>Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we provide a step change by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are modelled for an ellipsoidal particle, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. The material permittivity and surface damping providing the best fit are found. The particle aspect ratio is determined with a precision better than 5%, and the size with an impressive precision of 0.1 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength in the medium. Taking them into account improves the shape accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</h2>

            <p>Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within harmonic transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for the transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that switches between the CI-NEB and the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction of energy and force calculations by 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. Calculations of the BC set where a simple switch from the CI-NEB to the MMF method is made when the magnitude of the atomic forces drops below 0.5 eV/AA requires 30% more force calculations than the OCI-NEB algorithm. These results show that an adaptive hybrid method mixing CI-NEB and MMF can be a highly efficient tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</p>

            <p>The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</p>

            <h2>Radial gradient of superionic hydrogen in Earth's inner core</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zepeng Wu, Liangrui Wei, Chen Gao, Shunqing Wu, Renata M. Wentzcovitch, Yang Sun</p>
            <p>Hydrogen is considered a major light element in Earth's core, yet the thermodynamics of its superionic phase and its distribution in the inner core remain unclear. Here, we compute ab initio Gibbs free energies for liquid and superionic hcp and bcc Fe-H phases and construct the superionic-liquid phase diagram over pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Earth's inner core. We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure. This scaling relation further reconciles previously reported discrepancies in partition coefficients among theoretical studies and yields good agreement with available experimental data at low pressures. By applying thermochemical constraints, our free-energy results reveal a radial hydrogen gradient within the inner core. These results demonstrate that compositional gradients of superionic hydrogen in the inner core emerge naturally from equilibrium thermodynamics and suggest a general mechanism governing the depth-dependent distribution of light elements within Earth's inner core.</p>

            <h2>Deep networks learn to parse uniform-depth context-free languages from local statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack T. Parley, Francesco Cagnetta, Matthieu Wyart</p>
            <p>Understanding how the structure of language can be learned from sentences alone is a central question in both cognitive science and machine learning. Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures. Overall, we propose a unifying framework where correlations at different scales lift local ambiguities, enabling the emergence of hierarchical representations of the data.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hantian Zhu, Yixin Zhang, Shang-Shun Zhang, Yang Zhang, Cristian D. Batista</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the infinite-$U$ triangular-lattice Hubbard model supports a superconducting state built from tightly bound Cooper pairs composed of two holes and one magnon ($2h1m$). Building on the seminal prediction of repulsively bound $2h1m$ states, we show that next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{2}$ coherently mixes symmetry-related configurations, stabilizing an $s$-wave bound state with substantial binding energy and a light effective mass. Large-scale DMRG calculations at finite doping identify a magnetization plateau corresponding to a gas of such bound states and quasi--long--range superconducting order with power-law $2h1m$ pair correlations. Our results establish a magnon-mediated superconducting mechanism driven by kinetic frustration, with immediate detectable signatures for moiré Hubbard materials and ultracold-atom simulators.</p>

            <p>Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.</p>

            <p>One of the central questions in cuprate superconductivity is if superconductivity can exist in an isolated single CuO$_2$ plane without any interlayer coupling. There have been numerous experimental efforts to answer this question, but it still has not been clearly resolved. Here we present a heterostructure system with an isolated half-unit-cell La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ which has a single CuO$_2$ plane. Using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the electronic and gap structures of a single CuO$_2$ plane. We observed a \textit{d}-wave-like gap which closes somewhat above the bulk T$_c$. Moreover, almost identical gap properties are seen for both single CuO$_2$ plane and bulk. These observations lead us to the conclusion that the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates also exists in a single CuO$_2$ plane. Our results demonstrate that cuprate superconductivity is essentially a two-dimensional phenomenon and provide a platform to study cuprate superconductivity in a purely two-dimensional system.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moiré superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengyan Darius Shi, Zhaoyu Han, Srinivas Raghu, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\nu=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.</p>

            <p>Analog quantum simulators and digital quantum computers are two distinct paradigms driving near-term applications in modern quantum science, from probing many-body phenomena to identifying computational advantage over classical systems. A transformative opportunity on the horizon is merging the high-fidelity many-body evolution in analog simulators with the robust control and measurement of digital machines. Such a hybrid platform would unlock new capabilities in state preparation, characterization and dynamical control. Here, we embed digital quantum control in the analog evolution of a synthetic quantum material by entangling the lattice potential landscape of a Bose-Hubbard circuit with an ancilla qubit. This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique. This work illustrates the potential for entangling quantum computers with quantum matter -- synthetic and solid-state -- for advantage in sensing and materials characterization.</p>

The leading-order higher-derivative corrections probe gauge theories with non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ at the ultraviolet fixed point, and enable the engineering of diverse temperature and charge density profiles for the viscosities and the conductivity. Our results establish the membrane paradigm in higher-derivative holographic models: all the transport coefficients are extracted from the black brane horizon values of the gravitational scalars, and various functions defining the gravitational holographic dual.</p>

The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models for an arbitrary number of particles.</p>

            <p>Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Batini, Sebastian Erne, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Jürgen Berges</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-trapped state in ultracold atom setups.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiantong Chen, Xuanting Ji, Ya-Wen Sun</p>
            <p>Topological states of matter are characterized by nonlocal structures that are naturally encoded in the quantum entanglement of many-body wavefunctions. Topological semimetals are short-range entangled states at weak coupling and their entanglement structure at strong coupling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.</p>

            <p>Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.</p>

            <p>Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.</p>

However, experimental realizations of the simultaneous microscopic observation of interaction-driven charge order and genuine Mott localization, which are the defining hallmarks of a Wigner-Mott insulator, have remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating state in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered superstructure at one-third filling hosts a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. The spontaneous relaxation from excited states back to the ground state demonstrates that this Wigner-Mott phase is stabilized by the cooperative effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Our results provide direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism and establish 6R-TaS$_2$ as a platform for the controlled realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.</p>

            <p>Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) are complementary, non-destructive techniques that provide rich and distinct insights into the structural and electronic properties of materials. Raman spectroscopy offers detailed information on vibrational modes, phase transitions, temperature, and local stress, while SHG is highly sensitive to symmetry and orientation, particularly in non-centrosymmetric structures. In this work, in addition to combining both techniques, we propose a novel approach to determine the nonlinear optical tensor, leveraging the spatial and ultra-fast temporal offset of a Bessel-Gaussian laser beam at the microscope's focal point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.T. Bagraev, L.E. Klyachkin, A.N. Malyarenko, N.I. Rul'</p>
            <p>Electroluminescence spectra of a silicon nanostructure with edge channels covered by chains of dipole centers with negative correlation energy are demonstrated. The presence of such chains provides conditions for nondissipative transport of single charge carriers at high temperatures up to room temperature. Due to the suppression of the electron-electron interactions, the macroscopic quantum phenomena such as Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations and the quantum staircase of Hall resistance are consistent with the positions of the spectral peaks of the detected electroluminescence. The obtained results are considered in the framework of Faraday electromagnetic induction, which indicates that Landau quantization leads to the emergence of induced irradiation similar to Josephson and Andreev generation. Moreover, the detected maxima in the spectral characteristics correspond to odd fractional values of the resistance quantum staircases, while the dips in the electroluminescence spectra are observed at even fractional values of the resistance quantum ladder, which is due to the increased formation of composite bosons and fermions, respectively.</p>

            <h2>First-Principles AI finds crystallization of fractional quantum Hall liquids</h2>

            <p>When does a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid crystallize? Addressing this question requires a framework that treats fractionalization and crystallization on equal footing, especially in strong Landau-level mixing regime. Here, we introduce MagNet, a self-attention neural-network variational wavefunction designed for quantum systems in magnetic fields on the torus geometry. We show that MagNet provides a unifying and expressive ansatz capable of describing both FQH states and electron crystals within the same architecture. Trained solely by energy minimization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, MagNet discovers topological liquid and electron crystal ground states across a broad range of Landau-level mixing. Our results highlight the power of first-principles AI for solving strongly interacting many-body problems and finding competing phases without external training data or physics pre-knowledge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Patel, Jose D. Mella, S. Puri, Salvador Barraza-Lopez, H. Nakamura</p>
            <p>Homogeneous in-plane biaxial tensile strain strengthens the out-of-plane van der Waals interaction in \MoS\ bilayers (BLs) and can be used to fine-tune their terahertz (THz) oscillations. Using ultralow-frequency Raman spectroscopy on hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (2R) stacked BLs, we observe a hardening of the interlayer breathing modes originating from a strain-induced Poisson contraction of the vdW separation between the layers, and characterized by an effective out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of $\nu_\mathrm{eff} \approx 0.19\text{--}0.24$. Strikingly, this geometric contraction drives the system into a highly repulsive regime of the intermolecular potential, corresponding to a Grüneisen parameter of $\gamma \approx 10\text{--}14$. This value surpasses even the `giant' one reported for phosphorene, establishing these van der Waals BLs as highly tunable nonlinear mechanical platforms that can be addressed at the THz regime, couple strongly with light, and do not need external pressure knobs.</p>

            <p>This work explores a deformation of the Kitaev toric code that induces a phase transition out of the topologically ordered phase. By placing the model on a cylinder, the bulk global 1-form symmetries separate into distinct boundary operators, allowing us to show that the transition is accompanied by the breaking of one higher-form symmetry. Using a holographic $(1+1)$-dimensional boundary Hamiltonian, we extract an effective central charge and find a pronounced suppression near $\beta_c$, followed by its restoration at strong coupling, indicating sensitivity to bulk criticality rather than topological order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jane Schlesinger, Simon Hjaltason, Nathan J. Szymanski, Christopher J. Bartel</p>
            <p>Machine learning models have recently emerged to predict whether hypothetical solid-state materials can be synthesized. These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).</p>

            <h2>Universal Quantized Berry-Dipole Flat Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyang Mo, Shuang Zhang</p>
            <p>Perfectly flat bands with nontrivial quantum geometry have emerged as a frontier for exotic topological phenomena and superconductors. Here, we unveil a universal family of quantized Berry-dipole flat bands in chiral-symmetric (2n+1)-band systems, where the central perfectly flat band carries a Berry-dipole moment d=n, with n an arbitrary integer, while preserving zero Chern number. We construct explicit lattice models to showcase three topological phenomena characterized by the Berry-dipole moment: a flat-band returning pump featuring bidirectional, soliton-like displacement of Wannier centers by exactly n unit cells per half cycle, a dipolar Haldane phase diagram arising from the competition between time-reversal and parity symmetries, and n pairs of bulk helical zero modes whose existence depends on the orientation of pseudomagnetic field. Our findings establish a universal framework for the topology beyond Chern class in perfectly flat bands and provide a tunable platform for exploring quantum geometry and interaction-driven phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binchang Zhou, Baoru Pan, Pan Zhou, Yuzhong Hu, Songmin Liu, Lizhong Sun</p>
            <p>The Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE), which generates spin accumulation under an applied electric current, quantifies charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) efficiency in non-centrosymmetric systems. However, systematic investigations of REE in two-dimensional (2D) materials remain scarce. To address this gap, we perform a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the 80 crystallographic layer groups, elucidating the relationship between materials' symmetries and the geometric characteristics of the REE response tensor. Our analysis identifies 13 distinct symmetry classes for the tensor and reveals all potential material candidates. Considering the requirement of strong spin-orbit coupling for a large REE response, we screen the C2DB database and identify 54 promising 2D materials. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the largest REE response coefficients in these materials exceed those reported for other 2D systems by an order of magnitude, indicating exceptionally high CSC efficiency. Focusing on three representative materials, including HgI2, AgTlP2Se6 and BrGaTe, we show that their large response coefficients can be well explained by effective kp models and the characteristic spin textures around high-symmetry points in momentum space. This work provides a systematic framework and identifies high-performance candidates, paving the way for future exploration of REE-driven CSC in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>The discovery of fractional charge excitations in new platforms offers crucial insights into strongly correlated quantum phases. While a range of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have recently been observed in two-dimensional twisted moire systems, the theoretically anticipated filling factor v = -1/3 FQAH state has remained elusive, with debates centering on its nature of charge density wave or a topological Chern insulator. Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field. The corresponding Curie temperatures are approximately 11 K, 3.5 K, and 2.4 K, respectively. The -1/3 state emerges over a narrower electric field range and a lower temperature compared to the integer and other fractional states, indicating its fragile nature that may lead to its absence in previous reports. Notably, the PL spectra at v = -1/3 disperse as the out-of-plane magnetic field increases, consistent with a nontrivial topological origin. Theoretical calculations based on the exact diagonalization method further support the interpretation of this topologically non-trivial state.</p>

            <p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate deep learning with physical prior knowledge, have proven to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The present work utilizes PINNs to analyze the existence and evolution of quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), revealing the ability of this technique to accurately predict structural features of the QDs, their multipeak profiles, and dynamical behavior. The stable evolution of multipole QDs is thus demonstrated. Comparing different network architectures, including the training time, loss values, and $\mathbb{L_{2}}$ error, PINNs accurately predict specific dynamical characteristics of QDs. Furthermore, the PINN robustness is evaluated by the application of PINN to parameter-discovery tasks, considering both clean training data and data contaminated by $1\%$ random noise. The results highlight the efficiency of PINNs in modeling complex quantum systems and extracting reliable parameters under the noisy conditions.</p>

            <h2>Spin-momentum Locking and Topological Vector Charge Response with Conserved Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonseok Hwang, Penghao Zhu, Taylor L. Hughes</p>
            <p>Spin-momentum locking plays a fundamental role in spintronics and, more broadly, is an important concept in condensed matter physics. In 2D and 3D, spin-momentum locking typically does not allow spin-conservation because the spin-1/2 operators of electrons anticommute. Instead, here we study spin-momentum locking terms with conserved, commuting pseudospins built from a combination of spin and orbitals. We find that 2D spin-momentum locking terms with conserved pseudospins generally lead to linearly dispersing modes at low-energy with anomalous charge and pseudospin currents. To cure the anomaly we show that such anomalous modes can be realized on the surface of a 3D Weyl semimetal (or an associated weak topological insulator) with a nonzero mixed spin-momentum quadrupole moment, which is determined by the momentum location and pseudospin eigenvalues of Weyl points at the Fermi level. Crucially, this mixed quadrupole moment captures a mixed pseudospin-charge bulk response that cancels the anomaly of surface modes, and can generate a giant 3D spin Hall effect, among other phenomena.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, R. Y. Fang, S. L. Zhang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>We report a fully self-consistent calculation of the complex renormalization by exchange interactions and hence the complete phase diagram of conventional $s$-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities as well as the related physical properties including the optical response. We show that a small amount of magnetic disorder can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state, where the single-particle excitation gap vanishes whereas the superconducting order parameter $\Delta_0$ remains finite. In this phase, the linear optical conductivity exhibits a finite absorption over the low-frequency regime, particularly for photon energies below the conventional threshold $2|\Delta_0|$, even at low temperatures, in sharp contrast to the gapped state. The nonlinear response, however, remains coherent and is dominated by the Higgs-mode dynamics rather than gapless quasiparticle background. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between dissipative single-particle excitations and coherent collective dynamics of the condensate, a feature likely general to other gapless superconductors, and introduces a fundamentally different detection scheme, using THz spectroscopy to probe the signatures of Shiba states.</p>

            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We show that both the topological (MZMs and MPMs) and trivial (TZMs and TPMs) edge modes are robust against onsite disorder. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.</p>

We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.</p>

            <p>A variety of experimental observations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with Ising spin-orbit coupling suggest the presence of an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. Some of these experiments include observation of Leggett modes and a nodal superconducting gap in STM experiments, a large in-plane upper critical field compared to the Pauli limit, and the observation of a two-fold gap anisotropy in magnetoresistance measurements. Here, we propose a superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by spin and charge fluctuations and identify the dominant superconducting instability relevant to monolayer TaS$_2$. We then explore the effect of an additional electron-phonon pairing contribution, and compare our results with recent experimental findings. In particular, our theory stabilizes a superconducting ground state with nodal-like density of states that agrees with STM experiments. The theory obtains a large in-plane upper critical field due to a combination of Ising spin-orbit coupling and even-odd parity mixing in the superconducting state. Further, we find that an in-plane magnetic field splits the degeneracy of the superconducting ground state, and the resulting two-fold symmetric superconducting order parameter could explain the gap anisotropy observed in magnetoresistance experiments. Overall, the proposed theoretical pairing model can reconcile diverse experimental observations and remains consistent with observations on other dichalcogenide superconductors such as monolayer NbSe$_2$.</p>

This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (1) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (2) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (3) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Many-body entanglement properties of quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate both the {\em stability} and {\em spatial distribution} of entanglement for the Kitaev model of QSL, which is made {\em open} by its sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and then time-evolved in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. From the time-dependent density matrix of QSL subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and the expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: ({\em i}) in the Markovian regime, it remains nonzero only in hexagonal loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs), eventually vanishing on the same timescale on which the EV of the Wilson loop operator vanishes; ({\em ii}) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, surprisingly, GMN remains nonzero up to much higher temperatures while also remaining zero in non-loopy subregions. In addition, the non-Markovian dynamics generates emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via engineering of dissipation.</p>

            <p>Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena, but their study has involved two-dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with spin-singlet chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the interplay between superconducting and altermagnetic symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands are topologically protected, appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, and their number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed flat bands or surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to the coexistence of three distinct dependences of the charge conductance on the normal transparency, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher-dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</p>

Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS through a suitable approximation of the grandcanonical partition function which makes it factorizable. By comparing our mean-field results with numerically exact ones, we show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole grandcanonical phase diagram, becoming increasingly accurate in proximity of the transition line and exact along the line itself. Our mean-field theory suggests that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth and allows for a more accurate description of the metastable region.</p>

            <h2>Point defects and their dynamic behaviors in silver monolayer intercalated between graphene and SiC</h2>

            <p>Point defects give rise to sharp modifications in the structures and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, offering an atomic-level platform for fundamental studies and potential applications. In this work, we investigate atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated between epitaxial graphene and SiC using scanning tunneling microscopy. Dark and bright defects are identified as vacancies or substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state. Remarkably, under tunneling electron excitation at negative bias, the bright defects exhibit dynamic behaviors characterized by inelastic switching between two states. The switching can be reversibly controlled by the microscope tip, enabling the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Analysis of defect switching reveals possible defect origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. Our findings establish a pathway to precise manipulation of defects in two-dimensional metals and uncover previously unexplored dynamics with potential use in nanoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Routes to the density profile and structural inconsistency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. M. Tschopp, H. Vahid, J. M. Brader</p>
            <p>Classical density functional theory (DFT) is the primary method for investigations of inhomogeneous fluids in external fields. It requires the excess Helmholtz free energy functional as input to an Euler-Lagrange equation for the one-body density. A variant of this methodology, the force-DFT, uses instead the Yvon-Born-Green equation to generate density profiles. It is known that the latter are consistent with the virial route to the thermodynamics, while DFT is consistent with the compressibility route. In this work we will show an alternative DFT scheme using the Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) equation to obtain density profiles, that are shown to be also consistent with the compressibility route. However, force-DFT and LMBW DFT can both be implemented using a closure relation on the level of the two-body correlation functions. This is proven to be an advantageous feature, opening the possibility of an optimisation scheme in which the structural inconsistency between different routes to the density profile is minimized. (Structural inconsistency is a generalization of the notion of thermodynamic inconsistency, familiar from bulk integral equation studies.) Numerical results are given for the density profiles of two-dimensional systems of hard-core Yukawa particles with a repulsive or an attractive tail, in planar geometry.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\lambda$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $\lambda$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.</p>

            <h2>Beyond spin-1/2: Multipolar spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric crystals with time-reversal symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Bahari, Kristian Mæland, Carsten Timm, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We develop a symmetry-adapted multipolar $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory close to the bulk $\Gamma$ point for time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric $C_{3v}$ crystals in the strong atomic spin-orbit-coupling ($jj$-coupling) limit. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</p>

            <h2>Topological Charge-2ne Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Gao, Yan-Qi Wang, Hui Yang, Congjun Wu</p>
            <p>Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moiré materials. In this work we develop a general framework for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states, in both spinless and spinful systems. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low-energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rao Uzair Ahmad, Nasir Javed</p>
            <p>Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor with well-established optoelectronic properties. In this work, ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using polymer-assisted wet-chemical routes, namely hydrothermal processing and room-temperature co-precipitation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were employed as capping agents to investigate their influence on particle growth, dispersion, and optical behaviour. Room-temperature co-precipitation produced ZnS QDs with crystallite sizes as small as 2.03 nm, whereas hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature resulted in larger crystallites exceeding approximately 6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cubic zinc-blende ZnS in all samples, with peak broadening and minor lattice parameter variations associated with nanoscale dimensions. UV-visible absorption spectra exhibited systematic shifts in the absorption edge, with optical bandgap values ranging from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, consistent with size-dependent quantum confinement effects. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements verified effective polymer capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing stronger growth suppression and improved dispersion compared to PEG. These results provide insight into the role of polymer-nanocrystal interactions in wet-chemical synthesis and demonstrate how synthesis route and polymer chemistry influence the structural and optical properties of ZnS nanoparticles.</p>

            <p>We develop an efficient package for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin echo experiments to study the effects of strong electronic spin correlations on the dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble. A mean-field model is used to study correlated electronic phases through their hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. We explore the dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble and discuss the key behaviors of the system. In particular, we classify the types of temporal asymmetry that the interaction induces in the system as well as a pulse-dependent shift in the spectral domain. Using these results, we discuss how careful measurement of the pulse-dependent shift can be used to extract information about the anisotropy of the electronic interaction and how these results represent a novel tool for the examination of exotic NMR signatures in strongly correlated materials. Finally, we review specific aspects of the simulation package developed for our exploration and give explicit examples where package can be used to infer range and anisotropy of electronic correlations. In particular, we discuss its structure, accuracy, and the technical merits of the various approximations used to model the nuclear spin ensemble.</p>

            <h2>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Zaccone</p>
            <p>Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</p>

            <p>The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.</p>

            <h2>Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance and Continued Fractions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Bakr, Robin Wopalenski</p>
            <p>Accurate extraction of linearized quantum circuit models from electromagnetic simulations is essential for the design of superconducting circuits. We present a quantization framework based on the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ seen by a Josephson junction embedded in an arbitrary passive linear environment. By taking the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, we show that the linearized coupled system obeys an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition, $s Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$, whose roots determine the dressed linear mode frequencies. This boundary condition admits an exact continued fraction representation: any positive-real admittance can be realized as a canonical Cauer ladder, yielding a tridiagonal (Jacobi) structure that enables certified convergence bounds via interlacing this http URL the full nonlinear Hamiltonian, we treat Josephson junctions in the charge basis, where each cosine potential is exactly tridiagonal, and couple them to cavity modes in the Fock basis; in the general multi-junction case this yields a block-tridiagonal structure solvable by matrix continued fractions, enabling systematic diagonalization across all coupling regimes from dispersive through ultrastrong and deep strong coupling. The resulting quantization procedure is: (i)~compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii)~solve the boundary condition to obtain dressed eigenfrequencies, (iii)~synthesize an equivalent passive network, and (iv)~quantize while retaining the full cosine nonlinearity of the Josephson junction. We prove that junction participation decays as $\mathcal{O}(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies for any circuit with finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative corrections without imposed cutoffs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-Xiao Hui, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>Distinguishing an exciton condensate from an excitonic gas or insulator remains a fundamental challenge, as both phases feature bound electron-hole pairs but differ only by the emergence of macroscopic phase coherence. Here, we theoretically propose that a spin-orbit-coupled bilayer system can host a finite-momentum exciton condensate exhibiting a nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag -- the coherent-exciton diode effect. This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms.</p>

            <p>Measurement of light polarization has long been based on complex, bulk, and slow optical instruments. The advent of materials with in-situ variable polarization photoresponse has led to the concept of reconstructive polarimetry, where the detector itself plays the role of tunable polarizer. Materials enabling such functionality have been limited to complex van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate the reconstructive polarimetry with infrared (IR) detectors based on simple gated graphene-metal junctions. The reconstruction exploits the gate tuning of polarization contrast, which enables the evaluation of both infrared power and polarization angle from photovoltage measurements at two sequential gate voltages. The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width. We further show the universality of polarization reconstruction, i.e. its feasibility with different geometries of the junction, and with graphene of different quality, from hBN-encapsulated to the scalable vapor-deposited wet-transferred samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Liu, Robert Dawson, Nathaniel Gabor, Vivek Aji</p>
            <p>The coupling of atomic vibrations to electronic excitations - traditionally understood to be a source of energy loss in semiconductors - has recently been explored in photosynthetic light harvesting as a means to circumvent dissipation by harnessing quantum vibronic coherence. Motivated by recent photocurrent measurements of vibronic sidebands in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ optoelectronic devices, we present a nonperturbative theoretical framework for phonon-assisted absorption in van der Waals heterostructures. Using a polaron transformation, a closed-form expression for the optical absorption spectrum at arbitrary temperatures is presented. Our model includes both intraband and interband electron--phonon coupling. Detailed analysis shows that the observed periodic sidebands originate from the strong coupling between interlayer excitons and nearly dispersionless optical phonon modes. Comparing two limiting cases - one involving only intraband couplings, and another incorporating coherent interband processes - we show that interband phonon-assisted transitions are needed to account for the observed data. Beyond enabling the direct estimation of vibronic coupling strengths from spectroscopic data, these findings have profound consequences for our understanding of optical and optoelectronic responses: coherent interband coupling of atomic vibrations to excitons is essential to quantifying photoresponse in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report robust room temperature interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures engineered via precise stacking orientation and twist-angle control. We integrate 2H-stacked MoSe$_{2}$/$^{1}$WSe$_{2}$/$^{2}$WSe$_{2}$ heterotrilayer onto a chirped distributed Bragg reflector that acts as a backside mirror. This way, we fabricate a platform that hosts distinct heterotrilayer, heterobilayer, and homobilayer regions with enhanced excitonic features at elevated temperatures. Although the heterobilayer supports temperature-tunable singlet and triplet interlayer excitons, it exhibits low emission yield at 4 K. In comparison, the heterotrilayer shows remarkable excitonic properties, including pronounced band modulation, intervalley interlayer exciton transitions, and a tenfold photoluminescence enhancement along with a sevenfold increase in exciton decay time at cryogenic temperatures compared to the heterobilayer system. Temperature-dependent studies reveal intriguing interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterotrilayer, including the emergence of valley-polarized interlayer excitons, and the ability to maintain optical stability up to room temperature. Our results establish a clear strategy for engineering excitonic states across multilayer van der Waals heterostructures from 4 K to room temperature, providing a versatile platform for excitonic optoelectronics, quantum photonics, and tunable long-lived interlayer exciton states in scalable TMD heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction plays a crucial role in modifying the properties of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60 % higher than the initial value, then decays into a long-lived excited state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of electron correlations.

            <p>Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.</p>

            <p>Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</p>

Current first-principles calculations based on the Boltzmann transport equation often match experiments, yet they almost always neglect the effect of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity.

Thermal expansion enhances the coupling and leads to overestimation of resistivity, whereas anharmonic effects reduce it. By explicitly incorporating both effects, we establish a more complete description of resistivity in elemental metals, demonstrated here for Pb, Nb, and Al.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and tunable narrowband second-harmonic generation by a large-area etchless lithium niobate metasurface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaping Hou, Yigong Luan, Yu Fan, Alfonso Nardi, Attilio Zilli, Bobo Du, Jinyou Shao, Marco Finazzi, Chunhui Wang, Lei Zhang, Michele Celebrano</p>
            <p>Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals.</p>

            <h2>Topological Defects from Quantum Reset Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, Henrik Johannesson, Sebastian Eggert</p>
            <p>We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $\tau$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $\tau$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles A. Cardot, John Tichenor, Seth M. Shjandemaar, Josh J. Kas, Fernando D. Vila, Gerald T. Seidler, John J. Rehr</p>
            <p>Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced detection of circularly polarized photons with topological materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamideh Sharifpour, George J. de Coster, Avik W. Ghosh</p>
            <p>Topological insulators (TI) are highly attractive platforms for next-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices. Spin-momentum locking of topological surface states enhance their nonlinear optical responses and sensitivities, especially to circularly polarized light. Until now, theoretical investigations of nonlinear responses in TIs have been limited to microscopic calculations on analytical continuum models, or leveraging density functional theory based Hamiltonians. In this work, we expand beyond these two approaches by employing a nonlinear Kubo formalism to calculate second-order nonlinear optical conductivity in a slab geometry using symmetry informed tight binding models that accurately reproduce the conduction, valence and topological surface bands in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our methodology enables us to study the layer resolved contribution to injection-currents coupled to the incident electric field. We demonstrate that our technique can reveal how device engineering modifies elements of the nonlinear optical response such as the circular photogalvanic effect by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry. We find, in line with experiments, that the photogalvanic current is sensitive to field effects, Fermi level energy, gate voltage and the energy of incident light. Our computed midwavelength infrared (mid-IR) responsivity $R \approx 0.169~\mathrm{\mu A/W}$ is comparable to reported TI and intrinsic 2D-material photodetectors. We further simulate experimentally unexplored methods to modify the circular photogalvanic effect such as proximitizing a magnetic field to one of the TI surface materials, suggesting a mechanism for optoelectronic tuning.</p>

            <p>The geometry and binding energy of excitons, set by electron-hole wavefunction distributions, are fundamental factors that underpin their many-body interactions and determine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors. However, in typical solid-state systems, these quantities are fixed by material composition and structure. Here we introduce a polarizable interlayer exciton hosted in a two-dimensional tetralayer heterostructure whose dipole length, in-plane radius, and binding energy can be continuously programmed in situ over a wide range, enabling direct control over the nature of excitonic many-body phase transitions. An out-of-plane electric field redistributes layer-hybridized electron-hole wavefunctions, realizing in situ control of exciton geometry through a strong quadratic Stark response. This tunability further regulates the nature of interaction-driven Mott transition, transforming it from gradual to abrupt. Our results establish exciton geometry as a continuously tunable materials parameter, opening routes to exciton-based quantum phase-transition simulators and guiding the design of emergent optoelectronic functionalities from programmable excitonic materials.</p>

            <p>Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (>450 °C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Jofre Parra, Daniel A. Bonilla, Enrique Muñoz</p>
            <p>We study the presence of an external magnetic field, in combination with torsional strain, over the electron-phonon interactions in a type I Weyl semimetal. This particular superposition of field and strain, modeled in the continuum approximation by an effective gauge field, leads to an asymmetric pseudo-magnetic field at each Weyl node of opposite chirality. Therefore, we also studied the role of nodal asymmetry in the properties of the system by means of the Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group and the corresponding flow equations. By solving those, we discuss the evolution of the coupling parameters of the theory, and analyze possible fixed points and lattice (Peierls) instabilities emerging from interactions between phonons with the chiral Landau level in the very strong pseudo-magnetic field regime.</p>

            <h2>Exactly solvable higher-order Liouvillian exceptional points in dissipative fermionic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingtao Xu, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We propose a general class of open fermionic models where quadratic Liouvillians governing the dissipative dynamics feature exactly solvable higher-order exceptional points (EPs). Invoking the formalism of third quantization, we show that, among the multiple EPs of Liouvillian, an EP with its order approaching the system size arises as the quasisteady state of the system, leading to a gapless Liouvillian spectrum. By introducing perturbations, in the form of many-body quantum-jump processes, these higher-order EPs break down, leading to finite Liouvillian gaps with fractional power-law scalings. While the power-law scaling is a signature of the higher-order EP, its explicit form is sensitively dependent on the many-body perturbation. Finally, we discuss the steady-state approaching dynamic which can serve as detectable signals for the higher-order Liouvillian EPs.</p>

            <h2>Robust Machine Learning Framework for Reliable Discovery of High-Performance Half-Heusler Thermoelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoeb Athar, Adrien Mecibah, Philippe Jund</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <p>Engineering optical properties, such as luminescence purity and charge transfer, is crucial for harnessing the application potential of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Putting machine learning to the test in a quantum many-body system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilun Gao, Alberto Rodríguez, Rudolf A. Römer</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Entropy Production and Entropy Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longjun Xiang, Jinxiong Jia, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry, encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, has unified diverse anomalous transport phenomena in solids, yet a microscopic quantum-geometric theory of entropy transport for Bloch electrons is still lacking. We formulate an entropy continuity equation for noninteracting fermions driven by an electric field, starting from the von Neumann entropy, and obtain quantum-mechanical expressions for the entropy current density and entropy production rate. Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow.</p>

            <p>We introduce a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered imbalance in the $p$-wave superconducting pairing. By tuning the chemical potential and the pairing imbalance, we find that the eigenenergy spectrum undergoes real-to-complex transitions, and the spectral gap can change from a real to an imaginary line gap. The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant. Furthermore, we identify the existence of Majorana zero modes and finite-energy Majorana edge modes in this system. Our results reveal exotic phenomena arising from imbalanced pairing and establish a new platform for exploring topological superconductivity in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We present a fully atomistic approach to exciton-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots that bridges microscopic electronic-structure calculations with non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics. On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method. Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

            <p>This text revisits the origins of econophysics through the figure of Benoît Mandelbrot, not as the father of fractals, but as the instigator of a distinctive scientific posture. The guiding thread is methodological: accept the stubborn features of the data and use models as instruments for intuition rather than as axiomatic certificates of truth. In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates.</p>

In this work, we are motivated to investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping in a non-Hermitian and nonlinear Rice-Mele model. In particular, we uncover how non-Hermiticity parameters can induce fractional topological phases--even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the framework of the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence.

            <p>The theory of inter-spin-subband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers is proposed. Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.</p>

            <p>The construction of the Hamiltonian matrix \textbf{H} is an essential, yet computationally expensive step in \textit{ab-initio} device simulations based on density-functional theory (DFT). In homogeneous structures, the fact that a unit cell repeats itself along at least one direction can be leveraged to minimize the number of atoms considered and the calculation time. However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by modeling valence change memory (VCM) cells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.39 to 3.58 meV, as compared to DFT, when predicting the Hamiltonian matrix entries of systems made of $\sim$5,000 atoms. We then replace the DFT-computed Hamiltonian of these VCMs with the predicted one to compute their energy-resolved transmission function with a quantum transport tool. A qualitatively good agreement between both sets of curves is obtained. Our work provides a path forward to overcome the memory and computational limits of DFT, thus enabling the study of large-scale devices beyond current \textit{ab-initio} capabilities</p>

We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $\alpha$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $\beta$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.</p>

The differential magnetoresistance shows nonmonotonic behavior, a signature of electron pairing in the hydrodynamic regime. Theoretical models that account for both the influence of these interactions on shear stress relaxation and viscosity changes from electron heating show good agreement with the data. The nonlinear regime thus reveals how such correlated states govern the hydrodynamic behavior of the electron fluid. Our findings establish the nonlinear transport regime as a powerful probe for dissecting the complex interplay of correlated electron states and momentum relaxation in the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid.</p>

            <h2>The Dose Makes the Poison: Perturbative Steps Toward the Ultimate Linearized Coupled Cluster Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sylvia J. Bintrim, Ella R. Ransford, Kevin Carter-Fenk</p>
            <p>"Addition-by-subtraction" coupled cluster (CC) approaches provide a promising approach to treating the difficult strong correlation problem by simplifying the standard CC equations. In a separate vein, linearized CC methods have drawn interest for their lower computational cost, increased parallelizability, and favorable properties for extension to the excited state--but the inclusion of ring/crossed-ring terms causes singularities even for single bond breaking. A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function. Our resultant xlinCCD(2) method is regular and yields comparable results to linearized CCD in weakly-correlated regimes.</p>

            <p>Resolving where the density-wave gap opens in momentum space is essential for identifying the microscopic origin of the instability in layered nickelates. Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering, we map the momentum selectivity of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap in trilayer La4Ni3O10. We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $\alpha$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $\beta$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV. In contrast, no comparable spectral weight suppression is observed along the diagonal region of $\beta$ pockets, implying little or no gap opening. This gap topology contrasts sharply with that in La3Ni2O7, where anisotropic SDW gaps open solely on the $\beta$ pocket. Our results establish a distinct momentum-space gap topology between bilayer and trilayer nickelates, placing new constraints on the ordering wave vector and the mechanism of the density-wave instability relevant to superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-induced moiré lattices: from mosaic mobility edges to many-body localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan-Hao Yang, Zhihao Xu, Lei Ying, Qizhong Zhu</p>
            <p>We study localization driven solely by interparticle interactions in moiré lattice systems without intrinsic disorder or externally imposed quasiperiodic potentials. We consider a one-dimensional bilayer with incommensurate lattice constants, described by a spin-dependent Fermi-Hubbard-type model with short-range interlayer interactions, where quasiperiodicity emerges only through interactions. Exact diagonalization shows that quenching hopping in one layer generates an interaction-induced mosaic potential with multiple mobility edges. When both layers are dynamical, increasing interlayer interactions drives transitions among ergodic, critical, and many-body localized regimes, with energy-dependent coexistence in certain parameter ranges. An exact mapping to a noninteracting single-particle model on a higher-dimensional structured graph provides a unified interpretation of these results and suggests an experimentally accessible route to interaction-induced moiré physics and localization.</p>

            <h2>Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emil Annevelink, Varun Shankar</p>
            <p>Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijith S Parackal, Rickard Armiento, Florian Trybel</p>
            <p>Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.</p>

            <p>Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking.</p>

Using scanning SQUID, we image the local susceptibility in a hybrid Josephson junction array. On a square lattice of narrow islands, we simultaneously access both the amplitude and spatial phase structure of sensitive superconducting states. We observe periodic phase patterns at commensurate magnetic fillings. At zero field the long-range phase coherence is strongest. At a finite field, smaller than one percent of flux quantum per unit cell, the system fragments into large regions of constant superconducting phase, as a function of the applied field. Our results provide the first direct measurement of long-range phase coherence in a Josephson junction array.</p>

            <p>Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.</p>

Our analysis of both the thermal expansion and the specific heat data implies the crossover from 2D Ising-like behavior for $|(T-T_{\rm N})/T_{\rm N}|>0.3$ to 3D Ising behavior \rev{below $\simeq 1.3\times T_{\rm N}$. The 2D-like behavior is further supported by density functional calculations which show minimal dispersion perpendicular to the crystallographic $ac$ planes of the layered structure, thereby indicating the 2D nature of magnetism at higher temperatures.} Our results extend the available model materials of quasi-2D magnetism to a high-spin $S=2$ system with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe$^{2+}$-ions, thereby illustrating how magnetic order evolves in a 2D Ising-like system with orbital degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>The strange metal remains one of the great unsolved problems for 21st century science. Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($\Delta E \approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($\Delta q \approx 0.01$ Å$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations.</p>

            <h2>Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Runnels</p>
            <p>Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongyi Gao, Hio-Ieng Un, Yuxuan Huang, Henning Sirringhaus, Ian E. Jacobs</p>
            <p>Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <p>We evaluate electromagnetic-response observables in a half-filled Chern band, across a topological phase transition between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a Fermi liquid (FL) phase. While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotian Zhou, Yuli Lyanda-Geller</p>
            <p>Experiments suggest that nuclear spins play a significant role in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) near integer and fractional QHE spin transitions, but many of these phenomena still remain to be understood. Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed. Hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins provide a route for observation and control of the parafermion zero modes that can be induced when the domain wall between the polarized and unpolarized regions is placed in the proximity of a superconductor</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul C Bressloff, Samantha Linn</p>
            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha>0$ between velocity states $\pm v$ with $v>0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\in(\mathbb{R}^+,\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same.</p>

            <p>We propose a computational methodology based on a hierarchical cluster growth process to solve spin-3/2 Ising models efficiently. The method circumvents the exponential complexity (\(4^{N}\)) of the canonical ensemble partition function by iteratively constructing finite magnetic clusters of size \(N_g\), where the effective spin state of a site in generation \(g+1\) is determined by the local magnetization of a cluster from generation \(g\). This approach, which shares conceptual ground with effective field theories, allows the study of systems of effectively very large size \(N = N_0 (N_g)^{g}\). We apply the formalism to the ferromagnetic spin-3/2 Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, modeling the monolayer CrI$_3$, a prototypical two-dimensional Ising magnet. The model, calibrated using the experimental transition temperature (\(T_{c} \simeq 45\) K), successfully reproduces key experimental features: the temperature dependence of the magnetization \(m(T)\), including its inflection point, and the broadened peak in the specific heat \(c_v(T)\). We also compute the entropy \(s(T)\), finding a finite residual value at low temperatures consistent with the system's double degeneracy. Our results demonstrate that this hierarchical cluster method provides a quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient framework for studying complex magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>High-frequency stability is crucial for the performance of graphene resonators in sensing and timekeeping applications. However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators.</p>

We benchmark the formula for non-interacting and weakly-coupled electrons. To zeroth and first orders in the interaction strength, it agrees with the modern theory of orbital magnetization and its recent generalization to self-consistent Hartree-Fock bands. Our work provides an exact framework of interacting orbital magnetization beyond mean-field treatments, and paves the way for quantitative studies of strongly correlated electrons in external magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>A distinctive identifier of nodal intrinsic topological superconductivity (ITS) would the appearance of an Andreev bound state on crystal surfaces parallel to the nodal axis, in the form of a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) appearing only for $T < T_C$. Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $\Delta_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \le \Delta$, so that bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \le \Delta_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. In combination, these phenomena are consistent with a bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibiting spin triplet, time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, $B_{3u}$ symmetry in $\text{UTe}_2$.</p>

            <h2>Information Propagation and Encoding in Solids: A Quantitative Approach Towards Mechanical Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune</p>
            <p>Engineered systems typically separate mechanical function from information processing, whereas biological systems can exploit physical structure as a medium for information processing and computation. Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing.</p>

            <h2>Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.M. Maadani, F. Davoodian, E. Salahinejad</p>
            <p>Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of coherent initial ensembles on all work moments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Nayak, Sreenath K. Manikandan, Tan Van Vu, Supriya Krishnamurthy</p>
            <p>Standard treatments of quantum work using projective energy measurements erase initial coherence and alter the dynamics, thereby failing to capture the thermodynamic effects of coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates in an ensemble of initial states. In this article, we use an operational work definition that is non-intrusive, applying it to the case of a driven dissipative qubit, where the qubit's initial preparation comprises coherent superposition states, while the driving is coherence-less. We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work. This bound, counterintuitively, is also applicable to a "classical" initial ensemble with the same initial density matrix and is connected to quantum absolute irreversibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Lumia, Emanuele Tirrito, Mario Collura, Fabian H.L. Essler, Rosario Fazio</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems can be described by unraveling Lindblad master equations into ensembles of quantum trajectories. Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Jakub Zakrzewski, Piotr Sierant</p>
            <p>Fermionic non-Gaussianity quantifies a quantum state's deviation from a classically tractable free-fermionic description, constituting a necessary resource for computational quantum advantage. Here we use fermionic antiflatness (FAF) to measure this deviation across ergodic and many-body localized (MBL) regimes. We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena.</p>

Specifically, we show that the quantum Feynman measure transforms into the stochastic Wiener measure. Applying this framework to the Wigner function representation, we show that the system follows a stochastic path interpretable via classical probability theory.

            <p>Correlated microwave photon sources are key enablers for technologies in quantum-limited sensing, signal amplification and communication, but the reliance on millikelvin operating temperature limits their scalability for broader applications. Here, at room temperature, we demonstrate strong correlated microwave signals emitted from a hybrid magnon-photon platform. Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security. This work establishes cavity magnonics as a versatile and compact platform for generating correlated multi-mode microwave signals, opening new avenues for applications in classical and quantum domains.</p>

            <p>We propose a data-driven heuristic for NP-hard Ising and Max-Cut optimization that learns the update rule of an iterative dynamical system. The method learns a shared, node-wise update rule that maps local interaction fields to spin updates, parameterized by a compact multilayer perceptron with a small number of parameters. Training is performed using a zeroth-order optimizer, since backpropagation through long, recurrent Ising-machine dynamics leads to unstable and poorly informative gradients. We call this approach a neural network parameterized Ising machine (NPIM). Despite its low parameter count, the learned dynamics recover effective algorithmic structure, including momentum-like behavior and time-varying schedules, enabling efficient search in highly non-convex energy landscapes. Across standard Ising and neural combinatorial optimization benchmarks, NPIM achieves competitive solution quality and time-to-solution relative to recent learning-based methods and strong classical Ising-machine heuristics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik Zysk, Ana Vila Verde, Naveen K. Kaliannan, Kristof Karhan, Thomas D. Kühne</p>
            <p>Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Diaz-Mejia, Sergio Lerma-Hernandez, Jorge G. Hirsch</p>
            <p>Quantum chaos in isolated quantum systems is intimately linked to thermalization and the rapid relaxation of observables. Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Hoellmer, Stefano Martiniani</p>
            <p>Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> X. Z. Zhang</p>
            <p>Can superconducting order be made a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated lattices? We demonstrate that it can by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle--hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, a locally transformed $\eta$-pair lowering operator, on as little as a single lattice site, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with macroscopic $\eta$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $\eta$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. Our results establish a disorder-tolerant route to stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor via minimal local quantum-jump control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Yi Ju, Gunnar Möller, Yu-Chin Tzeng</p>
            <p>Dirac exceptional points (EPs) represent a novel class of non-Hermitian singularities that, unlike conventional EPs, reside entirely within the parity-time unbroken phase and exhibit linear energy dispersion. Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Distortions in High-Dimensional Guided Diffusion Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Ventura, Beatrice Achilli, Luca Ambrogioni, Carlo Lucibello</p>
            <p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto standard for conditional sampling in diffusion models, yet it often leads to a loss of diversity in generated samples. We formalize this phenomenon as generative distortion, defined as the mismatch between the CFG-induced sampling distribution and the true conditional distribution. Considering Gaussian mixtures and their exact scores, and leveraging tools from statistical physics, we characterize the onset of distortion in a high-dimensional regime as a function of the number of classes. Our analysis reveals that distortions emerge through a phase transition in the effective potential governing the guided dynamics. In particular, our dynamical mean-field analysis shows that distortion persists when the number of modes grows exponentially with dimension, but vanishes in the sub-exponential regime. Consistent with prior finite-dimensional results, we further demonstrate that vanilla CFG shifts the mean and shrinks the variance of the conditional distribution. We show that standard CFG schedules are fundamentally incapable of preventing variance shrinkage. Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated guidance schedule featuring a negative-guidance window, which mitigates loss of diversity while preserving class separability.</p>

            <p>Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.</p>

            <p>Disorder in photonic crystals and waveguides creates states inside the photonic band gap. These states are often described as Lifshitz tails despite exhibiting energy distributions inconsistent with Lifshitz statistics near the band edge. Here we show that in photonic-crystal waveguides with intentionally engineered anisotropic disorder, the band-edge tail accessible experimentally follows an Urbach law universally, with cumulative statistics $F(\Delta)=\exp[-(\Delta/\alpha)^\beta]$, where $\Delta$ is the spectral detuning from the band edge, and an exponent $\beta \approx 1$ independent of disorder strength and orientation. In contrast to Lifshitz behavior, the density of states is maximal at the band edge and decays into the gap. Crucially, we find that the Urbach energy $\alpha$ is anisotropic, with a pronounced directional splitting and qualitatively different scaling for disorder parallel and perpendicular to the waveguide axis. These conclusions are supported by quantitative agreement between optical measurements of GaAs photonic-crystal waveguides and full-vector simulations. The anisotropic Urbach energy emerges as a sensitive probe of disorder-mode coupling and a practical metric to characterize structural disorder in photonic devices.</p>

            <p>Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals. Se vuoi, posso anche:</p>

The results reveal that the initial strength of magnetization plays a crucial role in the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. In concrete terms, when quenching within the same phase, through the properties of observables such as Fisher zeros and magnetization, we show that the stronger the initial magnetization, the more difficult the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. The underlying mechanism is that the strong initial magnetization provides a directional effect, which inhibits the spin flipping in the process of quantum quench, making the dynamical quantum phase transition difficult to emerge. Since dynamical quantum phase transitions can be experimentally realized in various artificial systems, we hope that the physics predicted here can be experimentally verified in tabletop platforms.</p>

            <p>We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.</p>

In this work, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure of strongly coupled holographic nodal line semimetals. Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \to \infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point. This work establishes multi-partite entanglement as a powerful probe of quantum topological phase transitions in strongly coupled topological systems.</p>

            <h2>Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salma Zahran, Zhou Ao, Zhengyang Zhang, Chen Chi, Chenchen Yuan, Yanming Wang</p>
            <p>Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</p>

            <p>Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.</p>

            <h2>Semidefinite programming for understanding limitations of Lindblad equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumyadeep Sarma, Manas Kulkarni, Archak Purkayastha, Devashish Tupkary</p>
            <p>Lindbladian quantum master equations (LEs) are the most popular descriptions for quantum systems weakly coupled to baths. But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Size Scaling of the Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Quantum Spin Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuke Zhang, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>Despite the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, long-time expectation of local observables are well described by thermal ensembles, providing the foundation of quantum statistical mechanics. A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of finite-temperature quantum adiabaticity in driven many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Ying Chou, Jyong-Hao Chen</p>
            <p>Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We study shear fluctuations in non-relativistic holographic systems coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan geometry, using asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity. We identify a universal subdiffusive shear mode characterized by the quartic dispersion relation $\omega=-iD_4 k^4$, in sharp contrast to the conventional hydrodynamic diffusion. We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $\omega=-i\omega_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points. These results highlight Lifshitz holography as an efficient framework for anomalous transport in strongly coupled non-relativistic quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>The soliton nature of the super-Klein tunneling effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Olaf Lechtenfeld</p>
            <p>We establish a relationship between the Davey--Stewartson II (DS II) integrable system in $(2{+}1)$ dimensions and quasi-exactly solvable planar interacting Dirac Hamiltonians that exhibit the super-Klein tunneling (SKT) effect. The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeff Murugan, Hendrik J. R. van Zyl</p>
            <p>In this work we develop a real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of Krylov dynamics that treats Krylov complexity as an in-in observable generated by a closed time contour path integral. The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Active control over strong optical nonlinearity in solid-state systems is central to unlocking exotic many-body phenomena and scalable photonic devices. While exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform, their practical utility is often impeded by fixed interaction parameters and an intrinsic trade-off between nonlinearity and oscillator strength. Here, we report electrically tunable dipolar polaritons in a dual-gated bilayer MoS2 microcavity, demonstrating in situ reshaping of the dispersion and modulation of the light-matter coupling strength via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Crucially, this architecture enables a giant polariton-polariton interaction strength tunable by a factor of seven. This nonlinearity enhancement arises from a synergistic interplay, in which the electric field amplifies the microscopic dipolar repulsion while simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic excitonic Hopfield coefficient. Furthermore, electrostatic doping serves as an independent control knob to switch the system between strong and weak coupling regimes. Our findings bridge the gap between strong optical coupling and giant dipolar nonlinearities, establishing the TMD homobilayer as a versatile platform for engineering programmable correlated many-body states on a chip.</p>

            <p>When multifrequency Raman scattering is driven in the transient regime by two chirped pump pulses, the resulting anti-Stokes orders exhibit asymmetric spectral broadening toward lower frequencies, leading to a characteristic double-peaked structure in each order. In this Letter, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is used to investigate the spectral evolution of the first anti-Stokes Raman component. To interpret the observed features, we introduce a double-pulse interference model and employ an adaptive learning-based reconstruction algorithm using the Adam optimizer to retrieve the temporal field evolution. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental measurements. Our analysis indicates that the observed red-shifted spectral component originates from linear Raman processes within the two-photon dressed-state framework.</p>

            <p>We develop a diffuse-interface continuum model for membrane electroporation that couples a phase field for pore geometry to a quasi-static electrolyte potential and a spatially varying leaky-dielectric model for the transmembrane voltage. The main contribution is a stabilized time-integration strategy for transmembrane voltage $V_m$: the stiff leakage term is treated implicitly while the electrolyte-to-membrane ionic current is lagged, yielding a closed-form update that removes the restriction imposed by the fast dielectric relaxation time. The electrolyte potential is computed efficiently using a semi-analytical spectral Laplace solver: a 2D DCT in the membrane plane reduces the 3D problem to independent 1D ODEs in $z$, solved in closed form and reconstructed by an inverse transform. The coupled method is robust under grid refinement, reproduces the sharp-interface critical-radius bifurcation, and captures electric-field focusing through conductive pores. We also demonstrate stochastic pore nucleation by adding thermal noise to the phase-field dynamics, enabling fully emergent electroporation events without prescribing initial defects.</p>

            <p>We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</p>

To understand how multifractality may emerge in critical-like systems modeling neuronal activity, we used a neural field model exhibiting neural oscillations and a critical phase transition. We find that multifractality emerges near a synchronization phase transition, and that the pattern of variation of multifractality changes when placing the model at a different phase transition. These findings show that multifractality in temporal dynamics emerges near criticality in neural fields, providing a formal basis for interpreting multifractality in brain recordings.</p>

            <p>Living systems operate out of equilibrium, continuously consuming energy to sustain organised, functional states. Their emergent behaviour usually relies on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by external fluxes that keep some species at fixed concentrations. Hence, uncovering the principles governing the functioning of these CRNs is crucial to understand how living systems generate and regulate complexity. While kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of a CRN is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we introduce and analytically derive the "thermodynamic space" of a CRN, i.e., the range of accessible stationary concentrations that can be realized under a given energetic budget. We establish analogous bounds for reaction affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total non-equilibrium driving, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analysing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.</p>

            <p>Manipulating and controlling the band structure and the spin-splitting in the newly discovered class of magnetic materials known as 'altermagnets' is highly desirable for their application in spintronics. Based on real-time simulations for an interacting multiband tight-binding model, we propose optical excitations as an effective way to selectively control the spin-splitting of an altermagnet. The consistent treatment of electronic interactions and electron-phonon coupling in the model allows for a systematic study of the effect of these interactions on the spin-splitting of the altermagnet in the ground as well as in the excited-state. Our simulations reveal that optical excitations modify the band structure and thus lead to significant changes in the spin-splitting within 50 fs. The relative spin-splitting in the conduction band grows up to four times in the optically excited altermagnet. We disentangle the roles of Coulomb $U$ and $J$ in the enhancement of the spin-splitting in the photoexcited state. Our study elucidates the potential for exploiting optical control of spin-splitting gaps to obtain desirable properties in altermagnets on the fastest possible timescales.</p>

            <p>Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</p>

Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</p>

For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</p>

Such an anomalous symmetry arises as the discrete subgroup of the chiral U(1) symmetry of $\nu$ copies of Weyl fermions of the same chirality. Inspired by the crystalline correspondence principle, we deform the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ symmetry of (3+1)d Weyl fermion to the anomalous $C_N \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\mathrm{F}$ symmetry. Then we microscopically construct symmetry-preserving gapped boundary states of the closely-related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N \nmid \nu$, our construction admits no topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; while for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological order inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the no-go theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.</p>

            <p>Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges in designing magnonic waveguides, including limitations such as non-uniform demagnetizing fields, reduced group velocity, and restricted operating frequency ranges. We propose a magnonic waveguide design with promising properties that overcome these limitations to a significant extent. Specifically, we investigate a waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) by applying surface anisotropy in strip regions, thereby creating Bragg mirror structures to confine spin waves and guide them along a single direction. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while minimizing static demagnetizing effects. We developed a model that allows for spin-wave confinement and guidance in two perpendicular directions by spatially modulating the surface anisotropy. The theoretical model was solved using the finite element method to calculate the dispersion relations of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we determine the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.</p>

            <p>Topological matter offers opportunities for control of charge and energy flow with implications for chemistry still incompletely understood. In this work, we study an ensemble of adsorbates with an empty frontier level (LUMO) coupled to the edges, domain walls (solitons), and bulk of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polyacetylene chain across its trivial insulator, metallic, and topological insulator phases. We find that two experimentally relevant observables, charge donation into the LUMO and the magnitude of adsorbate electronic friction, are significantly impacted by the electronic phase of the SSH chain and show clear signatures of the topological phase transition. Localized, symmetry-protected midgap states at edges and solitons strongly enhance electron donation relative to both the metallic and trivial phases, whereas by contrast, the metal's extended states, despite larger total DOS near the Fermi energy, hybridize more weakly with a molecular adsorbate near a particular site. Electronic friction is largest in the metal, strongly suppressed in gapped regions, and intermediate at topological edges where hybridization splits the midgap resonance. These trends persist with disorder highlighting their robustness and suggest engineering domain walls and topological boundaries as pathways for employing topological matter in molecular catalysis and sensing.</p>

            <p>We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Chen, Qiaoyi Li, Xiaoyu Wang, Wei Li</p>
            <p>Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems under zero magnetic field. Understanding the interaction effects on topological phases within realistic model presents a significant theoretical challenge. Here, we construct a moiré superlattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich variety of interaction-driven and filling-dependent topological phases, including FCIs, Chern insulators, and generalized Wigner crystals, which are revealed in recent experiments. For FCI state, dynamical simulations uncover a single-particle excitation continuum with a finite charge gap, reflecting the fractionalized charge excitations. Finite-temperature calculations further determine characteristic charge activation and ferromagnetic transition temperatures, reconciling existing experimental discrepancies. Furthermore, using this realistic lattice model, we predict the presence of quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional fillings in tMoTe$_2$. By integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical analyses, our work establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related moiré systems.</p>

            <h2>Molecular dynamics simulation of silicon nanoparticle crystallization during laser-induced forward transfer printing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwen Liang, Wan Shou</p>
            <p>Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood, which is critical to determine the resulting microstructure and properties. In this work, we systematically investigate silicon crystallization during LIFT printing using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, MD simulation with Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential is used to investigate the size effect and surface influence on the crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found that with a decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes increasingly rare, even at low cooling rates. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 Å). The evolution of the atomic structure during solidification is also monitored to guide LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement induced by the surface layer can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on additive manufacturing of single-crystal structures and devices.</p>

            <p>Second-order topological insulating (SOTI) states in three-dimensional materials are helical one-dimensional hinge states. Inducing superconductivity in these states leads to gapless bound states, characterized by the 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relation.

Tight-binding simulations confirm the presence of multiple hinge modes, supporting our interpretation of Bi$_{0.97}$Sb$_{0.03}$ as a prototypical designable SOTI platform. Quantum confinement effect is identified by a quasi-one-dimensional bulk transport, and the confined Rashba states are responsible for the broadened hinge states.</p>

            <h2>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Chen Ye, Karma Tenzin, Jagoda Sławińska, Carmine Autieri</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the Néel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Wei, Yanmei Cai, Boyang Wen, Tianxing Ma</p>
            <p>Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamics of short-range correlations is a central challenge in strongly interacting Fermi gases. In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</p>

            <p>We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Balog, Lucija Nora Farkaš, Maroje Marohnić, Gilles Tarjus</p>
            <p>We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations of the derivative expansion, to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq 2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next (second) order of the derivative expansion to check the convergence of the results and the robustness of the conclusions. The study turns out to be much more involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely, the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are nonperturbatively related. The second order of the derivative expansion fixes several issues that were encountered at the lower level and improves the compatibility with the droplet-theory predictions. [1] A. D. Bruce and D.

            <h2>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki</p>
            <p>The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p>

            <h2>Ideal Topological Flat Bands in Two-dimensional Moiré Heterostructures with Type-II Band Alignment</h2>

            <p>Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in moiré materials. In this work, we propose a design principle for realizing topological flat bands with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moiré Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands can be realized in this model when the moiré superlattice potential is stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map this model into a topological heavy fermion model that consists of a localized orbital for "f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the flatness and quantum geometry of the flat band in the topological heavy fermion model depend on the energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will allow us to realize an ideal topological flat band with zero band-width and ideal quantum geometry. Our design strategy of topological flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material candidates for moiré heterostructures with type-II band alignment.</p>

            <p>In superconductors with multiple pairing channels, Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and clapping modes arise as fluctuations in channels whose angular momenta differ from that of the pair condensate. Crystal symmetries often impose selection rules which keep these modes optically dark. We show that if pairing occurs around a single Fermi surface, trigonal warping renders both of these modes, as well as the quasiparticle excitation gap, visible in the longitudinal and Hall optical responses. Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believed to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.</p>

            <p>The search for conditions supporting degenerate steady states in nonequilibrium topological superconductors is important for advancing dissipative quantum engineering, a field that has attracted significant research attention over the past decade. In this study, we address this problem by investigating topological superconductors hosting unpaired Majorana modes under the influence of environmental dissipative fields. Within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework and the third quantization formalism, we establish a correspondence between equilibrium Majorana zero modes and non-equilibrium kinetic zero modes. We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering. To demonstrate their applicability, we implement our general framework in the BDI-class Kitaev chain with long-range hopping and pairing terms -- a system known to host a robust edge-localized Majorana modes.</p>

            <p>Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the Adpn-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated Adpn-LiPF6 solutions (0.04M), and Li+ ions predominantly solvated by cyano groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</p>

We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates.

The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.</p>

Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</p>

Here we include stochastic lateral velocity perturbations and a roll-up mechanism to simulations performed using the Robin--Rolland model. By comparing with experimental data from Al and Ni systems, we find the stochastic perturbation energy distributions that allow us to very accurately reproduce the detector patterns seen experimentally and thus greatly improve the accuracy of the simulations.

            <p>One-dimensional (1D) quantum systems are a cornerstone of many-body physics. However, their realization in solids has traditionally relied on top-down methods, which are limited by structural disorder and coarse confinement. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally distinct route: the emergence of 1D quantum matter at the atomically sharp interface between monolayer semiconductors. Using lateral $MoSe_2-WSe_2$ heterostructures, we identify interfacial excitonic quasiparticles that are bound to the crystal junction. Photoluminescence spectroscopy resolves these excitons into a ladder of discrete states, establishing nanoscopic 1D confinement at length scales of 3 nm. These excitons possess exceptional large permanent in-plane electric dipole moments exceeding e x 2 nm, and exhibit micron-scale, highly anisotropic diffusion confined to the interface. Crucially, the lateral geometry enables dynamic, in-situ reconfiguration of the exciton's internal structure. By introducing electrostatic doping, we demonstrate a collapse of the dipole moment and a 20-fold reduction in radiative lifetime. This structural tunability establishes lateral interfaces as a uniquely powerful platform for the 'bottom-up' engineering of 1D quantum matter. By enabling the dynamic tuning of wavefunctions within a single atomic monolayer, this work opens a scalable route toward 1D excitonic circuits and strongly correlated 1D bosonic phases.</p>

            <p>Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.</p>

            <p>Manifolds with nontrivial topology play an essential role in the study of topological phases of matter. In this paper, we study the nontrivial symmetry response of the $2+1$D $Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase when the system is put on a non-orientable manifold -- the Klein bottle. In particular, we find that when a symmetry defect is inserted along the orientation-reversing cycle of the Klein bottle, the ground state of the system gets an extra charge. This response remains well defined at transition points into the trivial SPT phase, resulting in an exact two-fold degeneracy in the ground state independent of the system size. We demonstrate the symmetry response using exactly solvable lattice models of the SPT phase, as well as numerical work across the transition. We explore the connection of this result to the modular transformation of the $3+1$D $Z_2$ gauge theory and the emergent nature of the parity symmetry in the $Z_2$ SPT phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Tusher Ahmed, Chenhaoyue Wang, Amartya S. Banerjee, Nikhil Chandra Admal</p>
            <p>With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Hierarchy in Localized States of Organic Quantum Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. L. Lage, A. B. Félix, D. S. Gomes, M. L. Pereira Jr., A. Latgé</p>
            <p>Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghyun Kim, Gihyeon Jeon, Seungwoo Hwang, Jiho Lee, Jisu Jung, Seungwu Han, Sungwoo Kang</p>
            <p>While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</p>

            <p>The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of rapidly generating large data sets. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy X-ray beam (24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows spatially-resolved (~200 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records X-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the X-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mário J. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We investigate the properties of a Kolmogorov equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution defined in phase space. Energy is strictly conserved along a trajectory in phase space, meaning the equation is appropriate to describe an isolated system, and the stationary state is the Gibbs microcanonical distribution. The equation predicts the increase in entropy in agreement with thermodynamics, and in contrast with the Liouville equation, which conserves entropy. Using an approximation in which the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions, we derive the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We also consider a Kolmogorov equation to describe an open system in contact with the external environment. In this case the equation describes not only the situation in which the system is found in thermodynamic equilibrium with a Gibbs canonical distribution in the stationary state, but also the nonequilibrium steady state with a continuous production of entropy.</p>

            <p>Accurate structural relaxation is critical for advanced materials design. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which strive to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method consistently improves performance across all evaluated pretrained models; resulting in an average of roughly 32% reduction in prediction error. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications.</p>

            <p>Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Das, Soumik Mukhopadhyay</p>
            <p>Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</p>

            <p>We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and thus difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica ideas in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce \emph{replica Markov processes}, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions, and corresponding bounds for diffusion on networks. We also illustrate how replicas can handle other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Beyond on-site Hubbard interaction in charge dynamics of cuprate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Yamase</p>
            <p>In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure. This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band. We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ji Zou, Valerii K. Kozin, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja</p>
            <p>We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Tao Huang, X.S Wang</p>
            <p>Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems. Bosonic Bott index has been affirmed as a real-space topological invariant for a two-band ferromagnetic model. In this work,we theoretically investigate the topology and transport of magnons in a multi-band bosonic Kagome ferromagnetic model. We demonstrate the validity of the bosonic Bott indices of values larger than 1 in multi-band magnonic systems by showing the agreement with Chern numbers in the clean limit and the bulk-boundary correspondence during the topological phase transition. For the high Bott index phase, the disorder-induced topological phase transition occurs in a multi-step manner. Using a generalized Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we reveal how the magnon transport depends on Gilbert damping and disorder under coherent excitation or temperature difference. The results further justify the bosonic Bott index as a robust real-space topological invariant for multi-band magnonic systems and provide insights into the transport of topological magnons.</p>

            <p>Materials with interesting physical properties are often designed based on our understanding of the target physical effects. The physical properties can be either explicitly observed ("apparent") or concealed by the perceived symmetry ("hidden") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend "hidden effects" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects.</p>

            <h2>Non-invertible symmetries and mixed anomalies from conserved current construction in (3+1)D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Feng Zhang, Yizhou Huang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye</p>
            <p>We develop a current-based construction of generalized symmetries in $(3+1)$D twisted $BF$ topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), focusing on intrinsically non-invertible higher-form symmetries and their mixed anomalies. Starting from the equations of motion, we extract conserved currents and exponentiate the corresponding charges to obtain topological symmetry operators. This gives a step-by-step procedure for constructing symmetry operators, fusion, and anomaly diagnostics directly from the continuum action. We focus on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a\wedge a\wedge b$ twist, where $a$'s and $b$ are 1-form and 2-form gauge fields, respectively. These theories realize non-Abelian $(3+1)$D TQFTs supporting Borromean-rings braiding and describe three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in condensed matter. For $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, a microscopic realization is given by the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double model. Two distinct classes of conserved currents emerge: Type-I currents generate invertible higher-form symmetries with group-like fusion, while Type-II currents require additional consistency conditions on gauge-field configurations, leading to intrinsically non-invertible symmetries dressed by projectors. We compute the fusion algebra: invertible operators admit inverses, while non-invertible ones exhibit multi-channel fusion governed by projector fusion. We diagnose mixed anomalies by coupling multiple conserved currents to background gauge fields, revealing two outcomes: anomalies canceled by anomaly inflow from a higher-dimensional theory, and intrinsic gauging obstructions encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum theory. Overall, our results provide a unified and practical approach for constructing and characterizing higher-form symmetries, which can be extended to more general TQFTs and topological orders.</p>

            <p>Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</p>

We find compelling numerical evidence that the ground state is a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid, characterized by a finite topological entanglement entropy close to $\ln(4)$, the absence of both $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ and lattice symmetry breaking, and a variationally optimized ground-state energy well below competing Dirac spin liquid states. By exploiting full $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ symmetry and keeping up to 12,800 $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ multiplets, corresponding to more than one million $\mathrm{U}(1)$ states, we achieve unprecedented accuracy for two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ quantum magnets. Finite-size scaling of energies and entanglement entropies supports a robust gapped phase in the two-dimensional limit, while a gapless critical state on narrow cylinders is identified as a proximate remnant of a Dirac spin-orbital liquid. Our results establish the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ honeycomb Heisenberg model as a concrete realization of a gapped $Z_4$ spin-orbital liquid and provide robust numerical evidence for topological order in a highly symmetric two-dimensional quantum magnet.</p>

            <p>Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting qubits and microwave cavities. Niobium resonators are widely used in quantum science experiments, yet niobium's natural oxide layer contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits losses which have the power and temperature behavior expected for TLS. Moreover, the measurements agree with existing theoretical models. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels.</p>

We then highlight how AL enhances data efficiency across various data regimes, ranging from task-specific settings with limited data to the development of general-purpose datasets and large-scale models. We further provide a systematic overview of AL applications throughout the materials research pipeline, including computational simulation, composition and structural design, process optimization, and self-driving laboratory systems.

The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinava Chatterjee, Chao-Xing Liu</p>
            <p>The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.</p>

            <p>Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.</p>

            <p>Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</p>

            <p>Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</p>

            <p>Kitaev iridates have been proposed as candidates for realizing an elusive quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, in which strong spin-orbit coupling and bond-directional exchange generate a highly frustrated and entangled ground state. However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\beta$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \lesssim 10\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL.</p>

            <h2>Shearing Off the Tree: Emerging Branch Structure and Born's Rule in an Equilibrated Multiverse</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Strasberg, Joseph Schindler</p>
            <p>Within the many worlds interpretation (MWI) it is believed that, as time passes on, the linearity of the Schrödinger equation together with decoherence generate an exponentially growing tree of branches where "everything happens", provided the branches are defined for a decohering basis. By studying an example, using exact numerical diagonalization of the Schrödinger equation to compute the decoherent histories functional, we find that this picture needs revision. Our example shows decoherence for histories defined at a few times, but a significant fraction (often the vast majority) of branches shows strong interference effects for histories of many times. In a sense made precise below, the histories independently sample an equilibrated quantum process, and, remarkably, we find that only histories that sample frequencies in accordance with Born's rule remain decoherent. Our results suggest that there is more structure in the many worlds tree than previously anticipated, influencing arguments of both proponents and opponents of the MWI.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>The localization transition can be exploited as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization inducing potentials, one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the low- and high-energy eigenstates of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-André-Harper localization-delocalization transition. For the ground state, we consider the single-particle system, in addition to the system at half filling. Our work reveals that Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers superior scaling with respect to the system size compared to the pure Stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimental measurement of the QFI based on fidelity in a multibody system is a significant challenge. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provide a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Lajci, D. H. J. O'Dell, J. Mumford</p>
            <p>We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schrödinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>Time crystals are a peculiar state of matter. Their emergence hinges on ergodicity breaking, which typically originates from many-body localization or Floquet prethermalization. Here we propose a novel scheme for devising robust dissipative time crystals where the ergodicity is broken through symmetry-induced fragmentation. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we first propose a generic Liouvillian with long-time oscillations typical of time crystals. We then show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. Intriguingly, the stage-wise prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model -- as the excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group, the branching rules of the permutation group ensure the robustness of the prethermal time crystal. Our work paves the way for devising time crystals through Hilbert-space fragmentation. It also sheds light on the dynamic effects of non-Hermitian physics in many-body quantum open systems.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies the use of energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</p>

            <p>While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.</p>

            <p>The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.</p>

            <h2>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Thakur, Prabhat Prakash, Raghavan Ranganathan</p>
            <p>Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</p>

            <p>We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</p>

Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance.

            <p>Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</p>

            <p>Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</p>

            <p>The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Muolo, Hiroya Nakao, Marco Coraggio</p>
            <p>Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.</p>

            <p>Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Vittorio Erba, Emanuele Troiani, Yizhou Xu, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>Trained attention layers exhibit striking and reproducible spectral structure of the weights, including low-rank collapse, bulk deformation, and isolated spectral outliers, yet the origin of these phenomena and their implications for generalization remain poorly understood. We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks generated from the attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass theory, and approximate message passing, we obtain an exact high-dimensional characterization of training and test error, interpolation and recovery thresholds, and the spectrum of the key and query matrices. Our theory predicts the full singular-value distribution of the trained query-key map, including low-rank structure and isolated spectral outliers, in qualitative agreement with observations in more realistic transformers. Finally, for targets with power-law spectra, we show that learning proceeds through sequential spectral recovery, leading to the emergence of power-law scaling laws.</p>

            <h2>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Ryzy, Guqi Yan, Clemens Grünsteidl, Georg Watzl, Kevin Sequoia, Pavel Lapa, Haibo Huang</p>
            <p>In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry-Pérot cavity where the optical field carries orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps, allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time operation. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as a control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines.</p>

            <h2>Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kousuke Nakano, Stefano Battaglia, Jürg Hutter</p>
            <p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{ö}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva</p>
            <p>We develop a basis--covariant one--loop renormalization framework for two interacting real scalars in $D=4-\epsilon$ with the most general two--derivative Lorentz--violating quadratic form, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and direction--dependent kinetic mixing, together with general cubic and quartic interactions forming RG complete set of operators at one-loop. In dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction we compute the full set of one--loop UV divergences and obtain closed beta functions for quartic and cubic couplings, masses. The pole coefficients admit a universal spectral representation as angular averages over the direction--dependent eigenvalues and projectors of the UV kinetic matrix; all anisotropy dependence enters through a single universal kernel admitting two--particle phase--space interpretation. We classify fixed points and fixed manifolds and show, in particular, that anisotropy restricts the existence of the coupled Wilson--Fisher--type fixed point. When the cross--gradients are turned on the coefficients in beta functions are governed by six phase--space weights admitting interpretation in terms of encoding ``populations'' and ``coherences'' of the UV normal modes.</p>

            <p>Counterdiabatic driving realizes parameter displacement of an energy eigenstate of a given parametrized Hamiltonian using the adiabatic gauge potential. In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</h2>

            <p>Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</p>

            <h2>Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ievgen I. Arkhipov</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting uniquely defined Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruce Stephenson, Robin Macomber</p>
            <p>Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</p>

            <p>Cavity magnonics investigates hybrid systems where magnons interact coherently with photons, providing a platform to harness light-matter interaction in magnetic materials. Progress in this field hinges on achieving stronger and tunable nonlinear effects, which are essential for controlling magnon dynamics and frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate the magnon Kerr effect in an anisotropic magnonic system comprising a 200~nm-thick yttrium iron garnet film strongly coupled to a three-dimensional microwave resonator. The strong shape anisotropy significantly enhances the magnon Kerr effect compared to a sphere of equivalent volume, while the cavity enables sensitive probing of magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate continuous tunability of the magnitude and sign of the Kerr shift by controlling the static orientation of the magnetization. Input-output modeling of the magnon-photon interaction provides a consistent description of our system and Kerr coefficients matching the experimental results.

We report single-shot interferometric measurements of spontaneous vortex nucleation in a room-temperature organic exciton-polariton condensate. From hundreds of independent realizations we find random vortex-core positions and unbiased circulation, consistent with intrinsically stochastic, unpinned defect formation. The mean vortex number scales with pump power above threshold with an exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek freeze-out in a driven-dissipative condensate. Using reconstructed phase maps we obtain single-shot flow fields, compute the incompressible component, and extract kinetic-energy spectra. Vortex-containing realizations develop a robust Kolmogorov-like segment with Einc(k) proportional to k^(-5/3) over a finite k range, indicating the onset of turbulent spectral scaling in a quantum fluid of light. These results establish single-shot access to phase and flow as a direct route to quantifying stochastic defect formation and emerging turbulence in polariton condensates.</p>

            <p>The formation of excitonic insulator phases in quantum materials is often masked by structural distortions caused by the coupling between electronic and phononic order parameters. Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Plasmons, arising from the collective motion of electrons, can interact strongly with electromagnetic fields or photons; this capability has been exploited across a broad range of applications, from chemical reactivity to biosensing. Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering.</p>

            <h2>Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Biedermann, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>We investigate the phase diagram of moiré double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moiré unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moiré Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moiré scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. Within a renormalization group analysis of the most general symmetry-allowed low-energy field theory, we show that this semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Temporal Entanglement Transitions in the Periodically Driven Ising Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karun Gadge, Abhinav Prem, Rishabh Jha</p>
            <p>Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ (TET) in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We identify the symmetry principles underlying these transitions: they appear when the driven Hamiltonian preserves global symmetry (here, $\mathbb{Z}_2$), the initial state respects this symmetry, and the reduced density matrix carries weight in both subsystem-parity sectors, with TET occurring precisely when the sector weights become equal (given the previous two conditions are also satisfied). Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips, while remaining invisible to conventional local observables. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes TET as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.</p>

By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.</p>

Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.</p>

            <h2>Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</h2>

            <p>Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>We study the thermodynamic performance of a periodic quantum Otto cycle operating on the single-impurity Anderson model. Using a decomposition of the time-evolution generator based on the principle of minimal dissipation, combined with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we analyze the operating regimes of the quantum thermal machine and investigate effects of Coulomb interactions, strong system-reservoir coupling, and energy level alignments. Our results show that Coulomb interaction can change the operating regimes and may lead to an enhancement of the efficiency.</p>

            <p>Twisted graphene provides a tunable platform for studying superconductivity in two dimensions. In the presence of electric currents and magnetic fields, vortices determine the phenomenological properties of the material. Related studies usually address bulk properties averaging over ensembles of vortices. Here, we employ a gate-defined Josephson junction as a single-vortex sensor, enabling direct access to individual vortex dynamical events. Our measurements reveal that, at elevated temperatures (T > 100 mK), vortices enter the superconducting leads via classical thermal activation over energy barriers. At lower temperatures (T < 90 mK), we observe macroscopic quantum tunneling through these barriers. The data are consistent with a sharp, first-order type quantum-to-classical transition. From our measurements, we extract vortex entry and exit energy barriers on the order of a few Kelvin and estimate the barrier thickness to be approximately 100 nm, corresponding to about one tenth of the device width.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a conventional superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Kayatz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $\mu$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Translational and Rotational Temperature Difference in Coexisting Phases of Inertial Active Dumbbells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhasish Chaki, Hartmut Löwen</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of translational and rotational inertia on motility-induced phase separation in underdamped active dumbbells and identify the emergence of four distinct kinetic temperatures across the coexisting phases-unlike in overdamped systems. We find that the dilute, gas-like phase consistently exhibits a higher translational kinetic temperature than the dense, liquid-like phase, with this difference amplified by increasing the rotational inertia. Rotational kinetic temperatures display a similar trend, with the dense phase remaining colder than the dilute phase; however, in this case the temperature difference grows with translational inertia and activity, while becoming practically independent of rotational inertia. This counterintuitive behavior arises from the interplay of activity-driven collisions with both translational and rotational inertia in the coexisting phases. Our results highlight the critical role of translational and rotational inertia in shaping the kinetic temperature landscape of motility-induced phase separation and offer new insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of active matter.</p>

            <p>Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xin Zhong, Bitan Roy, Yun Jing</p>
            <p>The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</p>

            <h2>Radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Naimer, Paulo E. Faria Junior, Klaus Zollner, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures and the spin-orbit fields close to the high-symmetry points $K$ and $\Gamma$ of several commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers: WSe$_2$, NbSe$_2$, and WTe$_2$. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our calculations on WTe$_2$ bilayers show that their lack of $C_3$ symmetry results in spin textures that are neither radial nor tangential. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</p>

            <h2>Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naïmo Davier, Ludovic D.C. Jaubert</p>
            <p>Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface can be interpreted as an effective Fermi surface in the spectrum of the parent system, acting as a tunable energy selector despite the absence of particle filling. This effective Fermi surface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</p>

These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesús Fernández, Loïc Vanel, Antoine Bérut</p>
            <p>This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.</p>

            <p>The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity.

For an ideal gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charvát entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell--Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.</p>

            <p>We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.</p>

            <p>Collective motion is ubiquitous in active systems at all length and time scales. The mechanisms behind such collective motion usually are alignment interactions between active particles, effective alignment after collisions between agents or symmetry-breaking fluctuations induced by passive species in active suspensions. In this article, we introduce a new type of collective motion in the shape of a traveling band induced purely by confinement, where no explicit or effective alignment are prescribed among active agents. We study a suspension of run-and-tumble particles confined in microchannels comprising asymmetric boundaries: one flat wall and one array of funnel-like obstacles. We study the phase behavior of the confined active suspension upon changes in the packing fraction and the persistence length to define the stability region of the traveling band. We characterize the traveling band structurally and dynamically and study its stability with respect to the tilt angle of the obstacles. Lastly, we describe the mechanism of motion of the band, which resembles the tracked locomotion of some heavy vehicles like tractors, finding that a counter-flux of active particles in the lower part of the band, explained in terms of source-sink and vacancy diffusion mechanisms, is the facilitator of the traveling band and sustains its motion. We name this new collective phenomenon confinement-induced tracked locomotion</p>

            <p>Transport properties of single- and two-site mesoscopic quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering processes, enabling a mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model. We show that this description breaks down in circuits with four or more sites, where higher-order backscattering processes become relevant and qualitatively modify the low-energy physics, while remaining exactly marginal in three-site geometries. Focusing on the four-site circuit, we derive an effective low-energy theory that captures the resulting interaction-driven physics and reveal the emergence of unique quantum-critical points. In the vicinity of these critical points, we obtain universal conductance and scaling behavior and establish the robustness of the associated non-Fermi liquid physics. We further introduce tunneling in multichannel multi-site QH circuits and propose a promising route for realizing diverse quantum-critical phenomena. We show that a boundary sine-Gordon description can be restored in multichannel multi-site QH circuits by appropriately looping selected edge channels, a procedure that is experimentally feasible. Finally, we analyze the non-equilibrium heating effects relevant to transport measurements in QH circuits. Altogether, our results establish multi-site QH circuits as a versatile and highly controllable platform for simulating interaction-driven quantum critical phenomena.</p>

            <p>We predict that the spin-polarized electrons in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with strong electron-electron repulsion gives rise to f-wave pairing. The key point is that the first-order interaction, which is usually pair-breaking, vanishes or nearly vanishes in certain f-wave channels due to symmetry constraints. As a result, these f-wave pairing channels are governed by the subleading-order processes which enable pairing when the perturbation theory is controlled. We illustrate this using the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with on-site and nearest-neighbor repulsion, where we find a $T_c\sim 1\% $ of electron's bandwidth. For a general screened interaction, the same idea works asymptotically, but a third-order calculation is needed to fully determine the strength of f-wave pairing.</p>

            <p>Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.</p>

Both linear and quadratic vibrational interactions are taken into account.

The results obtained are consistent with measurements of ultrasonic attenuation in Al2O3:Ni, GaAs:Mn and in GaAs:Cu doped crystals. A notable feature of E$ \times $e tunneling is the existence of a range of values for quadratic vibration interaction, in which the tunneling remains coherent at sufficiently high temperatures.</p>

            <p>Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms, monocarbonyls at fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms embedded in the surface, and gem-dicarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, RhCO monocarbonyl species at adatom sites dominate. Rh(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh dimers rather than sequential adsorption of two CO molecules at an isolated, twofold Rh adatom. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Quantum quenches across continuous and first-order quantum transitions in one-dimensional quantum Ising models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics generated by quantum quenches (QQs) of the Hamiltonian parameters in many-body systems, focusing on protocols that cross first-order and continuous quantum transitions, both in finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian $H(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g > g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g<g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line).</p>

A mapping between a biased monitored qubit and a classical ``Run-and-Tumble" active particle is studied. We demonstrate that the competition between coherent Rabi driving (analogous to active motility) and measurement-induced feedback bias (analogous to persistence) mimics the behavior of biological swimmers. This framework provides a picture of measurement-induced phase transitions using the language of active matter and offering a novel pathway for designing dissipative noisy quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.</p>

By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teddy Koker, Abhijeet Gangan, Mit Kotak, Jaime Marian, Tess Smidt</p>
            <p>Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</p>

            <p>Cryogenic photon sensing for high-energy physics motivates photosensor technologies that combine large-area scalability with internal gain and stable operation at low temperature. Amorphous selenium is a promising photoconductor, yet its field- and temperature-dependent transport and avalanche response in lateral geometries have not been systematically established. This work reports field-resolved photocurrent measurements of lateral a-Se devices from 93 K to 297 K under 401 nm excitation at fields up to 120 V/um. Below avalanche onset, the external quantum efficiency was described by the Onsager model, yielding effective post-thermalization separations that decrease with decreasing temperature. The field-assisted detrapping region was evaluated using several transport models, with the data favoring field-assisted hopping and thermally-assisted tunneling as the mechanisms that best capture the temperature evolution of the photocurrent. The boundaries between field-assisted detrapping, transport-limited conduction, and avalanche shift with temperature; at 93 K the response transitions directly from detrapping into avalanche. Avalanche multiplication was analyzed using the Lucky-drift model. These results provide the first systematic characterization of cryogenic avalanche behavior in lateral a-Se detectors and establish quantitative trends relevant to low-temperature, high-gain photodetector design.</p>

            <p>Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Generative diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for sampling high-dimensional distributions, yet they typically rely on white gaussian noise and noise schedules to destroy and reconstruct information. Here, we demonstrate that driving the generative process out of equilibrium using active, temporally correlated noise sources fundamentally alters the information thermodynamics of the system. We show that coupling the data to an active non-Markovian bath creates a `memory effect' where high-level semantic information (such as class identity or molecular metastability) is stored in the temporal correlations of auxiliary degrees of freedom. Using Fisher information analysis, we prove that this active mechanism significantly retards the rate of information decay compared to passive Brownian motion. Crucially, this memory effect facilitates an earlier and more robust symmetry breaking (speciation) during the reverse generative process, allowing the system to resolve multi-scale structures, reminiscent of metastable states in molecular configurations that are washed out in the typical noising processes. Our results suggest that non-equilibrium protocols, inspired by active matter physics, offer a thermodynamically distinct and potentially advantageous pathway for recovering high-dimensional energy landscapes using generative diffusion.</p>

            <p>We introduce a geometrical framework to construct a large class of time-dependent quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in quantum drives with structured temporal profiles and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We show that our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally new classes of quantum dynamics: by utilizing a compact 2d hyperbolic Bolza surface and a nonorientable Klein-bottle surface, we demonstrate examples of a hyperbolically-driven quantum system and a nonorientably-driven quantum system respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these driven systems exhibit unusual quantized dynamical responses reflecting their different underlying topologies, under the condition of being fully gapped and in the adiabatic limit, and which have interpretations as quantized crystalline electromagnetic responses in certain exotic effective tight-binding lattice models. We envision geometric quantum driving as a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems and investigate the universal phase structures they exhibit, as well as a useful tool to enhance the capabilities of modern day quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</p>

            <p>We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET) between two separated parties $A$ and $B$, designed for transporting quantum energy across spacetime. The amount of energy gained through TQET is always greater than or equal to that obtained via natural time evolution for any spin chain where $A$ and $B$ are distinguishable. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When Bob acts immediately after receiving Alice's outcome, the protocol reduces to conventional QET. We present a proof-of-concept demonstration in the Ising model using quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3\% to around 40\%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across spacetime.</p>

            <p>Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective? We answer this question and find that quantum time crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</p>

            <p>To understand how fluctuations arise and are distributed in international trade, a question crucial for economic risk assessment and policymaking, we analyze strong adverse fluctuations-collapsed trades-defined as individual trades with sharp annual volume declines. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades (hyperedges) are clustered and their occurrence decays algebraically with trade volume (weight), which suggests inhomogeneous, epidemic-like spreading of collapse in the international trade hypergraph. Modeling collapse propagation as a contagion process and analyzing its dynamics, we show that a positive degree-weight correlation and a volume-decaying collapse rate synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse. Notably, the degree-weight correlation persisted but the volume-decay of the collapse rate weakened during the 2008-2009 global economic recession, resulting in a broader collapse spread. Our study shows how the interplay between structure and dynamics stabilizes complex systems.</p>

            <h2>The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit</h2>

            <p>In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</p>

            <p>Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</p>

In this paper, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.</p>

            <p>Understanding how microscopic few-body interactions give rise to thermal behavior in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. While individual energy eigenstates are expected to reproduce thermal equilibrium values, analytic access to highly entangled thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable Hamiltonians remains scarce. In this Letter, we construct exact infinite-temperature eigenstates of generically nonintegrable two-body Hamiltonians using stabilizer states. These states can fully reproduce thermal expectation values for all spatially local observables, extending previously known Bell-pair-based constructions to a broader class. At the same time, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy microscopic thermal equilibrium for all four-body observables. This bound is tight, as we explicitly construct a translationally invariant Hamiltonian whose stabilizer eigenstate is thermal for all two-body and three-body observables as well as all spatially local observables. Our results suggest that reproducing higher-order thermal correlations requires nonstabilizer degrees of freedom, providing analytic insight into the interplay between interaction locality, microscopic thermal equilibrium, and quantum computational complexity.</p>

            <p>A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $>$ $\Delta$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</p>

We consider a superconducting strip with a narrow pinch point at which vortices cross quasi-periodically below a spin qubit as a result of a bias current. We demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the spin qubit exhibits a pronounced peak if the vortex-crossing frequency matches the transition frequency of the spin qubit and conclude that the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of a single vortex can be obtained by dividing the corresponding voltage along the strip with the transition frequency. We discuss experimental constraints on implementing our proposed setup in spin-triplet candidate materials like UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$, and URhGe.</p>

            <p>Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum capacitance and parity switching of a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Xiao Liu</p>
            <p>An array of quantum dots coupled via superconductivity provides a new platform for creating Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes, offering a promising avenue toward topological quantum computing. In this work, we theoretically study the quantum capacitance of a minimal Kitaev chain weakly coupled to an external normal lead. We find that in the open regime, charge stability diagrams of quantum capcaitance can help to identify the sweet spot of a Kitaev chain, consistent with tunnel spectroscopy. Moreover, the quantum capacitance of a single quantum dot coupled to Andreev bound states reveals the interplay between two distinct parity switching mechanisms: coupling to an external normal lead and intrinsic quasiparticle poisoning. Our work provides useful physical insights into the quantum capacitance and parity dynamics in a quantum-dot-based Kitaev chain device.</p>

            <h2>Topological-transition-driven Giant Enhancement of Second-harmonic Generation in Ferroelectric Bismuth Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Chen, Hongjun Xiang, Yusheng Hou</p>
            <p>The interplay between band topology and light in condensed materials could unlock intriguing nonlinear optical phenomena, enabling modern photonic technologies such as quantum light sources and sub-wavelength topological lasers. Here, we unveil that a buckling-tuned topological transition in ferroelectric bismuth monolayer unleashes a giant second-harmonic generation. Using first-principles calculations, we surprisingly find that ferroelectric bismuth monolayer with a buckling parameter, $\Delta h$, has a large susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ on the order of $10^{7}$ $\mathrm{pm}^2/\mathrm{V}$, exceeding monolayer MoS$_2$ by about two orders of magnitude. When $\Delta h$ is engineered to the critical window where Dirac electrons emerge, a low-frequency resonance appears, boosting $\chi^{(2)}$ by an additional order of magnitude. We show that this enhancement is localized on the Dirac cones and dominated by intraband modification contributions. Based on an extended Dirac model, we establish that this enhancement physically originates from the ultralight effective masses $m^{*}$ of Dirac electrons through scaling with the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and band gap $E_g$. Our findings provide a general paradigm for achieving exceptional second-harmonic generation via engineering topological criticality, and could serve as an experimental signature of Dirac electrons in topological materials.</p>

            <h2>Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erekle Jmukhadze, Sam Olin, Allan H. MacDonald, Wei-Cheng Lee</p>
            <p>The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moiré materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moiré band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</p>

            <h2>Field induced superconductivity in a magnetically doped two-dimensional crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Llanos, Veronica Show, Reiley Dorrian, Joseph Falson</p>
            <p>Magnetic field induced superconductivity is a rare property in nature due to the sensitivity of spin-singlet Cooper pairing to time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations. However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general.</p>

            <h2>The superradiant phase is a finite size effect in two-photon processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Ramírez, David Villaseñor, Nahum Vázquez, Jorge G. Hirsch</p>
            <p>Two-photon light-matter interactions exhibit distinctive features such as spectral collapse. The two-photon Dicke model has been reported to exhibit a superradiant phase which could be useful in quantum applications. Here we show that this superradiant phase is not a genuine thermodynamic phase but a finite-size effect. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the superradiant region shrinks with increasing system size and disappears in the thermodynamic limit, while spectral collapse remains. Our results clarify the nature of superradiant conditions in two-photon systems and constrain its realization in quantum platforms.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Xing Ding, Wen-Tong Li, Li-Min Zhang, Yu-Biao Wu, Duanlu Zhou, Lin Zhuang, Wu-Ming Liu</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Spin Response of a Magnetic Monopole and Quantum Hall Response in Topological Lattice Models through Local Invariants and Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur, Andrea Baldanza</p>
            <p>Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Jia, Zhichao Guo, Zerong Huang, Dajun Wang</p>
            <p>We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</p>

            <h2>Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katsumasa Nakayama, Kei Suzuki</p>
            <p>The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</p>
