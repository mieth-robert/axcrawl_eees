            <h2>Continuously controllable dissipative and coherent couplings by the interaction between anti-resonance and multiple magnons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenhui Hao, Yuping Yao, Kang An, Xiling Li, Chi Zhang, Guozhi Chai</p>
            <p>Weexperimentally realize the continuously controllable dissipative coupling and coherent coupling induced by different magnon modes and the same anti-resonance. It has been observed that the weaker the microwave magnetic field distribution of the magnon mode in magnetic materials, the more likely dissipative coupling is to occur. Conversely, stronger magnetic field distributions favor coherent coupling. Based on this principle, we have designed and implemented a system that alternates between dissipative and coherent coupling regimes. It allows microwave signals to be selectively transmitted over a large applied magnetic field range at the frequency of anti-resonance. Our experimental achievements may promote the construction of new magnonics devices like magnetic-tuning switch.</p>

            <h2>Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kabir Khanna, Abhishek Kumar, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</p>
            <p>Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.</p>

            <h2>Landau levels in the mixed state of two-dimensional nodal superconductors: models, featured magneto-optical response and quantized thermal Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihai Liu, Bin Wang, Luyang Wang</p>
            <p>Landau quantization of low-energy quasiparticles (QPs) in the mixed state of gapless superconductors is a celebrated problem. So far, the only superconducting system that has been shown to host Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov QPs is the Weyl superconductor. Here, we first investigate the QPs in the mixed state of two Weyl superconductors, an intrinsic one and a heterostructure one, and reveal that the QP states in the former do not form LLs, in contrast to those in the latter where LLs of QPs are shown to exist. The key is whether the low-energy Hamiltonian respects a generalized chiral symmetry. Following the analysis, we show that a twodimensional superconducting system -- a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure respecting the generalized chiral symmetry -- exhibits LLs with Chern number $\pm 1$ in the mixed state. We also show featured responses resulting from the LLs, including peaked magneto-optical conductivity and quantized thermal Hall conductivity, which could be used as experimental probes to detect LLs in superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}>100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.</p>

            <h2>Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional in time-dependent density-functional theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared R. Williams, Carsten A. Ullrich</p>
            <p>Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al., arXiv:2401.16140.</p>

            <h2>Read out the fermion parity of a potential artificial Kitaev chain utilizing a transmon qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enna Zhuo, Xiaozhou Yang, Yuyang Huang, Zhaozheng Lyu, Ang Li, Bing Li, Yunxiao Zhang, Xiang Wang, Duolin Wang, Yukun Shi, Anqi Wang, E.P.A.M.

            <p>Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown at ambient pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyu Li, Yinqiao Hao, Ning Guo, Jian Zhang, Qiang Zheng, Guangtao Liu, Junjie Zhang</p>
            <p>Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of >18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</p>

            <h2>Room temperature observation of the anomalous in-plane Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of a Weyl ferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Sankar, Xingkai Cheng, Tahir Murtaza, Caiyun Chen, Yuqi Qin, Xuezhao Wu, Qiming Shao, Rolf Lortz, Junwei Liu, Berthold Jäck</p>
            <p>Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Polar Metal Phase in a Van der Waals Mott Magnet</h2>

Jarvis, Xiaotian Zhang, Cheng Liu, Dominik Daisenberger, Mark R. Warren, Thomas C Hansen, Stefan Klotz, Chaebin Kim, Pengtao Yang, Bosen Wang, Jinguang Cheng, Je-Geun Park, Andrew R. Wildes, Siddharth S Saxena</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of a polar metal phase in layered van der Waals compound FePSe$_3$. This Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic order offers a unique opportunity to fully tune an insulator into a polar metal state with pressure, without doping-induced disorder or impurities. Our synchrotron and neutron diffraction data unambiguously show a structural transition and loss of the inversion symmetry. We also observed the suppression of magnetic ordering and an insulator-to-metal transition correspondent with this structural transformation. The loss of the inversion symmetry combined with the pressure-induced metallicity in FePSe$_3$ offers a new platform to investigate polar metallicity at accessible pressures. Moreover, the high-pressure metallic phase shows unconventional resistivity deviating from the Fermi-liquid description, close to the magnetic critical transition pressure at sufficiently low temperatures, which strongly suggests underlying quantum criticality. Our work not only explores the comprehensive temperature-pressure phase diagram of FePSe$_3$ but also provides insights for further investigation of van der Waals strongly correlated magnetic compounds.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-dependent magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Shen, Efrain Insuasti Pazmino, Ramesh Dhakal, Friedrich Freund, Philipp Gegenwart, Stephen M. Winter, Alexander A. Tsirlin</p>
            <p>We use magnetization measurements under pressure along with \textit{ab initio} and cluster many-body calculations to investigate magnetism of the Kitaev candidate Li$_2$RhO$_3$. Hydrostatic compression leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling $K_1$ and the corresponding increase in the off-diagonal anisotropy $\Gamma_1$, whereas the experimental Curie-Weiss temperature changes from negative to positive with the slope of +40~K/GPa. On the other hand, spin freezing persists up to at least 3.46~GPa with the almost constant freezing temperature of 5~K that does not follow the large changes in the exchange couplings and indicates the likely extrinsic origin of spin freezing. Magnetic frustration in Li$_2$RhO$_3$ is mainly related to the interplay between ferromagnetic $K_1$ and antiferromagnetic $\Gamma_1$, along with the weakness of the third-neighbor coupling $J_3$ that would otherwise stabilize zigzag order. The small $J_3$ distinguishes Li$_2$RhO$_3$ from other Kitaev candidates.</p>

            <h2>How to Measure and Model Light-Induced Spin Transfer</h2>

            <p>Femtosecond laser light can transfer spin angular momentum between magnetic subspecies that exhibit hybridized valence bands within an alloy or compound, and represents the fastest route for manipulating the magnetization of a material. To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in terms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by comparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of two very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a sample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and final electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the experimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be included, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or the presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$ phase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal enhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not observed in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers were expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many more available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such signal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a metal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a transiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced spin-transfer signature.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Triplet Excitonic Insulator in the Ultra-Quantum Limit of HfTe5</h2>

            <p>More than fifty years ago, excitonic insulators, formed by the pairing of electrons and holes due to Coulomb interactions, were first predicted. Since then, excitonic insulators have been observed in various classes of materials, including quantum Hall bilayers, graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and more recently in moire superlattices. In these excitonic insulators, an electron and a hole with the same spin bind together and the resulting exciton is a spin singlet. Here, we report the experimental observation of a spin-triplet exciton insulator in the ultra-quantum limit of a three-dimensional topological material HfTe5. We observe that the spin-polarized zeroth Landau bands, dispersing along the field direction, cross each other beyond a characteristic magnetic field in HfTe5, forming the one-dimensional Weyl mode. Transport measurements reveal the emergence of a gap of about 250 {\mu}eV when the field surpasses a critical threshold. By performing the material-specific modeling, we identify this gap as a consequence of a spin-triplet exciton formation, where electrons and holes with opposite spin form bound states, and the translational symmetry is preserved. The system reaches charge neutrality following the gap opening, as evidenced by the zero Hall conductivity over a wide magnetic field range (10 - 72 T). Our finding of the spin-triplet excitonic insulator paves the way for studying novel spin transport including spin superfluidity, spin Josephson currents, and Coulomb drag of spin currents in analogy to the transport properties associated with the layer pseudospin in quantum Hall bilayers.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of electrostatic effects of a curved counter-electrode on the emitter field enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago A. de Assis, Fernando F. Dalll'Agnol</p>
            <p>Experiments on field electron emission from single-tip nanoemitters have typically been carried out using a counter-electrode with a finite curvature radius $R$, positioned at a distance $d_{\rm{gap}}$ from the emitter's apex. The effects of the counter-electrode's curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ($\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius $r_{\rm{a}} = 50$nm, is influenced by the curvature of a spherical-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between $10^2$ and $10^3$, there is a universal scaling such that $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}} = \gamma_{\rm{Pa}} \Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$, where $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and $\Psi\left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)$ is a universal scaling function such that $\Psi \sim 1$ for ${R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \gg 1$ and $\Psi \sim \left({R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \right)^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ close to unity, for $ {R}/{d_{\rm{gap}}} \ll 1$. These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orhtodox field electron emission experiments, who reported that the effective $\gamma_{\rm{Ca}}$ values extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical $\gamma_{\rm{Pa}}$ values when $R \sim d_{\rm{gap}} \gg r_{\rm{a}}$, a trend that is predicted by our results.</p>

            <h2>Giant Third-Order Nonlinearity Induced by the Quantum Metric Quadrupole in Few-Layer WTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Yu Liu, An-Qi Wang, Dong Li, Tong-Yang Zhao, Xin Liao, Zhi-Min Liao</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric properties of topological materials underpin many exotic physical phenomena and applications. Quantum nonlinearity has emerged as a powerful probe for revealing these properties. The Berry curvature dipole in nonmagnetic materials and the quantum metric dipole in antiferromagnets have been explored by studying the second-order nonlinear Hall effect. Although the quadrupole moment of the quantum geometric tensor is theoretically predicted to induce higher-order quantum nonlinearity, the quantum metric quadrupole remains experimentally unexplored. Here, we report the quantum metric quadrupole induced third-order nonlinear longitudinal electrical response in few-layer WTe2, persisting up to room temperature. Angle-resolved third-harmonic current-voltage characteristics are found consistent with the intrinsic crystal symmetry of WTe2. Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we identify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed third-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle dependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order nonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.</p>

            <p>Solid-state quantum emitters, molecular-sized complexes releasing a single photon at a time, have garnered much attention owing to their use as a key building block in various quantum technologies. Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined. Despite the current challenges, quantum emitters in hBN have steadily become a promising platform for applications in quantum information science.</p>

            <h2>Coupling of plasmons to the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter M. Gunnink, Alexander Mook</p>
            <p>The coupling of magnons and plasmons offers a promising avenue for hybrid quantum systems, facilitating coherent energy and information transfer between magnetic and charge excitations. However, existing mechanisms often depend on weak spin-orbit coupling or temperature-activated processes, limiting their robustness for low-temperature quantum technologies. Here, we propose a novel coupling mechanism between plasmons and the two-magnon continuum in antiferromagnetic insulators, which operates at zero temperature and does not require spin-orbit coupling. Using a model system consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas on an insulating antiferromagnetic substrate, we show that the electric field of the plasmons interacts with the magnetically mediated electric polarization in the antiferromagnet, arising from bonds with broken inversion symmetry. This interaction enables strong coupling to the spin-conserving two-magnon continuum, allowing for efficient hybridization.</p>

            <h2>Universal Catalyst Design Framework for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis Facilitated by Local Atomic Environment Descriptors</h2>

            <p>Developing a universal and precise design framework is crucial to search high-performance catalysts, but it remains a giant challenge due to the diverse structures and sites across various types of catalysts. To address this challenge, herein, we developed a novel framework by the refined local atomic environment descriptors (i.e., weighted Atomic Center Symmetry Function, wACSF) combined with machine learning (ML), microkinetic modeling, and computational high-throughput screening. This framework is successfully integrated into the Digital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water oxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e., metal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a ML model. The proposed wACSF descriptors integrating both geometric and chemical features are proven effective in predicting the adsorption free energies with ML. Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models accurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\Delta}GOH*) and oxygen ({\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling, a universal 2e- WOR microkinetic volcano model was derived with excellent agreement with experimental observations reported to date, which was further used to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts with the input of ML-predicted {\Delta}GOH*. Most importantly, this universal framework can significantly improve the efficiency of catalyst design by considering multiple types of materials at the same time, which can dramatically accelerate the screening of high-performance catalysts.</p>

            <p>The understanding of charge transfer processes in mixed-dimensional quasi-2D perovskites is crucial for their application in high-performance photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the link between charge transport dynamics and morphology in a thin film of quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1), grown with a distinct dimensionality gradient, where the n=1 phase is concentrated near the substrate and phases with higher dimensionality progressively increase in concentration toward the surface. By selectively exciting the n=4 phase, we observe efficient hole transfer to the n=2 and n=3 phases occurring within few tens of picoseconds after excitation. In contrast, the n=1 phase acts as a hole-blocking layer, limiting the overall charge transport efficiency. These results emphasize the critical importance of minimizing or eliminating the n=1 layer to enhance charge carrier separation and transport, offering valuable insights into the optimization of quasi-2D perovskite-based solar cells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. S. Gubina, T. Ziman, M. E. Zhitomirsky</p>
            <p>Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.</p>

            <h2>Dimensional Crossover and Emergence of Novel Phases in Puckered PdSe$_2$ under Pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanima Kundu, Soumik Das, Koushik Dey, Boby Joseph, Mainak Palit, Sanjoy Kr Mahatha, Kapildeb Dolui, Subhadeep Datta</p>
            <p>We investigate the pressure-driven structural and electronic evolution of PdSe\(_2\) using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Beyond 2.3 GPa, suppression of the Jahn-Teller distortion induces in-plane lattice expansion and metallization. Around 4.8 GPa, the interlayer \(d_{z^2}-\pi^*\) orbital hybridization drives the dimensional crossover, facilitating the transformation from the 2D distorted to a 3D undistorted pyrite phase. Above 9 GPa, a novel phase emerges, characterized by octahedral distortions in the $d$ orbitals of Pd. Structural analysis suggests the presence of marcasite (\(Pnnm\)) or arsenopyrite (\(P2_1/c\)) phase with orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations, respectively. Furthermore, the observed phonon anomaly and electronic structure modifications, including the emergence of flat bands in the high-pressure phases, elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying the previously reported exotic superconductivity with an enhanced critical temperature. These results highlight the pivotal role of dimensional crossover and structural transitions in tuning the electronic properties of puckered materials, providing pathways for novel functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Weak and strong turbulence in self-focusing and defocusing media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Rosenhaus, Gregory Falkovich</p>
            <p>While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.</p>

            <p>We deal with a type I superconductor in a constant external magnetic field. We obtain the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and apply the implicit function theorem to it. We show that there is a unique magnetic field (the critical magnetic field) given by a smooth function of the temperature and that there is also a unique nonnegative solution (the gap function) given by a smooth function of both the temperature and the external magnetic field. Using the grand potential, we show that the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a type I superconductor is of the first order. Moreover we obtain the explicit expression for the entropy gap.</p>

            <h2>A topology optimisation framework to design test specimens for one-shot identification or discovery of material models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ghouli, Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis</p>
            <p>The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a "one-shot" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.</p>

            <p>The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the Hénon-Heiles system.</p>

            <p>We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</p>

            <p>Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</p>

            <p>Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heidar Moradi, Ömer M. Aksoy, Jens H. Bardarson, Apoorv Tiwari</p>
            <p>We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so, we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries, realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion category.</p>

            <p>We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamali Mukherjee, V Satya Narayana Murthy</p>
            <p>Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age, non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co-free layer thickness in the range of 1 nm to 5 nm is taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque help to nucleate skyrmions by transforming the perpendicularly magnetized ground state. This process leads to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via a complex transformation of the Neel wall following its image inversion. Skyrmion numbers vary with increasing thickness as the current density gradually increases. The impact of higher-order anisotropy constants (up to the second order) on the relaxed state of a system, compared to first-order anisotropy alone, has been examined. Additionally, the effect of temperature on the formation of skyrmions has been analyzed for all thicknesses.</p>

            <p>The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</p>

            <p>It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.</p>

            <h2>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Ellison, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</p>

The system is equivalent to an inertial Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential whose center is controlled by a feedback protocol which measures the particle position at a specific sampling frequency $1/{\tau}$. Several feedback protocols are applied and the power generated by the engine is measured as a function of the oscillator parameters and the sampling frequency. The optimal parameters are then determined. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions and numerical simulations on overdamped systems. We highlight the specific effects of inertia, which can be used to increase the amount of power extracted by the engine. In the regime of large $\tau$, we show that the produced work has a tight bound determined by information theories.</p>

We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonja Predin</p>
            <p>The even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect has been experimentally observed in graphene in the fourth Landau level ($n = 3$). This paper is motivated by recent studies regarding the possibility of pairing and the nature of the ground state in this system. By extending the dipole representation of composite fermions, we adapt this framework to the context of graphene's quantum Hall systems, with a focus on half-filled Landau levels. We derive an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the key symmetry of half-filled Landau levels, particularly particle-hole symmetry. At the Fermi level, the energetic instability of the dipole state is influenced by the interplay between topology and symmetry, driving the system towards a critical state. We explore the possibility that this critical state stabilizes into one of the paired states with well-defined pairing solutions. However, our results demonstrate that the regularized state which satisfies boost invariance at Fermi level and lacks well-defined pairing instabilities emerges as energetically more favorable. Therefore, we find no well-defined pairing instabilities of composite fermions in the dipole representation in the half-filled fourth Landau level ($ n = 3 $) of electrons in graphene. Although the theory of composite fermions has its limitations, further research is required to investigate other possible configurations. We discuss the consistency of our results with experimental and numerical studies, and their relevance for future research efforts.</p>

            <p>We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. We argue that pinning potential and/or small deformations of the dislocations could stabilize the gapless phonon spectra. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</p>

            <p>Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heat maps show a structural transition at 50 K, which could possibly be the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Wang, Maxine Luo, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</p>

            <h2>Condensate Size Control by Net Charge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengjie Luo, Nathaniel Hess, Dilimulati Aierken, Yicheng Qiang, Jerelle A. Joseph, David Zwicker</p>
            <p>Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising diverse molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Essentially, droplets expel ions, so they cannot screen electrostatics effectively, implying droplets acquire a net charge and cannot grow indefinitely. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</p>

            <h2>Self-organization and memory in an disordered solid subject to random loading</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhittin Mungan, Dheeraj Kumar, Sylvain Patinet, Damien Vandembroucq</p>
            <p>We consider self-organization and memory formation in a mesoscopic model of an amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We develop proper read-out protocols to show that the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range, which can be subsequently retrieved. Our findings generalize previous results obtained upon oscillatory driving and suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a disordered system interacting with its fluctuating environment. The self-organization results in a correlation between the dynamics of the system and its environment. We conclude by discussing our results within the context of environmental sensing, highlighting their generalizability to adaptation strategies of simple organisms under changing conditions.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</p>

            <h2>Kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis of the cation incorporation into GeO2, SnO2, and (SnxGe1-x)O2 during suboxide molecular beam epitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenshan Chen, Kingsley Egbo, Joe Kler, Andreas Falkenstein, Jonas Lähnemann, Oliver Bierwagen</p>
            <p>Rutile GeO$_2$ is a promising ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for future power electronic devices whose alloy with the wide bandgap semiconductor rutile-SnO$_2$ enables bandgap engineering and the formation of heterostructure devices. The (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ alloy system is in its infancy and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a well-suited technique for its thin-film growth, yet presents challenges in controlling the alloy composition and growth rate. To understand and mitigate this challenge, the present study comprehensively investigates the kinetics and thermodynamics of suboxide incorporation into GeO$_2$, SnO$_2$, and (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ during suboxide MBE, the latest development in oxide MBE using suboxide sources. We find suboxide MBE to simplify the growth kinetics, offering better control over growth rates than conventional MBE but without supporting cation-driven oxide layer etching. During binary growth, SnO incorporation is kinetically favored due to its higher oxidation efficiency and lower vapor pressure compared to those of GeO. In (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ growth, however, the GeO incorporation is preferred and the SnO incorporation is suppressed, indicating a catalytic effect, where SnO promotes GeO incorporation through cation exchange. The origin of this cation exchange is likely thermodynamic yet calls for further theoretical studies. Our experimental study provides guidance for controlling the growth rate and alloy composition of (Sn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$)O$_2$ in suboxide MBE, highlighting the impact of the substrate temperature and active oxygen flux besides that of the mere SnO:GeO flux stoichiometry. The results are likely transferable to further physical and chemical vapor deposition methods, such as conventional and hybrid MBE, pulsed laser deposition, mist- or metalorganic chemical vapor deposition.</p>

            <p>Based on a microscopic model of nonequilibrium carrier generation in a leaky dielectric, we analytically derive hysteresis loops for the dielectric response of non-polar, non-ferroelectric materials. We demonstrate how complex dielectric responses can emerge solely from the influence of transport processes that depend on energy levels, voltage polarity, and asymmetries in charge transfer rates. By combining Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and voltammetry, we address critical questions related to the microscopic mechanisms in poorly conductive systems dominated by displacement currents. The impedance analysis, extended to higher-order harmonics, provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of dielectric materials, emphasizing the need to correlate impedance spectroscopy with dielectric spectroscopy for a thorough understanding of dipole relaxation and transport phenomena. Our approach provides a fully analytical framework that directly correlates microscopic charge dynamics with macroscopic dielectric responses, offering enhanced accuracy and predictive capability for systems dominated by displacement currents.</p>

            <p>The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a weakly interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.</p>

            <p>ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the fermiology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.</p>

            <p>We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism effect, the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. We demonstrate the design principles for the ferroelectric altermagnets and the additional symmetry constraints necessary for switching the altermagnetic spin splitting through flipping the electric polarization based on the state-of-the-art spin-group symmetry techniques. 22 ferroelectric altermagnets are found by screening through the 2001 experimental reported magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database and 2 of them are identified as ferroelectric switchable altermagnets. Using the hybrid improper ferroelectric material [C(NH2)3]Cr(HCOO)3 as an example, we show how the altermagnetic spin splitting is tightly coupled to the ferroelectric polarization, providing an ideal platform for designing electric-field-controllable multiferroic devices. Finally, we find that such manipulation of altermagnetism can be detected by monitoring the physical quantities that are related to the non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole, such as the linearly polarized photogalvanic spin current.</p>

            <p>The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</p>

            <p>The infinite-layer nickelates, proposed as analogs to superconducting cuprates, provide a promising platform for exploring the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. However, the superconductivity under atmospheric pressure has only been observed in thin films, indicating the heterointerface is essential. Here, we employed the advanced Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) technique to thoroughly investigate the atomic configuration, layer-resolved electronic states and phonon across the NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface. We found the Sr atoms diffusion at the interface, which results in hole doping into oxygen and nickel band to form a p-type interface. A pronounced redshift of the highest-energy optical phonon (HEOP) of NdNiO2 (~78 meV) is observed at the interface, which is primarily attributed to the epitaxial strain. Our work clarifies that the effects of the interface on electron and phonon states are mainly due to elemental intermixing and epitaxial strain, which could lay the foundation for future investigations into superconducting mechanisms of infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>(2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

            <p>Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</p>

            <p>This study reports a new meta-stable structure in epitaxial nickel-aluminum (Ni-Al) films (Al content up to 24.4 at.%) grown on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. Structure probes by XRD, HRTEM and nano-indentation combined with atomistic simulations consistently demonstrate that in thin film samples with coexisting {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases, domains of the two phases are homogeneously intermixed at the atomic-scale, forming a coherent matched lattice with one overall lattice parameter. It expands as aluminum (Al) concentration increases, with {\gamma} phase domains being progressively replaced by {\gamma}' phase domains. This behavior is similar to a solid solution, where the atomic-scale domain of the {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases act as solute and solvent, respectively. Isothermal annealing and nanoindentation reveal that the structure decomposes into distinct {\gamma}' and {\gamma} phases due to the loss of lattice matching at 400 °C, resulting in an increase in hardness. This is followed by further relaxation and domain growth at higher temperatures (600 °C and 800 °C), accompanied by a decrease in hardness. These observations confirm the metastable nature of the nanoscale {\gamma} and {\gamma}' phases system, enhance the understanding of the Ni-Al alloy system and providing new insights for meta-stable intermetallic thin film synthesis.</p>

The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Zhang, Francesco Aiello, Mauro Salazar, Diletta Giuntini</p>
            <p>To overcome the brittleness limitation of ceramics, various toughening mechanisms have been proposed. Some of the most remarkable, especially for oxides, include the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation leading to crack shielding in zirconia, and bioinspired brick-and-mortar microstructures fostering crack deflection. It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate both these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we propose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines these two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that captures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture performance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is transformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as grain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are analyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is incorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that it is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The influence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent materials is then systematically investigated. Finally, a gradient-free optimization algorithm is employed to identify optimal geometric and material parameters, revealing that longer, thinner bricks with minimal mortar thickness provide the best fracture resistance. Optimal combinations of material properties are identified for given brick sizes and mortar thicknesses.</p>

            <p>Suppressing of an ordered state that competes with superconductivity is one route to enhance superconducting transition temperatures. Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>We numerically investigate the effects of fiber aspect ratio, roughness, flexibility, and flow inertia on the rheology of concentrated suspensions. We perform direct numerical simulations modeling the fibers, suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, as continuous flexible slender bodies obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude that the contact forces and interparticle friction become one of the crucial factors governing the rheology of flexible fiber suspensions at high concentrations.</p>

            <p>Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</p>

            <p>We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the Entanglement Forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic Hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present. As an important side product, this method returns the complete energy spectrum and eigenbasis of the system.</p>

            <h2>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Li, Su-Xiang Lyu, Yao Wang, Rui-Xue Xu, Xiao Zheng, YiJing Yan</p>
            <p>Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Alishahiha, Mohammad Javad Vasli</p>
            <p>We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohreh Davoudi, Christopher Jarzynski, Niklas Mueller, Greeshma Oruganti, Connor Powers, Nicole Yunger Halpern</p>
            <p>A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinkang Guo, Oliver Hart, Chi-Fang Chen, Aaron J. Friedman, Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p>We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" in which measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical and intrinsically quantum ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of dynamical universality classes in open quantum systems, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos</p>
            <p>Since Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is non-linear, it is difficult to study superconducting properties analytically. There is a more tractable linear criterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is superconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion which gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We provide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u>T_l$ as well as systems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and show that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the same asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.</p>

            <h2>Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Yin, Federica M. Surace, Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p>We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.</p>

            <h2>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Jeyaretnam, Tanmay Bhore, Jesse J. Osborne, Jad C. Halimeh, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>Lattice gauge theories, discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories arising in the Standard Model, have become important platforms for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model, including its spectral properties, structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing double-logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within numerically accessible system sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Hawashin, Junchen Rong, Michael M. Scherer</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking can persist at all temperatures in certain biconical $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vector models when the underlying field theories are ultraviolet complete. So far, the existence of such theories has been established in fractional dimensions for local but nonunitary models or in 2+1 dimensions but for nonlocal models. Here, we study local models at zero and finite temperature directly in 2+1 dimensions employing functional methods. At zero temperature, we establish that our approach describes the quantum critical behaviour with high accuracy for all $N\geq 2$. We then exhibit the mechanism of discrete symmetry breaking from $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2\to \mathrm{O}(N)$ for increasing temperature near the biconical critical point when $N$ is finite but large. We calculate the corresponding finite-temperature phase diagram and further show that the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem is fully respected within this approach, i.e., symmetry breaking only occurs in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector. Finally, we determine the critical $N$ above which this phenomenon can be observed to be $N_c \approx 15$.</p>

            <p>The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</p>

            <p>The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin splitting bands contributed by Se/Te-pz orbitals at conduction band minimum, and their Rashba constant is closely related to the intrinsic electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs and it reopens with a nontrivial topology. In conjunction with band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides new insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.</p>

The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> András Grabarits, Federico Balducci, Adolfo del Campo</p>
            <p>We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to the determination of $p_k$ for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden quench limit.</p>

We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, of which altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate. We have elucidated the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal. We found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures obtained by ARPES commonly show a semi-quantitative agreement with the bulk-band calculation for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with that for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization for the bulk bands. These results suggest the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified a flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively, both of which are attributed to the topological surface states associated with the bulk Dirac nodal lines. The present ARPES results suggest that the crystal-orientation-dependent topological surface/interface states need to be taken into account to properly capture the transport and catalytic characteristics of RuO2.</p>

            <p>Phonons, which carry circular atomic motions, offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.</p>

            <p>Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods.

            <p>Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) have sparked considerable interest due to the presence of several intertwined symmetry-breaking phases within a single material. Recently, hysteresis and reentrant superconductivity were observed experimentally through magnetoresistance measurements in RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, providing strong evidence of a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state. The unconventional magnetic responses, combined with crystalline symmetry, impose strong constraints on the possible pairing symmetries of the superconducting state. In this work, we propose that RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an odd-parity superconductor characterized by spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The hysteresis in magnetoresistance and the reentrant superconductivity can both be explained by the formation and evolution of superconducting domains composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal properties of the kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, it is topological and characterized by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected through tunneling experiments.</p>

            <p>Muon-spin-rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments and the observation of a spontaneous Nernst effect indicate time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS) at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x\approx0.8$. Further studies have pointed out that BTRS is caused by the formation of a new state of matter associated with the condensation of pairs of electron pairs. Despite exhibiting multiple unconventional effects that warrant further investigation, the electronic spectral properties of this electron quadrupling state remain largely unexplored. Here, we present detailed $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $x = 0.77$, which has $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ > $T_{\rm c}$ according to measurements of the spontaneous Nernst effect. The NMR data obtained in this work provide the first direct electronic spectral characteristics of the electron quadrupling state by indicating that it evolves from a pseudogap that sets in at $T^*$ well above $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. This pseudogap behavior is consistent with $\mu$SR Knight-shift, specific-heat, and transport data indicating the formation of a bound state of electrons. According to a theory of electron quadrupling condensates, such bound-state formations should precede the onset of BTRS correlations between pairs of electron pairs. The second important insight from NMR data is the absence of spin-related magnetism. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1T$ and the evolution of the NMR linewidth prove the absence of a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$ and rule out even a proximity to some magnetic instability. This indicates that the spontaneous magnetic fields detected in this compound are not caused by spin magnetism but are associated with persistent real-space currents.</p>

Whereas the effect of suppressing magnetic states is still not fully understood, materials featuring charge-density waves and superconductivity offer a clearer scenario as both states can be associated with electron-phonon coupling. Metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides are prime examples for such intertwined electron-phonon-driven phases, yet, various compounds do not show the expected interrelation or feature additional mechanisms which makes an unambiguous interpretation difficult. Here, we report high-pressure X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements of the prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ and determine the evolution of the charge-density-wave state and its lattice dynamics up to and beyond its suppression at the critical pressure $p_c = 19.9(1)\,\rm{GPa}$ and at low temperatures. The high quality of our data allows the full refinement of the commensurate charge-density-wave superstructure at low pressure and we find the quantum critical point of the charge-density-wave to be in close vicinity to the reported maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 8.2\,\rm{K}$. $Ab-initio$ calculations corroborate that 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ is a reference example of order-suppressed enhanced superconductivity and can serve as a textbook case to investigate superconductivity near a charge-density-wave quantum critical point.</p>

            <h2>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail Khenner</p>
            <p>Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-metric-induced giant and reversible nonreciprocal transport phenomena in chiral loop-current phases of kagome metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Takahiro Morimoto, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, the emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry-symmetry breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5, which provides compelling evidence of time-reversal-symmetry and inversion-symmetry breakings. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we reveal that the loop-current order causes giant and reversible eMChA coefficient, $\gamma_{eM}$, is proportional to the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ times the lifetime of conduction electrons $\tau$. In kagome metals, the derived $\gamma_{eM}$ is substantial and reversible by minute magnetic fields, due to the large $\tau (\gg a_0/v_{Fermi})$ and the field-induced reversal of $M_{orb}$. By considering the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, the loop-current state becomes non-centrosymmetric, thereby giving rise to the eMChA. Surprisingly, the quantum-metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by $\sim100$ times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals, but also opens a new path for exploring quantum-metric-induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated metals</p>

            <h2>Shear banding as a cause of non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanessa K. Ward, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>Recent flow cessation experiments on soft materials have shown a counter-intuitive non-monotonic relaxation of the shear stress: following the switch-off of a steady imposed shear flow, the stress initially decays before later increasing again. By simulating the soft glassy rheology model in a form extended to allow steady state shear banding, we show that the presence of shear bands prior to flow cessation can give rise to this phenomenon. We give a mechanistic understanding of the basic physics involved, in terms of (i) the decay of the shear bands after flow cessation, and (ii) the evolution of frustrated local stresses, governed by different time scales for plastic relaxation in each band. In particular, an elastic recoil in the unsheared band gives rise to negative local frustrated stresses, the slow release of which can cause an increase in macroscopic stress. Given that shear banding and frustrated local stresses arise widely across disordered soft solids, we argue that non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation may occur in many different materials.</p>

            <h2>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Caldarelli, Alberto Guandalini, Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri</p>
            <p>We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</p>

            <h2>Rational Design Heterobilayers Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting Based on 2D Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide and Their Janus</h2>

            <p>Direct Z-scheme heterobilayers with enhanced redox potential are viewed as promising for solar-driven water splitting, arising from the synergy between intrinsic dipoles in Janus materials and interfacial electric fields across the layers. This study explores 20 two-dimensional Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers for efficient water splitting. Using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we screen them based on band gaps and intrinsic electric fields to identify promising candidates, then further assess carrier mobility and surface chemistry to fully evaluate their overall performance. By examining the alignment of synthetic and internal electric fields, we distinguish between Type-I, Type-II, and Z-scheme configurations, enabling the targeted design of optimal photocatalytic materials. Furthermore, we employ the Fröhlich interaction model to quantify the mobility contributions from the longitudinal optical phonon mode, providing detailed insights into how carrier mobility, influenced by phonon scattering, affects photocatalytic performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Janus-based Z-scheme systems to overcome existing limitations in photocatalytic water splitting by optimizing the electronic and structural properties of 2D materials, highlighting a viable pathway for advancing clean energy generation through enhanced photocatalytic processes.</p>

            <p>We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang Liu</p>
            <p>In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated Spin Systems: History of the Emergence of a Modern Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung T. Diep</p>
            <p>In 1977, Gérard Toulouse has proposed a new concept termed as "frustration" in spin systems. Using this definition, several frustrated models have been created and studied, among them we can mention the Villain's model, the fully frustrated simple cubic lattice, the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice. The former models are systems with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, while in the latter containing only an antiferromagnetic interaction, the frustration is caused by the lattice geometry. These frustrated spin systems have novel properties that we will review in this paper. One of the striking aspects is the fact that well-established methods such as the renormalization group fail to deal with the nature of the phase transition in frustrated systems. Investigations of properties of frustrated spin systems have been intensive since the 80's. I myself got involved in several investigations of frustrated spin systems soon after my PhD. I have learned a lot from numerous discussions with Gérard Toulouse. Until today, I am still working on frustrated systems such as skyrmions. In this review, I trace back a number of my works over the years on frustrated spin systems going from exactly solved 2D Ising frustrated models, to XY and Heisenberg 2D and 3D frustrated lattices. At the end I present my latest results on skyrmions resulting from the frustration caused by the competition between the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction under an applied magnetic field. A quantum spin-wave theory using the Green's function method is shown and discussed.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quadrupole gauge theory is dual to an exotic class of elastic systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. The anti-Higgs mechanism in the dual theory corresponds to a phase transition from the incompressible crystal state to an ordinary (compressible) solid.</p>

            <p>The separation of colloidal particles based solely on their surface properties is a highly challenging task. This study demonstrates that diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis enable the continuous separation of carboxylate polystyrene particles with similar sizes and zeta potentials but distinct surface concentrations of carboxyl groups. The particles are exposed to salt concentration gradients generated in a double-junction microfluidic device. Through experimental and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate how the particle dynamics are influenced by their zeta potential sensitivity to the local salt concentration, which in turn is affected by surface conductance effects induced by the surface carboxyl groups. Consequently, colloids with comparable zeta potentials but differing surface concentrations of carboxyl groups can be separated with 100% efficiency. This approach, which employs a simple, easy-to-operate device, has discipline-spanning potential for the continuous separation of colloids distinguished solely by surface properties that influence their zeta potential sensitivities, like roughness, permeability, heterogeneity, and chemical composition.</p>

            <p>Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Discontinuous Structural Transitions in Fluids with Competing Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana M. Montero, Santos B. Yuste, Andrés Santos, Mariano López de Haro</p>
            <p>This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. This study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</p>

Our electronic DFTB parameters allow computing not only the band gap but also effective masses of perovskite materials with reasonable accuracy compared to existing experimental data and state-of-the-art DFT calculations. The electronic band structures of vacancy-ordered and, lead- and iodide- deficient perovskites are also explored. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of DFTB in computing electronic band alignments in perovskite heterostructures.

            <p>The skyrmion lattice (SkL) in MnSi was studied using small-angle neutron scattering and under the influence of a radial electric current in a Corbino geometry. In response to the applied current, the SkL undergoes an angular reorientation with respect to the MnSi crystal lattice. The reorientation is non-monotonic with increasing current, with the SkL rotating first in one direction and then the other. The SkL reorientation was studied at different sample locations and found to depend on the local current density as inferred from a finite element analysis. The non-monotonic response indicates the presence of two competing effects on the SkL, most likely due to the presence of both radial electric and thermal currents. Such a scenario is supported by micromagnetic simulations, which show how these effects can act constructively or destructively to drive the SkL rotation, depending on the direction of the electric current. In addition, the simulations also suggest how the direction of the skyrmion flow may affect the SkL orientation.</p>

            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</p>

We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point.

The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tenta Tani, Soma Miki, Hiroki Mori, Minori Goto, Yoshishige Suzuki, Eiiti Tamura</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the flow of information in an interacting two-skyrmion system confined in a box at finite temperature. Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm.</p>

            <p>We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J. Calderón, A. Camjayi, A. Datta, E. Bascones</p>
            <p>Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Marini</p>
            <p>The dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex is caused by the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the electron--hole scattering with a phonon mode. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron--phonon interaction. Model Hamiltonians and {\em ab--initio} approaches have instilled the idea that this retardation is, in most of the cases, negligible. In this work I demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex cannot be neglected {\em a priori}. By using a perturbative expansion I introduce a controllable and physically sound method to evaluate and include dynamical screening effects. Based on the exact results of the homogeneous electron gas I propose a dynamical vertex correction function $\Gamma_{e-p}(\omega)$ designed to screen the commonly used adiabatic electron--phonon interaction. This function is expressed in terms of adiabatic quantities, that can be easily calculated and used to evaluate the strength of the dynamical corrections, even in realistic materials.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Estimation of Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang</p>
            <p>Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cramér-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</p>

            <h2>High order strong-coupling expansion for X-ray absorption on a dynamically screened impurity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eva Paprotzki, Martin Eckstein</p>
            <p>Time-resolved X-ray absorption can reveal the dynamical screening of the local Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated photo-excited materials. Here, we focus on the theoretical prediction of X-ray absorption in the presence of dynamical screening using the strong coupling expansion, i.e., an expansion around the isolated absorption site in terms of the retarded interaction. The evaluation of higher order diagrams is made numerically feasible by an approach based on the decomposition of the retarded interaction into complex exponentials. With this, we evaluate the strong coupling series to third order on an electron-boson model of Holstein type. We demonstrate that in relevant coupling regimes, even low orders of the strong coupling expansion can give a significant correction over the previously used lowest order approximation.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Alexander Shnirman, Rembert A. Duine</p>
            <p>One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.</p>

            <p>We report new magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K, a factor of three lower than those previously reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical to a quantum spin liquid regime. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.</p>

            <p>Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</p>

            <p>Small fluid leaks are common and frequently troublesome. We often consider how to stop a leak, but here we ask a different question: how might a leak stop itself? We experimentally study leaking flow transitions from continuous drainage to spontaneous arrest. High-speed imaging reveals that fluid breakup events generate droplets whose Laplace pressures oppose the leak. Early droplets grow unstably, allowing the leak to continue, but ultimately a final capping droplet equilibrates to a stable spherical cap via lightly damped harmonic oscillations. A total energetic theory incorporating both the potential and kinetic energy of attempted capping droplets shows that inertia plays a key role in the leak-stop mechanism. Further experiments examining the stability of rivulet flow in such a system demonstrate that a transition from continuous to discrete flow is an essential prerequisite in determining when a leak can stop itself.</p>

            <p>The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. G. Piva, C. Anteneodo</p>
            <p>We investigate a nonlocal generalization of the Fisher-KPP equation, which incorporates logistic growth and diffusion, for a single species population in a viable patch (refuge). In this framework, diffusion plays an homogenizing role, while nonlocal interactions can destabilize the spatially uniform state, leading to the emergence of spontaneous patterns. Notably, even when the uniform state is stable, spatial perturbations, such as the presence of a refuge, can still induce patterns. These phenomena are well known for environments with constant diffusivity. Our goal is to investigate how the formation of winkles in the population distribution is affected when the diffusivity is density-dependent. Then, we explore scenarios in which diffusivity is sensitive to either rarefaction or overcrowding. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of the patterns, potentially leading to either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion reacts to changes in density.</p>

In this phase, we construct a decomposition of the sphere into well-separated small clusters, each of which has exponentially small Gibbs mass, yet which together carry all but an exponentially small fraction of the Gibbs mass. We achieve this via quantitative estimates on the derivative of the Franz--Parisi potential, which measures the Gibbs mass profile around a typical sample. Corollaries on dynamics are derived, in particular we show the two-times correlation function of stationary Langevin dynamics must have an exponentially long plateau. We further show that shattering implies disorder chaos for the Gibbs measure in the optimal transport sense; this is known to imply failure of sampling algorithms which are stable under perturbation in the same metric.</p>

Not only multiple global Abelian symmetries can be easily defined and implemented, Cytnx also provides a new tool called Network that allows users to store large tensor networks and perform tensor network contractions in an optimal order automatically. With the integration of cuQuantum, tensor calculations can also be executed efficiently on GPUs. We present benchmark results for tensor operations on both devices, CPU and GPU.

            <p>As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $>4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.</p>

            <p>Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</p>

            <h2>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jielun Chen, Jiaqing Jiang, Dominik Hangleiter, Norbert Schuch</p>
            <p>We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Ferko, Cian Luke Martin</p>
            <p>We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</p>

            <p>The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</p>

            <p>We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Entangling power, gate typicality, and measurement-induced phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok, Arul Lakshminarayan</p>
            <p>When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silas R. Beane, Zeno Capatti, Roland C. Farrell</p>
            <p>A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bokang Hou, Matthew Coley-O'Rourke, Uri Banin, Michael Thoss, Eran Rabani</p>
            <p>Understanding charge transport in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies is important for developing the next generation of solar cells and light-harvesting devices based on QD technology. One of the key factors that governs the transport in such systems is related to the hybridization between the QDs. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies by directly fusing the QDs, with enhanced hybridization leading to high carrier mobilities and coherent band-like electronic transport. In this work, we theoretically investigate the electron transfer dynamics across a finite CdSe-CdS core-shell QD array, considering up to seven interconnected QDs in one dimension. We find that, even in the absence of structural and size disorder, electron transfer can become localized by the emergent low-frequency superlattice vibrational modes when the connecting neck between QDs is narrow. On the other hand, we also identify a regime where the same vibrational modes facilitate coherent electron transport when the connecting necks are wide. Overall, we elucidate the crucial effects of electronic and superlattice symmetries and their couplings when designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices.</p>

            <p>Moire lattices attract significant attention in double-layer graphene and TMD layer heterostructures as well as in photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics that emerges within these structures. However, direct measurement of the moiré ground, excited states and Bloch bands in twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report strong coupling between excitons in CsPbBr3 microplates and moire photonic modes at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states and moire polariton bands. Phase locked moire zero (in-phase) states and moire pi (antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. The moire polariton distribution can be tuned into the shape of a parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another superimposed one fixed. In addition, moire polaritons in twisted 2D honeycomb lattices are also observed. Increasing the pumping density, we realize exciton polariton condensation in the moire potential sites of the 1D/2D twisted lattices with the coherence time of around 1.4 ps. Our work lays the foundation to study coherent moire polariton condensation in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</p>

In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters.

Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhendong Yu, Haiping Huang</p>
            <p>With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laetitia P. Bettmann, John Goold</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</p>

            <p>A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <h2>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Hasebe</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The Landau models are practically useful tools to extract matrix geometries. The level projection method however cannot be applied straightforwardly to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels. We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived mechanically even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify basic properties of the deformed matrix geometries through a concrete analysis of the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models on expanding two-sphere and elongating ellipsoid. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behaviors quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. We also numerically investigate the differences between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid.</p>

            <p>We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</p>

            <p>The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

            <p>Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.</p>

            <p>In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</p>

We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.</p>

Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</p>

However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ this http URL response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile this http URL framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.</p>

            <p>Following the successful experimental realization of the long-sought Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</p>

            <p>Certain transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures based on 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ have recently displayed surprising signatures of unconventional superconductivity. While the pairing channel remains unknown, it has been argued that spin fluctuations should lead to a two-component $E'$ pairing state which is compatible with some experimental features. Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures of the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. In particular, we show how the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and threefold symmetry are reflected in the optical Hall and anisotropic conductivities, respectively, while different spectral features can be connected with the momentum dependence of the gap functions. Our work provides a fingerprint that can be measured experimentally, constraining the pairing channel in TMD superconductors, and will help determine whether superconductivity is topological in these systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haowei Xu, Ju Li</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been growing interest in achieving on-demand control of magnetism through electrical and optical means. In this work, we provide first-principles predictions for the linear and nonlinear Edelstein effects (LEE and NLEE) in the chiral topological semimetal CoSi. The LEE and NLEE represent first- and second-order magnetic responses to external electric fields, enabling precise manipulation of magnetization via electrical and optical methods. We demonstrate that although both LEE and NLEE require time-reversal symmetry breaking, they can still be realized in non-magnetic materials, as time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken by heat and dissipation, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, due to different inversion symmetry selection rules, the LEE and NLEE manifest opposite and identical signs in the two enantiomers of CoSi, respectively. We further quantify the magnitude of LEE and NLEE, showing that electrically or optically induced magnetization can reach 10 Bohr magneton per unit cell when the external electric field strength is comparable with the internal atomic electric field, which is on the order of 1 V/A. Our work offers a systematical approach for predicting the electrical and optical control of magnetism in real materials, paving the way for potential applications in areas such as spintronics and magnetic memories.</p>

            <p>As branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian matrices, the exceptional points (EPs) exhibit unique spectral topology and criticality, with intriguing dynamic consequences in non-Hermitian settings. In open quantum systems, EPs also emerge in the Liouvillian spectrum, but their dynamic impact often pertains to the transient dynamics and is challenging to demonstrate. Here, using the flexible control afforded by single-photon interferometry, we study the chiral state transfer when the Liouvillian EP is parametrically encircled. Reconstructing the density-matrix evolution by experimentally simulating the quantum Langevin equation, we show that the chirality of the dynamics is only present within an intermediate encircling timescale and dictated by the landscape of the Liouvillian spectrum near the EP. However, the chirality disappears at long times as the system always relaxes to the steady state. We then demonstrate the universal scaling of the chirality with respect to the encircling time. Our experiment confirms the transient nature of chiral state transfer near a Liouvillian EP in open quantum systems, while our scheme paves the way for simulating general open-system dynamics using single photons.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectrum in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various type of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications.

This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations.

            <p>We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.</p>

            <h2>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shane P. Kelly, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the Rényi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingya Li, Hui Jiang, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ this http URL response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile this http URL framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.</p>

Motivated by the observation of a very strongly dipolar condensate of NaCs molecules [Bigagli N et al. 2024 Nature 631 289], we demonstrate by numerical simulation, using an improved mean-field model, including the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, that in a very strongly dipolar NaCs condensate with $a_{\mathrm{dd}} = 2000a_0$, most of the above-mentioned states continue to exist and can appear for a much smaller number $N$ of particles ($N \lessapprox 1000$) within the present experimental possibility. However, in a single-component harmonically-trapped rotating NaCs condensate, a new type of coreless giant-vortex states, with a phase drop of $2 \pi L$ along a closed path around the axis of rotation, appear, where $L$ is the angular momentum of the vortex.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host bands with opposite Chern number for the two spin species and could thus be host for fractional topological insulator states. In multicomponent quantum Hall systems, where the spins have equal Chern number, the resulting topological liquid states can be well modeled by trial wavefunctions such as the Halperin $(lmn)$ wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are exact zero energy states of certain short-range (pseudopotential) Hamiltonians. However, we show that such a construction fails in the case where the Chern numbers of the two spins are opposite, since the electrons with opposite Chern number cannot avoid one another. This underlines the importance of suppressing the short-range interspin Coulomb repulsion in order to realize fractional topological insulators in twisted TMDs. We introduce a trial wavefunction for the opposite Chern number Landau levels for filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}$ in terms of pairing of composite fermions and show that it has good overlaps with the exact diagonalization ground state when the short-range Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently softened.</p>

            <p>Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.</p>

            <h2>Spectral properties from an efficient analytical representation of the $GW$ self-energy within a multipole approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dario A. Leon, Kristian Berland, Claudia Cardoso</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Padé model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Fundamental Gaps of Chromium-Based 2D Materials Using GW Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miroslav Kolos, František Karlický</p>
            <p>Precise and accurate predictions of the two-dimensional (2D) material's fundamental gap are crucial for next-generation flexible electronic and photonic devices. We, therefore, evaluated the predictivity of the GW approach in its several variants built on various density functional theory (DFT) inputs. We identified reasons for significant discrepancies between generalized gradient approximation and hybrid DFT results for intricate cases of 2D materials containing chromium and evaluated the diverse behavior of subsequent quasiparticle corrections. We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.</p>

            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics--though unavailable to them--thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Spin-flip dark excitons are optical-dipole-forbidden quasiparticles with remarkable potential in optoelectronics, especially when they are realized within cleavable van der Waals materials. Despite this potential, dark excitons have not yet been definitively identified in ferromagnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material. These excitons are shown to have spin-flip character, to disperse as a function of momentum, and to change through the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Given the versatility of van der Waals materials, these excitons hold promise for new types of magneto-optical functionality.</p>

            <p>Bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films and SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Chen, Yuqi Wang, Jingjun You, Yingqi Liu, Su Yi, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>Ultracold atoms coupled to optical cavities offer a powerful platform for studying strongly correlated many-body physics. Here, we propose an experimental scheme for creating biatomic molecules via cavity-enhanced photoassociation from an atomic condensate. This setup realizes long-range three-body interactions mediated by tripartite cavity-atom-molecule coupling. Beyond a critical pump strength, a self-organized square lattice phase for molecular condensate emerges, resulting in hybrid atom-molecule superradiance with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. Distinct from previously observed ultracold bosonic (fermionic) atomic superradiance, our findings demonstrate bosonic enhancement characterized by a cubic scaling of steady-state photon number with total atom number. Additionally, strong photon-matter entanglement is shown to effectively characterize superradiant quantum phase transition. Our findings deepen the understanding of quantum superchemistry and exotic many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in cavity-coupled quantum gases.</p>

            <p>In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Peñaranda, Héctor Ochoa, Fernando de Juan</p>
            <p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, a characteristic of heavy-fermion physics. But a global transport measurement showing clear signatures of strong correlations like local moments (LM) arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower ($V_{Th}$) as a sensitive probe for measuring entropy ($S$), we have extensively studied $V_{Th}$ of MATBLG with filling ($\nu$), temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($B$), and unveiled the presence of LM through their impact on $S$. While at high $T$, the behavior of $V_{Th}$ and resistance ($R$) are related by the Mott formula, it deviates at lower $T$. Below 120K apart from the Dirac point and full band filling, the resistance exhibits prominent peaks at integer fillings. The $V_{Th}$ however, remains featureless and symmetric across the DP with opposite signs. This disparity implies the dominance of different kinds of carriers in $V_{Th}$ and $R$. The $V_{Th}$ has additional sign changes at $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$. The locations of $\nu_{cross}$ do not change with temperature from $5-60K$. For heavy and light band electrons, it can be shown that the doping profile of the $V_{Th}$, and hence $\nu_{cross}$ is highly sensitive to $T$, and therefore solely the contribution from band electrons does not explain the $V_{Th}$ data. Our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the $S$ of the LMs. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of $B$ on the $V_{Th}$, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$ showing 30 and 50$\%$ reduction, respectively, and can be attributed to the partial polarization of the LMs (spin/valley), resulting in decreased $S$. Our $V_{Th}$ results highlight the contribution from LMs arising from flatbands, distinct from the band contributions of heavy and light fermions to the resistivity in MATBLG.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited by twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems with small twist angles, where the appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction effects. We show that, at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband, the Stoner mechanism induces a ferromagnetic polarization in the AA-stacking regions, which aligns with recent experimental observations. Our approach models the electronic properties by a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard mean-field interaction term. We employ a real-space recursion technique to self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states and use our method to investigate the magnetic properties of small-angle TBG at three-quarters filling. The recursion method's $O({\cal N})$ efficiency makes it possible to address extremely large superlattices through a full real-space approach. We validate our procedure by comparing it with mean-field momentum-space calculations from the literature, which identify a magnetic phase in charge-neutral TBGs.</p>

            <p>Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.</p>

Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Xin Wang, Wen Huang</p>
            <p>Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou</p>
            <p>By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</p>

            <p>It is well-known that water in both liquid and vapor phases exhibits exceptionally weak absorption of light in the visible range. Recent experiments, however, have demonstrated that at the liquid-air interface, absorption in the visible range is drastically increased.

Curiously, the evaporation rate peaks at green wavelengths of light, while no corresponding absorptance peak has been observed. Experiments suggest that photons can cleave off clusters of water molecules at the surface, but no clear theoretical model has yet been proposed to explain how this is possible.

Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.</p>

Using the Gaussian law for electrostatics, we derive the charge density associated with these potentials that correspond to concentric electrostatic rings. The technique is based on a modified supersymmetric transformation that allows to design time-reversal invariant interaction terms and to find the corresponding zero-energy bound states in analytical form. Consequently, solutions with the same probability density but different angular momentum are characterized by circular probability currents flowing in opposite directions. The energies of the systems defined in two Dirac valleys (one-valley) have a fourfold (twofold) degeneracy. As an example of the technique, we construct a ring-decorated Coulomb potential that exhibits zero energy collapse and bound states together.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Fermi Polarons Driven by Time-dependent Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Ran Qi</p>
            <p>We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.</p>

We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</p>

            <h2>Boundary-induced Majorana coupling in a planar topological Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongseop Kim, Sang-Jun Choi, H.-S. Sim, Sunghun Park</p>
            <p>Understanding environmental effects in a topological Josephson junction is vital for identifying signatures of Majorana modes. We consider a planar Josephson junction formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, which possesses Majorana modes inside the junction and boundary modes outside. We find that tunneling between the inner and outer modes gives rise to effective coupling between the inner Majorana modes, and hence induces energy splitting of their states even in the absence of the direct spatial overlap of their wave functions. The energy splitting is obtained analytically in the weak tunneling limit and is numerically investigated for an arbitrary tunneling strength. We discuss in detail the evolution of the energy splitting with an external perpendicular magnetic field and its effect on the shape of the Fraunhofer pattern.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Band Gap Reduction Due to Conduction Electrons in 2D TMDs: Imaginary Frequency Formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack N. Engdahl, Harley D. Scammell, Dmitry K. Efimkin, Oleg P. Sushkov</p>
            <p>Two Dimensional (2D) Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a large direct band gap which has been experimentally observed to shrink with increasing charge carrier density (doping). The effect has been the subject of theoretical study in recent years using various approaches and approximations. In this work we develop the theory of bandgap renormalization based on Feynman diagrammatic technique in the imaginary frequency formalism. We consider dynamical screening from conduction band electrons using the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as screening from a metallic gate. While our theory is general for any 2D semiconductor, to be specific we consider MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ and compare with available experimental data. In both cases we calculate large band gap renormalization that reaches several hundred meV at relatively low carrier density. This is in good agreement with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Broad Spectral Tuning of Ultra-Low Loss Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal by Intercalation</h2>

            <p>Phonon polaritons (PhPs) -- light coupled to lattice vibrations -- in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals are promising candidates for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale due to their strong field confinement, anisotropic propagation, and ultra-long lifetime in the picosecond range \cite{ref1,ref2,ref3,ref4,ref5}. However, the lack of tunability in their narrow and material-specific spectral range -- the Reststrahlen Band (RB) -- severely limits their technological implementation. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of Na atoms in the vdW semiconductor $\alpha$-V$_2$O$_5$ enables a broad spectral shift of RBs, and that the PhPs excited exhibit ultra-low losses (lifetime of $4 \pm 1$~ps), similar to PhPs in the non-intercalated crystal (lifetime of $6 \pm 1$ ps). We expect our intercalation method to be applicable to other vdW crystals, opening the door for the use of PhPs in broad spectral bands in the mid-infrared domain.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. We also present the first demonstration of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of Nb SRF cavities. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Meier, Tom Rivlin, Tiago Debarba, Jake Xuereb, Marcus Huber, Maximilian P. E. Lock</p>
            <p>The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schrödinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</p>

            <p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC) for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM. The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds, repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the 2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.</p>

To realize such promise, significant progress is still required to address materials and metrological challenges -- among which, one main challenge is to make the bulk of the topological insulator sufficiently insulating to improve the robustness of resistance quantization. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems.

            <h2>Band Structure Modeling of Perovskite Materials with Quantum ESPRESSO for Multijunction Photovoltaic Cell Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutharsika Kumar Kalaiselvi</p>
            <p>Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency, or PCE, has proven to be a critical factor in the transition to renewable energy. There exist strong interdependencies between the perovskite crystals and multijunction architectures within photovoltaic cell research. In present literature, there is a lack of intersection in investigating crystallographic geometry and compositional engineering with representation of computational modeling systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the rapid discovery of high-efficiency perovskite-based multijunction cells, specifically with silicon as the low band gap absorbing semiconductor material. We model the spatial geometries of potential perovskite candidates for high-efficiency cells using the Schrodinger Material Science Maestro, optimizing the periodic boundary conditions on the unit cell to minimize edge-bound errors. Band structure calculations using density functional theory become effective to approximate the PCE. After careful adjustments to the ibrav lattice parameter and parallelization, Quantum ESPRESSO was optimized for perovskite multijunction band structure calculations. Computational results on the six test-perovskite configurations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and method, with a calculated efficiency of about 46% for one of the modeled perovskites, placing it at the top of high-efficiency perovskite-Si multijunction cells. With this method, the potential exists to bring forth a new generation of photovoltaic cells that are easily manufacturable, highly efficient, and economical.</p>

            <p>Quantum many-body systems are challenging targets for computational physics due to their large degrees of freedom. The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems. We detail the new algorithms, input/output design, and application examples, demonstrating TeNeS-v2's applicability to various quantum spin and Bose models on two-dimensional lattices.</p>

To foster additional progress in this direction, in this work we experimentally investigate the microscopic mechanism driving polariton-polariton interactions. We measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations that are thermally generated on top of a coherent fluid of interacting lower-polaritons. By comparing the measurements with the Bogoliubov theory over both the lower and upper polariton branches simultaneously, we find that polariton-polariton interactions stem dominantly from a mechanism of saturation of the exciton oscillator strength.</p>

            <p>Hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions (JJs) are expected to harbor a novel class of Andreev bound states (ABSs), including topologically nontrivial states in four-terminal devices. In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid Al/InAs heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs, and to realize topological Andreev bands.</p>

            <p>The electronic structure of pure niobium and the niobium-titanium alloy Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ in the bcc-phase at pressures up to $250$ GPa is investigated, to reveal possible factors conducing toward the robust superconductivity reported for Ti-doped niobium upon a considerable volume reduction. We model the structural disorder using the coherent potential approximation, and the electronic correlations are taken into account using dynamical mean-field theory. At high pressure, a significant change in the topology of the Fermi surface is observed, while electronic correlations weaken with increasing pressure. Thus, the normal state of Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ is found to be a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface, and well-defined quasiparticles near it. The systematic study of the impact of disorder upon the Fermi surface at such ultra high pressures allows notable insights into the nature of the electronic states near the Fermi level, i.e., within the energy scale relevant for superconducting pairing. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate the necessity of further experimental Fermi surface explorations.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high hydrostatic pressure and, more recently, biaxial compression in epitaxial thin films has ignited significant interest in understanding the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in these compounds. Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</p>

            <p>Rich dielectric properties in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhance light-matter interactions and contribute to a variety of optical phenomena. The direct transfer of TMDs onto photonic crystals facilitates optical field confinement and modifies photon dispersion through the generation of polaritons. However, light-matter interaction is severely limited by this stacking method. This limitation can be significantly improved by constructing a vertical stacking cavity with alternating layers of dielectric material and monolayer MoS$_2$. This multilayer structure is proven to be a compact, versatile, and customizable platform for controlling Fabry-Perot cavity resonance mode. Angle-resolved reflectance further aids in studying resonance mode dispersion. Moreover, the strong light-matter interaction results in multiple perfect absorptions, with the monolayer MoS$_2$ significantly contributing to the absorption in this system, as schematically revealed by the electric field distribution. The multiple perfect absorptions produce an unusual amounts of phase singularities with topological pairs, whose generation, evolution, and annihilation can be controlled by adjusting cavity parameters. Our findings provide a flexible and consistent framework for optimizing light-matter interactions and supporting further studies on wavefront shaping, optical vortices, and topological variants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Fukaya, Kazuki Maeda, Keiji Yada, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.</p>

Hand-in-hand with density functional theory calculations, we show that this slow electron emission is governed not only by the density of states in the occupied and unoccupied band structure but is also modulated by the coupling of levels above the vacuum energy to free-vacuum states. This implies electronic doorway states which facilitate efficient propagation of electrons from the solid to vacuum, some of which only open for samples with more than 5 layers.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamics of photoexcited carriers is essential for advancing photoelectronic device design. Photon absorption generates electron-hole pairs, and subsequent scatterings can induce ultrafast thermalization within a picosecond, forming a quasi-equilibrium distribution with overheated electrons. The high-energy tail of this distribution enables carriers to overcome energy barriers, thereby enhancing quantum efficiency--a phenomenon known as photo-thermionic emission (PTE). Despite its importance, the onset and mechanisms of PTE remain under debate. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we investigate ultrafast carrier thermalization in two-dimensional materials graphene and PtTe2, and the results reveal distinct differences. In graphene, both electrons and holes thermalize into Fermi-Dirac distributions with good agreement to experiment, while PtTe2 exhibits anomalous high-energy tails for both electrons and holes, deviating significantly from Fermi-Dirac behavior. We attribute this anomaly to differences in orbital coupling between the two materials, from which we derive design principles for identifying optimal PTE candidates and, ultimately, improving photodetector performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Congliang Huang, Changkang Du, Qiangqiang Huang, Xiaodong Wang</p>
            <p>To stabilize the working temperature of an equipment, a solid-state thermal resistor is usually a requisite, which could adjust its heat conductance continuously according to the temperature. In this work, the thermal conductivity and the thermal switching performances of surface plasmon polaritons in the polymer films filled with Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) were theoretically analyzed, and a theoretical model was also derived to reveal the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature and the structure of a composite film, which is verified to be effective by numerical calculations. It shows that the thermal conductivity will decrease following ~t-3exp({\zeta}/Td) rule under the thin film limit, here t, d and T are film thickness, diameter of QDs and temperature, respectively, and {\zeta} is a constant. A high thermal conductivity could be only realized at a device with a size lager than millimeter scale, due to the need of avoiding boundary scatterings of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). At the millimeter scale, the thermal conductivity could be reduced by 100 times by increasing temperature from 300 to 400 K, which suggests a very high thermal switching ratio almost in all kinds of solid-state thermal resistor. This study brings new insights in designing thermal resistor and understanding heat conduction in films by adjusting its structures.</p>

            <h2>Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianghua Su, Xiping Fu, Yang He, Ying Shang, Kaiyuan Ji, Linghua Wen</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the key factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength, strong contrast with the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, soft-core long-range Rydberg interactions, and contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, the stability and superfluid properties of the two-component BECs with Raman-induced SOC and Rydberg interactions in free space are revealed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Finally, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</p>

            <h2>Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures</h2>

            <p>The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature ($\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$) superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system based on structural parameters integrating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements and ab initio calculations. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). The on-site Coulomb repulsive $\bm{U}$ and electron filling $\bm{n}$ dependencies of the correlated electronic structure are investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) methods. The fermi surface topology is substantially changed by $\bm{U}$ around the cRPA value, suggesting the indispensable role of correlation effects. A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach, using $\bm{U=3.5}$ and $\bm{n = 1.3}$, yields a pronounced $\bm{s^{\pm}}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $\bm{d_{z^{2}}}$ characters. Our findings may explain the similar onset $\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$ comparing pressured bulks and strained thin films of the bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Couplings between Photons and Ensemble of Emitters in a High-$Q$ Cavity at Mesoscopic Excitation Levels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenjiang Qian, Viviana Villafañe, Pedro Soubelet, Andreas V. Stier, Jonathan J. Finley</p>
            <p>We investigate the coupling between an ensemble of individual emitters and multiple photons in a high-$Q$ cavity at the mesoscopic excitation level. The master equation theory is used to calculate the emission spectrum of the cavity QED system. The increasing excitation level not only pumps the system to the high-energy multi-emitter-photon states, but also introduces the pump-induced dephasing that suppresses the coherent energy exchange (coupling) between photons and emitters. When the emitter lifetime exceeds a threshold, we observe the mesoscopic excitation level i.e., the system is pumped to high energy states whilst the coherent couplings between these states are not yet suppressed. The mesoscopic excitation enables the couplings between multi-emitter-photon states, and thereby, paves the way to building quantum photonic devices based on multiple photons and nonlinear effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwei Zhang, Alessandro Manacorda, Étienne Fodor</p>
            <p>We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to a landscape that defines three species: particles with finite size, either of type $A$ or of type $B$, and point particles $\varnothing$. We show that the nonequilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</p>

            <p>Organic diradicals are envisioned as elementary building blocks for designing a new generation of spintronic devices and have been used in constructing prototypical field effect transistors and non-linear optical devices. Open-shell systems, however, are also reactive, thus requiring design strategies to protect their radical character from the environment, especially when they are embedded into solid-state devices. Here, we report the persistence on a metallic surface of the diradical character of a diindeno[b,i]anthracene (DIAn) core protected by bulky end-groups. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on single-molecules detected singlet-triplet excitations that were absent for DIAn species packed in assembled structures. Density functional theory simulations unravel that molecular geometry on the metal substrate can crucially modify the value of the single-triplet gap via the delocalization of the radical sites. The persistence of the diradical character over metallic substrates is a promising finding for integrating radical-based materials in functional devices.</p>

The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. %taken into account. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.</p>

            <p>A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Alexander Shnirman, Rembert A. Duine</p>
            <p>One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.</p>

            <h2>Capillary Pressure-Saturation relation derived from the Pore Morphology Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Alonso-Marroquin, Martin P. Andersson</p>
            <p>A computationally efficient method to calculate the capillary pressure-saturation relations of immiscible multiphase flow on two-dimensional pore morphologies is presented here. The method is an extension of the Pore Morphology Method that includes wetting angle and trapped mechanism of the displaced fluid, and calculation of material properties by density functional theory. After validating the method with micro-chip fluid injection experiments, the method is used to relate pore morphology to capillary pressure-saturation relation using square-lattice pore morphologies. Because the method uses only morphological binary operations, it is more efficient than well-established high-resolution voxel dynamics methods such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods and Level-set computational fluid dynamics. Apart from pore morphology, only the material parameters related to contact angle (wettability) and interfacial tension are required to connect the pore-saturation relation and pore throat distribution. We investigate the effect on interfacial tension, wettability, sample size, and pore throat distribution on entry pressure and residual saturation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi</p>
            <p>Phase change materials are exploited in several enabling technologies such as storage class memories, neuromorphic devices and memories embedded in microcontrollers. A key functional property for these applications is the fast crystal nucleation and growth in the supercool liquid phase. Over the last decade, atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial insights on the early stage of this process. These simulations are, however, restricted to a few hundred atoms for at most a few ns. More recently, the scope of the DFT simulations have been greatly extended by leveraging on machine learning techniques. In this paper, we show that the exploitation of a recently devised neural network potential for the prototypical phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$, allows simulating the crystallization process in a multimillion atom model at the length and time scales of the real memory devices. The simulations provide a vivid atomistic picture of the subtle interplay between crystal nucleation and crystal growth from the crystal/amorphous rim. Moreover, the simulations have allowed quantifying the distribution of point defects controlling electronic transport, in a very large crystallite grown at the real conditions of the set process of the device.</p>

The calculated magnon dispersion reveals a parabolic profile with a minimum at the $\Gamma$ point, indicative of ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, MnRuAs exhibits intriguing electronic properties, including quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface and the formation of nodal sphere.

The collected I-V characteristics of Bi-contacted devices are compared with the performance of traditional gold contacts. The method of AFM ironing, which we used to enhance the parameters of gold contacts, is also described.

            <p>We observe the magnetic quantum oscillation in the heat capacity of the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$. The frequency of these oscillations $F = 670$ T, aligns with findings from magnetoresistance and torque magnetometry experiments for $\mu_0 H > 35$ T in the Kondo insulating phase. Remarkably, the quantum oscillation amplitudes in the heat capacity are substantial, with $\Delta \tilde{C}/T \approx$ 0.5 $\rm{mJ}$ $\rm{mol^{-1}K^{-2}}$ at 0.8 K, accounting for 13$\%$ of the known linear heat capacity coefficient $\gamma$. Double-peak structures of quantum-oscillation amplitudes due to the distribution function of fermions were identified and used to determine the value of the effective mass from the heat capacity, which agrees well with that from torque magnetometry. These observations support charge-neutral fermions contributing to the quantum oscillations in YbB$_{12}$.</p>

            <p>Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-Büttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.</p>

At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.</p>

            <p>The cytoskeleton is an active composite of filamentous proteins that dictates diverse mechanical properties and processes in eukaryotic cells by generating forces and autonomously restructuring itself. Enzymatic motors that act on the comprising filaments play key roles in this activity, driving spatiotemporally heterogeneous mechanical responses that are critical to cellular multifunctionality, but also render mechanical characterization challenging. Here, we couple optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy with simulations and mathematical modeling to robustly characterize the mechanics of active composites of actin filaments and microtubules restructured by kinesin motors. We discover that composites exhibit a rich ensemble of force response behaviors, elastic, yielding, and stiffening, with their propensity and properties tuned by motor concentration and strain rate. Moreover, intermediate kinesin concentrations elicit emergent mechanical stiffness and resistance while higher and lower concentrations exhibit softer, more viscous dissipation. We further show that composites transition from well-mixed interpenetrating double-networks of actin and microtubules to de-mixed states of microtubule-rich aggregates surrounded by relatively undisturbed actin phases. It is this de-mixing that leads to the emergent mechanical response, offering an alternate route that composites can leverage to achieve enhanced stiffness through coupling of structure and mechanics.</p>

            <p>A remarkable property of flexible self-avoiding elastic surfaces (membranes) is that they remain flat at all temperatures, even in the absence of a bending rigidity or in the presence of active fluctuations. Here, we report numerical results of these surfaces wherein we alter their topology by systematically cleaving internal bonds. While it is known that a random removal of membrane bonds does not disrupt the overall extended shape of the membrane, we find that cleaving an elastic surface with longitudinal parallel cuts leads to its systematic collapse into a number of complex morphologies that can be controlled by altering the number and length of the inserted cuts. For the simpler case of membranes with bending rigidity but in the absence of self-avoidance, we find that the radius of gyration of the surface as a function of number of cuts is represented by a universal master curve when the variables are appropriately rescaled.</p>

            <p>Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</p>

These effects are typically neglected as they do not arise in atomic quantum optics; however, they can play an important role in molecular systems.

We further demonstrate how permanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to support excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can enhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport compared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a range of environmental and system configurations.</p>

            <p>Metastructured auxetic patches, characterized by negative Poisson's ratios, offer unique mechanical properties that closely resemble the behavior of human tissues and organs. As a result, these patches have gained significant attention for their potential applications in organ repair and tissue regeneration. This study focuses on neural networks-based computational modeling of auxetic patches with a sinusoidal metastructure fabricated from silk fibroin, a bio-inspired material known for its biocompatibility and strength. The primary objective of this research is to introduce a novel, data-driven framework for patch design. To achieve this, we conducted experimental fabrication and mechanical testing to determine material properties and validate the corresponding finite element models. Finite element simulations were then employed to generate the necessary data, while greedy sampling, an active learning technique, was utilized to reduce the computational cost associated with data labeling. Two neural networks were trained to accurately predict Poisson's ratios and stresses for strains up to 15\%, respectively. Both models achieved $R^2$ scores exceeding 0.995, which indicates highly reliable predictions. Building on this, we developed a neural network-based design model capable of tailoring patch designs to achieve specific mechanical properties. This model demonstrated superior performance when compared to traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, by providing more efficient and precise design solutions. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in the design of bio-inspired metastructures for medical applications, paving the way for future innovations in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Daneshyar, Dorina Siebert, Christina Radlbeck, Stefan Kollmannsberger</p>
            <p>The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue behavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both experimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated: a dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric strain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated loading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip. Experimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of fatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2 plasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed investigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable isotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to accurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to failure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are superimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is introduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage, different stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split proving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and stiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the deviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is governed by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing differential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient terms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the plasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone test and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension specimen.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Cao, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a non-Hermitian square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</p>

            <h2>Black-box optimization and quantum annealing for filtering out mislabeled training instances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</p>

            <p>We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry.

We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.</p>

            <h2>Combined effect of incentives and coupling in multigames in two-layer networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luo-Luo Jiang, Yi-Ming Li, Wen-Jing Li, Attila Szolnoki</p>
            <p>The lack of cooperation can easily result in inequality among members of a society, which provides an increasing gap between individual incomes. To tackle this issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies and incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to reward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the equitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover, previous research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms characterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework that more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged in multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and public good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across different networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared datasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external coupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower Gini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and inequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises from the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the scale-free network. These observations help to give a deeper insight into the interplay between cooperation and wealth disparity in evolutionary games in large populations.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Point Group Symmetry of Rare-earth Dopants via Polarization-resolved Single-particle Microspectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Li, Yaxin Guo, Yaoxu Yan, Fu Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Feng Yun, Rongqian Wu, Yi Lyu, Feng Li</p>
            <p>The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as Förster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi You, Yan Sun, Feng Wang, Jun Cheng, Fujie Tang</p>
            <p>Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</p>

            <h2>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Suto</p>
            <p>A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</p>

In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to reconstruct key environmental features, going beyond the weak-coupling regime by simulating the system's dynamics using the reaction coordinate mapping. For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.</p>

            <p>Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel K. J. Boneß, Mark I. Dykman, Wolfgang Belzig</p>
            <p>A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial growth of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 thin films are investigated on c-plane sapphire, GaN- and AlNon-sapphire, and (100) oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The structural and surface morphological properties are investigated by comprehensive material characterization. Phase pure \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films are successfully grown on GaN-, AlN-on sapphire, and YSZ substrates through a systematical tuning of the growth parameters including the precursor molar flow rates, chamber pressure and growth temperature, whereas the growth on c-sapphire substrates leads to a mixture of \b{eta}- and \k{appa}polymorphs of Ga2O3 under the investigated growth conditions. The influence of the crystalline structure, surface morphology and roughness of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films grown on different substrates are investigated as a function of precursor flow rate. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films reveals abrupt interfaces between the epitaxial film and the sapphire, GaN and YSZ substrates. The growth of single crystal orthorhombic \k{appa}Ga2O3 films is confirmed by analyzing the STEM nano-diffraction pattern. The chemical composition, surface stoichiometry, and the bandgap energies of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 thin films grown on different substrates are studied by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The type-II (staggered) band alignments at three interfaces between \k{appa}-Ga2O3 and c-sapphire, AlN, and YSZ substrates are determined by XPS, with the exception of \k{appa}-Ga2O3/GaN interface, which shows type I (straddling) band alignment.</p>

            <p>The in-situ metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films is investigated as a function of crystal orientations and Al compositions of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The interface and film qualities of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics are evaluated by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging, which indicate the growth of high quality amorphous Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with abrupt interfaces on (010), (100) and (-201) oriented $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The surface stoichiometries of Al$_2$O$_3$ deposited on all orientations of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are found to be well maintained with a bandgap energy of 6.91 eV as evaluated by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is consistent with the atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics. The evolution of band offsets at both in-situ MOCVD and ex-situ ALD deposited Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are determined as a function of Al composition, indicating the influence of the deposition method, orientation, and Al composition of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films on resulting band alignments. Type II band alignments are determined at the MOCVD grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ interfaces for (010) and (100) orientations, whereas type I band alignments with relatively lower conduction band offsets are observed along (-201) orientation. Results from this work revealed that the in-situ MOCVD deposited high quality Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with sharp interfaces can be considered as a viable alternative of commonly used ex-situ deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ for developing high performance $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ based devices.</p>

Then, we focus on a limiting case, the one of slowly varying density profiles, to find approximate formulas for the surface and bulk energies of a droplet. We further characterise the system by numerically finding the excitation spectrum. It consists of two families: phononic-like excitations inside droplets and scattering modes. Analysis within the linearised regime is supplemented with the full, nonlinear dynamics of small perturbations.</p>

            <p>Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly image than the atomic structure. The charge density is dominated by the atomic nuclei, with bonding causing only a small perturbation. Thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity than imaging structure and the overall charge density. Here we achieve the sensitivity required to detect charge transfer in both pristine and defected monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} using the high dose efficiency of electron ptychography and its ability to correct for lens aberrations. Excellent agreement is achieved with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography configuration we use also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the annular dark-field signal, which can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to aid their interpretation.</p>

By systematically tuning the precursor molar flow rates, the epitaxial growth of coherently strained \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films are demonstrated with up to 25% Al compositions as evaluated by high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD). The asymmetrical reciprocal space mapping confirms the growth of coherent \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films (x < 25%) on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates. While the films show smooth surface morphologies, the alloy inhomogeneity with local segregation of Al along (-201) plane is observed from atomic resolution STEM imaging, resulting in wavy and inhomogeneous interfaces in \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 superlattice structure. Room temperature Raman spectra of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films show similar characteristics peaks as (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate without obvious Raman shifts for films with different Al compositions. Atom probe tomography (APT) was used to investigate the atomic level structural chemistry with increasing Al content in the \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films. A monotonous increase in chemical heterogeneity is observed from the in-plane Al/Ga distributions which was further confirmed via statistical frequency distribution analysis (FDA). Although the films exhibit alloy fluctuations, n-type doping with good electrical properties are demonstrated for films with various Al compositions.

            <p>The transport properties of matter have been widely investigated. In particular, shear viscosity over a wide parameter space is crucial for various applications, such as designing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets and determining the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In this work, an extended random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model (ext-RWSP-VM) based on the statistics of random-walk ions and the Debye shielding effect is proposed to elevate the temperature limit of RWSP-VM [Phys. Rev. E 106, 014142] in evaluating the shear viscosity of one component plasma. In the extended model, we reconsider the collision distance that is introduced by hard-sphere concept, hence, it is applicable in wide temperature regime rather than a narrower one in which RWSP-VM is applicable. The results of H, C, Al, Fe, Ge, W, and U show that the extended model provides a systematic way to calculate the shear viscosity of arbitrary one component plasma at the densities from about 0.1 to 10 times the normal density (the density at room temperature and 1 standard atmosphere). This work will help to develop viscosity model in wide regime when combined with our previous low temperature viscosity model [AIP Adv. 11, 015043].</p>

In this paper, we propose a setup to realize the unidirectional superconductivity as a nonequilibrium steady state. We focus on the in-plane transport of atomically thin bilayer superconductors lacking the in-plane inversion symmetry and introduce dissipation by applying the out-of-plane electric field and current. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that locally stable steady-state solutions appear only under the in-plane supercurrent when the out-of-plane electric field exceeds a threshold value. Our system also realizes the dissipation-induced superconducting diode effect up to 100% efficiency by purely electric means.</p>

            <p>Unique zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials are valuable for use in precision instruments, including electronics, aerospace parts, and engines. However, most ZTE materials have a temperature range less than 1000 K under which they do not expand.

The monoclinic structure of Mn2OBO3 remains stable over the entire temperature range in ambient conditions. Considerable thermal contraction on the BO3 trigonal planar and thermal expansion on the MnO6 octahedra combine to produce uniaxial ZTE. Temperature-dependent Raman scattering reveals anharmonic low-frequency modes associated with MnO6 Rigid Unit Modes (RUMs), which likely play a critical role in driving thermal contraction in the BO3 trigonal planar. No charge order-disorder transition, which could cause thermal contraction, was observed up to 1250 K.</p>

            <p>In this article we derive and test the fluctuating hydrodynamic description of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing, both for mono-disperse systems and for mixtures of co-existing species of active particles. We compute the average steady-state density profile in the presence of spatial motility regulation, as well as the structure factor and intermediate scattering function for interacting systems. By comparing our predictions to microscopic numerical simulations, we show that our fluctuating hydrodynamics correctly predicts the large-scale static and dynamical properties of the system. We also discuss how the theory breaks down when structures emerge at scales smaller or comparable to the persistence length of the particles. When the density field is the unique hydrodynamic mode of the system, we show that active Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles, interacting via quorum-sensing or chemotactic interactions, display undistinguishable large-scale properties. This form of universality implies an interesting robustness of the predicted physics but also that large-scale observations of patterns are insufficient to assess their microscopic origins. In particular, our results predict that chemotaxis-induced and motility-induced phase separation should share strong qualitative similarities at the macroscopic scale.</p>

We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.</p>

            <p>Prions are misfolded proteins that transmit their structural arrangement to neighboring proteins. In biological systems, prion dynamics can produce a variety of complex functional outcomes. Yet, an understanding of prionic causes has been hampered by the fact that few computational models exist that allow for experimental design, hypothesis testing, and control. Here, we identify essential prionic properties and present a biologically inspired model of prions using simple mechanical structures capable of undergoing complex conformational change. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by designing a prototypical mechanical prion and validating its properties experimentally. Our work provides a design framework for harnessing and manipulating prionic properties in natural and artificial systems.</p>

            <h2>Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zenan Dai, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Residual entropy, reflecting the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is important for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task due to computational challenges. In this Letter, we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our new approach to solve these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing many other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have thoroughly tested TIMC on several complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These difficulties arise from the singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability in calculating residual entropy could provide new insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Athanasios Koliogiorgos, Richard Korytár</p>
            <p>We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuelin Shao, Xi Dai</p>
            <p>We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.</p>

Competing interactions, even when not very strong, are known to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Pisegna, Suropriya Saha, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</p>

            <h2>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunchao Zhang, Xue-Yang Song, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</p>

            <h2>Preparation and readout of Majorana qubits in magnet-superconductor hybrid systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Crawford, Roland Wiesendanger, Stephan Rachel</p>
            <p>Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The parity of the Majorana state is converted to the presence or absence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state at the molecule. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground-state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the augmented Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.</p>

            <p>We explore the possibility to perform an in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in-situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in-situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand fundamental aspects of thermoelectricity, which is exemplary demonstrated by tracking the thermovoltage during in-situ crystallization of an amorphous Ge thin film. We propose an improved in-situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. The benefit of the in-situ approach is the possibility to directly correlate the thermoelectric properties with the structure and chemical composition of the entire studied device down to the atomic level, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects, and to trace its dynamic evolution upon heating or during the application of electrical currents</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</p>

            <p>Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>The dot product attention mechanism, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, is a cornerstone of modern Transformers. It adeptly captures semantic relationships between word pairs in sentences by computing a similarity overlap between queries and keys. In this work, we explore the suitability of Transformers, focusing on their attention mechanisms, in the specific domain of the parametrization of variational wave functions to approximate ground states of quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians. Specifically, we perform numerical simulations on the two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, a common benchmark in the field of quantum many-body systems on lattice. By comparing the performance of standard attention mechanisms with a simplified version that excludes queries and keys, relying solely on positions, we achieve competitive results while reducing computational cost and parameter usage. Furthermore, through the analysis of the attention maps generated by standard attention mechanisms, we show that the attention weights become effectively input-independent at the end of the optimization. We support the numerical results with analytical calculations, providing physical insights of why queries and keys should be, in principle, omitted from the attention mechanism when studying large systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the entanglement properties of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model from the perspective of the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ). The non-Bloch entanglement entropy is defined on a quasi-reciprocal lattice, obtained by performing an ordinary Fourier transformation on the non-Bloch Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the broken bulk-boundary correspondence is recovered in terms of the non-Bloch entanglement entropy. When the GBZ is circular, we show that the non-Bloch entanglement entropy is well-defined (real and positive-definite) in large parameter regions, except close to the exceptional points (EPs). In the critical region, we found that each Fermi point contributes precisely 1 to the central charge $c$ of the logarithmic scaling. At the EP, the central charge becomes negative due to the presence of the exceptional bound state. For the case of non-circular GBZ, long-range hopping emerges in the quasi-reciprocal lattice, and the von Neumann entropy on the GBZ is no longer real. However, the non-Bloch edge entanglement entropy remains real, which serves as a reliable topological indicator and respects the bulk-boundary correspondence. We compute the topological phase diagram, and reveal the critical behavior along the exceptional phase boundaries.</p>

            <p>Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</p>

The physics of this spatially modulated condensate is related to a spontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetries simultaneously, bearing strong similarities with the highly sought supersolid phase in Helium and ultracold atomic gases but with a novel mechanism typical of the driven-dissipative scenario. We then propose clear-cut and unequivocal experimental signatures that would allow to identify supersolidity phenomena in polariton condensates</p>

When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state. Accompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac points are transited into sextuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital coupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions.

            <p>Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.</p>

            <h2>Effects of heating strategies and ballistic transport on the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Zhang, Ziyang Xin, Qin Lou, Hong Liang</p>
            <p>Efficiently capturing the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in 3D FinFETs. However, most previous thermal simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating. Few studies are conducted for the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs with non-continuous heating, which is actually closer to the reality. To investigate the effects of heating strategies on the transient micro/nano scale thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs, three heating strategies are considered, including `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. A comparison is made between the phonon BTE solutions and the data predicted by the macroscopic diffusion equation, where the effect of boundary scattering on phonon transport is added into the effective thermal conductivity. Numerical results show that it is not easy to accurately capture the heat conduction in 3D FinFETs by the macroscopic diffusion equation, especially near the hotspot areas where ballistic phonon transport dominates and the temperature diffusion is no longer valid. Different heating strategies have great influence on the peak temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' or `Continuous' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.</p>

            <p>Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles increases remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analyzing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly-correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit where the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet collider provides critical insight into the interplay of confinement and interaction effects in small electron systems and highlights a new way to study engineered states of matter.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic <111> axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the Néel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Typicality, entropy and the generalization of statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernat Corominas-Murtra, Rudolf Hanel, Petr Jizba</p>
            <p>When at equilibrium, large-scale systems obey conventional thermodynamics because they belong to microscopic configurations (or states) that are typical. Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states -- the typical set -- alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system's statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the "thermalized" coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Renyi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, Gaspard Beaufort, David G. Cooke</p>
            <p>Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</p>

            <h2>Correlation stabilized anomalous Hall crystal in bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>When the charge density is sufficiently low, interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) would undergo a phase transition from homogeneous Fermi liquid to an electronic crystal state, known as Wigner crystal. Besides conventional 2DEG, various topological fermionic excitations may also be realized in 2D materials. For example, ``high-order" Dirac fermions exhibiting nontrivial Berry phases may approximately characterize the low-energy excitations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In this work, we develop a beyond-mean-field theoretical framework to study the interacting ground states and single-particle excitations in slightly charge-doped RMG under vertical electric field. We find that transitions from Fermi liquid to trivial Wigner-crystal states would occur at critical carrier density $\sim 10^{10}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for all $n$-layer RMG (with $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) which are approximately described by $n$-order Dirac-fermion models. Most saliently, using a more realistic modeling of bilayer graphene including trigonal warping effects, we find that an anomalous Hall crystal state with spontaneous quantized anomalous Hall conductivity would emerge when the carrier density is below $\sim 1\times 10^{11}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, and it becomes the unique ground state over trivial Wigner crystal when the density is further lower. Counter intuitively, such topological anomalous Hall crystal becomes more stable than the trivial Wigner crystal due to the lower correlation energy gained from dynamical charge fluctuations, which is beyond mean-field description. Our work suggests that slightly carrier-doped bilayer graphene is one of the most promising candidates to realize anomalous Hall crystal. Moreover, the method developed in this work can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems including moiré superlattices.</p>

            <h2>Disorder effects in a model of competing superconducting and charge-density wave orders in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dror Orgad</p>
            <p>There is evidence for competition between superconductivity and short-range charge-density wave order in a number of cuprate compounds and especially in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Here, we use a non-linear sigma model of such competition to study the effects of spatially correlated disorder in the chain layers and delta-correlated disorder in the CuO$_2$ layers. The first is relevant to the oxygen ortho structure and the latter may be induced by electron irradiation. We find that reducing the correlation length of the potential on the chain layers decreases the size of the charge-density wave structure factor but has little effect on its temperature dependence, as observed experimentally. At the same time, the charge-density wave correlation length decreases more than is seen in the experiment. The temperature at which the structure factor peaks coincides with $T_c$ and both decrease when disorder is introduced into the CuO$_2$ planes. Strengthening this disorder reduces the magnitude of the structure factor and eventually turns it into a monotonic function of the temperature. This occurs despite an increase in the local magnitude of the charge-density wave order.</p>

While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Lennart Schimpf, Ingrid Mertig</p>
            <p>The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current that is generated once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.</p>

            <p>Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Biaxial Strain on Cation Octahedral Rotations and Magnetic Structure of the Antiperovskite Mn$_{3}$GaN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Malyshev, Ingeborg-Helene Svenum, Sverre M. Selbach, Thomas Tybell</p>
            <p>Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5% to 5%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Using an AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in $T_S$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Analogous behavior was observed in cuprate superconductors, hinting at a possible link between the modified superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum (L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even at extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitudes. This highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects and rules out the possibility of local temperature increases affecting the measurements. To further confirm this, we conducted auxiliary experiments where a Cernox temperature sensor was subjected to ultrasonic excitation, and the resulting temperature difference relative to a reference Cernox was recorded. Simultaneously, the power difference was measured to assess the impact of ultrasonic heating. This analysis revealed that localized heating effects become dominant above an ultrasonic amplitude of 10 V$_{pp}$.</p>

Creases are known to form at the hydrogel surface during swelling; the wavelength of the creasing pattern is proportional to the initial thickness of the hydrogel film with a logarithmic correction that depends on microscopic properties of the hydrogel. We find that, although the characteristic wavelength of the pattern is determined during swelling, the surface morphology can be significantly influenced by evaporation-induced shrinking. We observe that the elastocapillary length based on swollen mechanical properties gives a threshold thickness for a surface pattern formation, and consequently an important change in morphology.</p>

            <p>Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</p>

When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</p>

            <p>We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the `quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of `out-of-time-ordered correlators'.</p>

            <p>The magnetic ground-state configuration of iron selenide FeSe has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting the stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. It is found that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground-state configuration with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. The present study underscores the importance of accurate XC functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground-state configuration of complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.</p>

            <p>We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8<T<15$ K and $T<8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.</p>

            <h2>LPCVD Grown Si-Doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films with Promising Electron Mobilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saleh Ahmed Khan, Ahmed Ibreljic, Stephen Margiotta, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan</p>
            <p>We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6° miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000°C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaorui Tan, Maolin Bo</p>
            <p>This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides.

            <h2>Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emin Aliyev, Arash Mobaraki, Hâldun Sevinçli, Seymur Jahangirov</p>
            <p>Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</p>

We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.</p>

            <h2>Maximum power Stirling-like heat engine with a harmonically confined Brownian particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Prieto-Rodríguez, Antonio Prados, Carlos A. Plata</p>
            <p>Heat engines transform thermal energy into useful work, operating in a cyclic manner. For centuries, they have played a key role in industrial and technological development. Historically, only gases and liquids have been used as working substances, but the technical advances achieved over the past decades allow for expanding the experimental possibilities and designing engines operating with a single particle. In this case, the system of interest cannot be addressed at a macroscopic level and their study is framed in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In the present work, we study mesoscopic heat engines built with a Brownian particle submitted to harmonic confinement and immersed in a fluid acting as a thermal bath. We design a Stirling-like heat engine, composed of two isothermal and two isochoric branches, by controlling both the stiffness of the harmonic trap and the temperature of the bath. Specifically, we focus on the irreversible, non quasi-static, case -- whose finite duration enables the engine to deliver a non-zero output power. This is a crucial aspect, which enables the optimisation of the thermodynamic cycle by maximising the delivered power -- thereby addressing a key goal at the practical level. The optimal driving protocols are obtained by using both variational calculus and optimal control theory tools. Also, we numerically explore the dependence of the maximum output power and the corresponding efficiency on the system parameters.</p>

            <h2>Quantized Hall conductivity in monolayer 1T^{\prime}-MoS_2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi</p>
            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of this material using spin texture, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity using linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a helical spin configuration with spin-momentum locking. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin-resolved Hall conductivity dominates, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley-resolved Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI) phase. Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. Finally, the Nernst coefficients (spin, valley, and total) are investigated at room temperature, revealing significant spin and valley-dependent transport properties. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices</p>

            <p>An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</p>

            <h2>Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dolev Haddad, H.A. Fertig, Efrat Shimshoni</p>
            <p>A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moiré lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</p>

            <p>By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</p>

We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers.

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</p>

            <h2>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska, Jon-Paul Maria, Long-Qing Chen, Venkatraman Gopalan</p>
            <p>Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</p>

            <p>We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPS). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with surprisingly heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, we find that this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results demonstrate that while accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is typically intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating phases of matter of many-body systems (macrostates). We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nixon Jerez-Lillo, Francisco A. Rodrigues, Paulo H. Ferreira, Pedro L. Ramos</p>
            <p>Scale-free networks play a fundamental role in the study of complex networks and various applied fields due to their ability to model a wide range of real-world systems. A key characteristic of these networks is their degree distribution, which often follows a power-law distribution, where the probability mass function is proportional to $x^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ typically ranging between $2 < \alpha < 3$. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian inference methods to obtain more accurate estimates than those obtained using traditional methods, which often yield biased estimates, and precise credible intervals. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that our approach provides nearly unbiased estimates for the scaling parameter, enhancing the reliability of inferences. We also evaluate new goodness-of-fit tests to improve the effectiveness of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, commonly used for this purpose. Our findings show that the Watson test offers superior power while maintaining a controlled type I error rate, enabling us to better determine whether data adheres to a power-law distribution. Finally, we propose a piecewise extension of this model to provide greater flexibility, evaluating the estimation and its goodness-of-fit features as well. In the complex networks field, this extension allows us to model the full degree distribution, instead of just focusing on the tail, as is commonly done. We demonstrate the utility of these novel methods through applications to two real-world datasets, showcasing their practical relevance and potential to advance the analysis of power-law behavior.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of quantum dot measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called $\textit{triangle plots}$, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is $\textit{good}$ and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of $\textit{bad}$ images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform (Schug $\textit{et al.}$ 2024 $\textit{Proc. XAI4Sci: Explainable Machine Learning for Sciences Workshop (AAAI 2024) (Vancouver, Canada)}$ pp 1-6). Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

            <p>The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</p>

            <h2>Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Mandal, Ajay Mohan</p>
            <p>We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</p>

            <h2>Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoxuan Ge, Sebastian Calderon, S. Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi</p>
            <p>The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</p>

            <p>We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, and the $l_1$-norm of coherence with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_{2} . 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $46\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. {It is evidenced that the aforementioned molecular complex with the magnetic core $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ provides an intriguing quantum resource, which exhibits a star-shaped state within the singlet eigenstate at low magnetic fields and W-like state within the triplet eigenstate at moderate magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Arian Zad, Jozef Strečka, Winfried Plass</p>
            <p>This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex $[\mathrm{Fe}_3\mathrm{Cl}_3(\mathrm{saltag^\mathrm{Br}})(\mathrm{py})_6]\mathrm{ClO}_4$ to be further abbreviated as Fe$_3$. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</p>

            <p>We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</p>

            <p>We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <h2>Information Scrambling with Higher-Form Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karunava Sil, Sourav Maji, Stavros Christodoulou, Abhishek Chowdhury</p>
            <p>The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling Thermal Properties in Multilayer Systems for Advanced Thermoreflectance Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Chen, Puqing Jiang</p>
            <p>Thermoreflectance techniques, including time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are powerful tools for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, accurately interpreting their signals remains challenging due to intricate interdependencies among experimental variables. This study introduces a systematic framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to decouple these interdependent parameters and enhance the reliability of thermal property extraction. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify key parameter combinations and establish essential dimensionless numbers that govern thermoreflectance signals. The framework is applied to a GaN/Si heterostructure, where the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS is evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate a high degree of consistency across all three techniques. Notably, with the intricate relationships of parameters unraveled, TDTR, FDTR, and SPS demonstrate significant potential to simultaneously and accurately extract five to seven key thermal properties, including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance of the GaN/Si multilayer system. This framework not only improves the precision of thermoreflectance measurements but also lays a foundation for advanced thermal metrology in research and industrial applications.</p>

The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</p>

This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraint are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.</p>

            <p>We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</p>

            <p>We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems</p>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</p>

            <p>Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps > 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Périce, Shahnaz Farhat, Sören Petrat</p>
            <p>The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</p>

            <p>In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yuan Wei, Tao Shi, J. Ignacio Cirac, Eugene A. Demler</p>
            <p>We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael F. Ribeiro, Luis Martinez-Gomez</p>
            <p>Topological matter shows promise for applications in quantum information and transport. In this work, we examined the electronic and vibronic properties of a prototype molecular system adsorbed to the edges, domain walls, and the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer Hegger polyacetylene chain in the trivial, metallic, and topological phases. Our results reveal that suitable molecular observables show signatures of the topological phase transition and imply the topological phase has a significant advantage and robustness over the metallic phase for electron donation into the molecular system. This advantage persists in the presence of defects and suggests applications of topological materials in molecular catalysis and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Quantum States at Chirality-Reversed Planar Interface in Weyl Semimetals using an Interstitial Layer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eklavya Thareja, Gina Pantano, Ilya Vekhter, Jacob Gayles</p>
            <p>The electronic band structure of Weyl semimetals possesses pairs of linear band crossings, called Weyl nodes, characterized by opposite chirality charges associated with each node. The momentum space position of the nodes can reverse across a planar interface and these host Fermi-arc-like bound states, in addition to scattering states. We show that a magnetic interstitial layer can tune these states in three distinct ways. The electrostatic potential and one of the in-plane magnetic potential components control the shape of the bound state Fermi-arcs. For moderate values of the same in-plane magnetic potential electrons are spin-filtered across the interface, while both the in-plane magnetic components and the electrostatic potential control the transmission of electrons. The ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic components can be used to turn on or turn off the magnetic potential effects, since the latter does not affect the interface states. The tunability arises from spin-momentum locking and chirality reversal at the interface. Thus, the effects can mix or interchange depending on the specific material but the states will remain tunable.</p>

            <h2>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Band structure evolution from kagome to Lieb under periodic driving field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gulshan Kumar, Shashikant Kumar, Prakash Parida</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the light-induced transition of the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb like band structure under periodic driving fields. A generalized framework for the renormalized hopping potential is derived, applicable to any two-dimensional lattice with arbitrary field polarizations. By applying this framework to a kagome lattice driven by linearly polarized light in off-resonant condition, we demonstrate the ability to tune the hopping strength along specific bonds to zero. This tuning induces the merging of Dirac points at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, governed by the field parameters. At specific parameter values, this merging facilitates a transition from the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb band structure with reduced bandwidth. Our results highlight the critical role of controlled electron hopping in driving this electronic transition, offering valuable insights into the manipulation of electronic properties in periodically driven systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Zhu, Meng Sun</p>
            <p>We investigate the light absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the light absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Nashaat, J. Tekić, Yu. M. Shukrinov</p>
            <p>Time crystals represent a non-equilibrium state of matter with broken time-translation symmetry that repeats itself at regular time intervals. Though initially envisioned as a self-generated and self-sustained periodic motion, their realization has usually required the utilization of external periodic inputs or modulations. While at first it looked like, for a time crystal to exist, the initial proposal had to be abandoned, the recent evidence of inherent time crystals is bringing back the idea of self-generated time crystal under the spotlight. In this work, we demonstrate the appearance of a self-generated space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions with the ferromagnet interface without any external influence. The presence of the exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modifies the current phase relation and the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry leading to the appearance of the time-crystalline order in the spatiotemporal dependence of superconducting current, which evolves with the double of the modulation frequency. Due to its unique origin and properties, this inherent time crystalline order stands out from the commonly known classification of time crystals into discrete and continuous ones. A self-generated time crystal is demonstrated in two types of hybrid Josephson junctions: the superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor on a topological insulator and the superconductor-three layer ferromagnet-superconductor. Further, we also show that a recently developed magnetometry device that visualizes a supercurrent flow in the Josephson junction at the nanoscale can be used as a platform for experimental detection of space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>The quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting from a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) system non-linearly coupled with a leaking single-mode micro-resonator is theoretically investigated. The focus is on the resonance condition when the transition frequency of the double quantum dot equals to the doubled resonator frequency, respectively, and the resulting interplay among the involved phonon or photon channels. As a result, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibits a variety of possible effects that have been demonstrated here. Particularly, we have found the relationship among the electrical current through the double quantum dot and the microwave field inside the resonator that is nonlinearly coupled to it, with a corresponding emphasizing on their critical behaviors. Additionally, the quantum correlations of the photon flux generated into the resonator mode vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, leading to single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile source of single photons with tunable properties to be used in quantum-cryptographic applications. A crucial figure of merit of the emitted photons is photon number coherence (PNC), which impacts the security of many quantum communication protocols. In the process of single-photon generation, the quantum dot as a solid-state object is subject to an interaction with phonons, which can therefore indirectly affect the PNC. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of PNC in optically excited quantum dots and how it is affected by phonons. In contrast to the expectation that phonons always deteriorate coherence, PNC can be increased in a quantum dot-cavity system due to the electron-phonon interaction.</p>

We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</p>

            <p>Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.</p>

            <p>How neurons integrate the myriad synaptic inputs scattered across their dendrites is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. These non-linearities have motivated mathematical descriptions of single neuron as a two-layer computational units, which have been shown to increase substantially the computational abilities of neurons, compared to linear dendritic integration. However, current analytical studies are restricted to neurons with unconstrained synaptic weights and unplausible dendritic non-linearities. Here, we introduce a two-layer model with sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, and investigate its properties using both statistical physics methods and numerical simulations. We find that the dendritic non-linearity enhances both the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity. We characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We calculate analytically the distribution of synaptic weights in networks close to maximal capacity, and find that a large fraction of zero-weight ('silent' or 'potential') synapses naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses, as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. We test our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets and observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.</p>

            <p>In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</p>

Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</p>

In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Thermally-driven semi-crystalline polymer networks are capable to achieve both the one-way shape-memory effect and two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions, therefore representing an appealing class of polymers for applications requiring autonomous reversible actuation and shape changes. In these materials, the shape-memory effects are achieved by leveraging the synergistic interaction between one or more crystalline phases and the surrounding amorphous ones that are present within the network itself. The present paper introduces a general framework for the finite strain continuum phenomenological modeling of the thermo-mechanical and shape-memory behavior of multi-phase semi-crystalline polymer networks. Model formulation, including the definition of phase and control variables, kinematic assumptions, and constitutive specifications, is introduced and thoroughly discussed. Theoretical derivations are general and easily adaptable to all cross-linked systems which include two or more crystalline domains or a single crystalline phase with a wide melting range and manifest macroscopically the one-way shape-memory effect and the two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions. Model capabilities are validated against experimental data for copolymer networks with two different crystalline phases characterized by well-separated melting and crystallization transitions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting all the phenomena involved and in furnishing a useful support for future material and application design purposes.</p>

For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode.

            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</p>

            <h2>Catalytic activity of Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Kumar Yadav, Mohammad Abu Shaz, Thakur Prasad Yadav</p>
            <p>Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for hydrogen storage because of its abundance and beneficial properties, such as high storage capacity and cost-effectiveness under mild conditions. Despite of these benefits, MgH2 unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics make it difficult to use in real applications. In this work, the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2have been improved using Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy (HEA) based catalysts, which has been synthesized via mechanical alloying. The experimental findings show that the beginning desorption temperature of MgH2significantly lowered from 425°C to 180°C by adding 5 wt. % Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA in MgH2. Moreover, the catalyst shows enhanced kinetics, attaining 7.3 wt. % hydrogen absorption in 3 minutes at 320°C with 15 atm hydrogen pressure, and ~5 wt. % desorption in 6 minutes at 320°C. These results highlight, how much lower its desorption temperature is than those of other well-known catalysts. Over a span of 25 cycles, MgH2 catalyzed by Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA exhibits remarkable cyclic stability with negligible fluctuations (~ 0.05 wt. %).After a thorough characterization of the materials, a workable catalytic mechanism for HEA was proposed in light of the results.</p>

            <h2>Single-Atom Catalysis: An Opportunity For Surface Science</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gareth S. Parkinson</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, extensive research into single-atom catalysts (SACs) has revealed that the catalytic behavior of metal adatoms is highly dependent on how they interact with their support. A strong dependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisons with metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about the potential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. The rise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metal combinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking of theoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, and the impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. The surface science approach is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atom and interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects of temperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stability can be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studies tested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemical setups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specific systems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nitrides, where insights from surface science experiments can significantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zu-En Su, Dan Cogan, Ido Schwartz, Ayal Beck, David Gershoni</p>
            <p>We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.</p>

            <h2>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyao Huang, Xinfang Zhang, Xiaofeng Yi, Jibang Fu, Weichen Wang, Mingtang Deng</p>
            <p>Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</p>

            <p>The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open a new avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle.

We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</p>

            <p>Generative models generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials, necessitating fast, accurate models for property prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in this domain but face challenges like high training costs, domain adaptation issues, and over-smoothing.

DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction, approaching X-ray diffraction method accuracy.

            <p>Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.</p>

The optical transitions between the ground state (Z) and excited state (Y) manifolds of the environmentally shielded 4f states of these Er3+ ions have wavelengths ~1.5 microns and thus have potential applications to quantum communications and quantum memories. These results are in excellent agreement with recent low-temperature measurements, provided the inadequate calculation of the 4f shell screening is adjusted by reducing the radial extent of the 4f wavefunctions by approximately a factor of 2.</p>

            <p>We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elia Stocco, Maria Barbara Maccioni, Andrea Floris, Matteo Cococcioni</p>
            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulations of defects near the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijaya Begum-Hudde, Yi-Ting Lee, Barbara A. Jones, André Schleife</p>
            <p>Defects in materials are ubiquitous and one of their adverse effects in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is the initiation of corrosion. While this process starts near the surface, the defects involved and their electronic structure need to be elucidated with high accuracy. Since point defects are confined to a small spatial region, defect embedding theory allows the definition of an active space, comprising of the defect electronic states, that is coupled to the environment of the host material. The active space Hamiltonian is of small rank, enabling access to its electronic properties using a high-level or even exact quantum theory. In this paper we use these techniques and first-principles simulations to compute the structural and electronic properties of near-surface vacancies for the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$, and investigate the influence of defects and hydration on the initiation and propagation of corrosion. We report the defect electronic structure for strongly localized ground and excited states of the surface O vacancy and compare results obtained using full configuration interaction and a variational quantum eigensolver on a quantum computer. Error mitigation techniques are explored and shown to reduce the error due to the hardware noise to the point where the quantum result agrees with the exact solution within chemical accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Zero Field Antiferromagnetically Coupled Skyrmions and their Field-Driven Uncoupling in Composite Chiral Multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> May Inn Sim, Dickson Thian, Ramu Maddu, Xiaoye Chen, Hang Khume Tan, Chao Li, Pin Ho, Anjan Soumyanarayanan</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions are topological spin structures with fully compensated, net-zero magnetization. Compared to their ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion counterparts, their reduced stray field and enhanced electrical response can enable linear, high-throughput current-driven motion. However, their bubble-like character in conventional bilayer AFs limits their stability to fluctuations, leading to deformation and annihilation. Here we present the engineering of a composite AF chiral multilayer, wherein the interplay of AF and FM interlayer couplings generates compensated skyrmions with compact structures. High-resolution magnetic imaging and micromagnetic simulations show that the internal exchange field stabilizes AF skyrmions at zero external field with characteristics comparable to FM counterparts at 100 mT. Quantitative analyses establish their decoupling above the exchange field, yielding independent, spatially segregated textures in constituent chiral layers. This work provides a foundation to develop AF spin-textures with enhanced immunity, compatible with efficient readout and manipulation, with relevance to unconventional computing.</p>

            <p>Pressure is a powerful thermodynamic parameter for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we introduce a method enabling in situ magnetic imaging of van der Waals magnets under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach relies on a quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which can be placed in atomic contact of any type of two-dimensional (2D) material within a van der Waals heterostructure. We first show that the V$_\text{B}^-$ center can be used as a magnetic field sensor up to pressures of a few GPa, a pressure range for which the properties of a wide variety of van der Waals magnets are efficiently altered. We then use V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in a thin hBN layer to perform magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under pressure. As a proof of concept, we study the pressure-dependent magnetization in micrometer-sized flakes of $1T$-CrTe$_2$, whose evolution is explained by a shift of the Curie temperature. Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.</p>

            <h2>The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giancarlo Soavi, Jan Wilhelm</p>
            <p>Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods.

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <p>Unravelling the mechanism behind bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal films has proven challenging. This is largely due to the inherent complexity of amorphous structure and the entangled potential origins arising from microstructure and atomic structure factors. Here, we present an approach wherein the magneto-electric effect is harnessed to induce 90° switching of bulk PMA in Tb-Co films to in-plane directions by applying voltages of only -1.2 V. This manipulation is achieved by voltage-driven insertion of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, which serves as a perturbation to local atomic structure. Using angle-dependent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the distortion of crystal field around Tb which reorients the alignment of Tb orbital moments. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90°, as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only concludes the atomic origin of Tb-Co atom bonding configuration in shaping bulk PMA, but also establishes the groundwork for electrically programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, such as controlling domain wall motion and programming artificial spin textures.</p>

            <p>Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</p>

Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture. Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</p>

            <p>The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</p>

            <p>Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</p>

            <h2>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muneki Yasuda, Ryosuke Maeno, Chako Takahashi</p>
            <p>In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick Pant, Rob Armitage, Emmanouil Kioupakis</p>
            <p>III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pete Rigas</p>
            <p>We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</p>

            <p>Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</p>

Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shize Cao, Feng Jin, Yun-Ze Long, Jianlin Luo, Qingming Zhang, Zhi-Guo Chen</p>
            <p>The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.</p>

            <p>CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.</p>

            <p>Despite several theoretical predictions regarding the physics and application of quantum wells (QWs) of topological crystalline insulators (TCI), no quantized charge transport via helical or chiral edge states has been experimentally demonstrated for such a class of systems. In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, the Berry phases, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, a reduced strength of electron-electron interactions will result in the absence of unpaired localized spins in the topological gap and, thus, in a substantially longer topological protection length compared to the quantum spin Hall materials explored so far.</p>

            <p>Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism.

            <p>The diversity of 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) stacking presents a fertile ground for engineering novel multifunctional materials and quantum states of matter. This permits unique opportunities to tailor the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures by the insertion of only a single 2D material layer. However, such vdW materials engineering at the atomic scale has yet to be investigated for spin-charge interconversion phenomena. Here, we report on the control of these effects at the monolayer level, where drastic increase in intensity and change in sign of THz spintronic emission are demonstrated by inserting a single layer of MoSe$_2$ between PtSe$_2$ and graphene in a fully epitaxial, large area stacked structure. By using a combination of spin and angle resolved photoemission and density functional theory to reveal the electronic and spin structures, we illustrate two different mechanisms relying on charge transfer and electronic hybridization for the formation of Rashba states, which are responsible for spin-charge conversion and hence the THz spintronic emission. These findings open new pathways to design, at the atomic scale, efficient THz spintronic emitters made of 2D materials and other spintronic devices based on spin-charge interconversion phenomena.</p>

            <p>In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.</p>

            <p>In this work, we predict the emergence of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in conventional semiconductors, specifically InAs quantum wells, driven by a built-in polarization field. We propose QSHI InAs quantum wells as a platform to engineer topological field effect devices. More precisely, we first present a novel topological logic device that operates without a topological phase transition. Subsequently, we design a high-performance topological transistor due to the presence of edge states. Our approach provides a potential framework for harnessing the unique features of QSHI in device design, paving the way for future topological devices.</p>

            <h2>Topology meets time-reversal symmetry breaking in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ superconductor</h2>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Magneto-transport and Anisotropic Multigap Superconductivity in Architecturally Misfit Layered System (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$</h2>

            <p>Misfit-layered compounds, naturally occurring bulk heterostructures, present a compelling alternative to artificially engineered ones, offering a unique platform for exploring correlated phases and quantum phenomena. This study investigates the magnetotransport and superconducting properties of the misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$, comprising alternating PbS and 1$H$-TaS$_2$ layers. It exhibits distinctive transport properties, including a prominent planar Hall effect and a four-fold oscillatory Butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Moreover, it shows multigap two-dimensional superconductivity with an exceptionally high in-plane upper critical field, exceeding the Pauli limit. The coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and anomalous transport - two distinct quantum phenomena, within the same material, suggests that misfit compounds provide an ideal platform for realizing quantum effects in the two-dimensional limit of bulk crystals. This opens the door to the development of simpler and more efficient quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Ensemble-averaged mean-field many-body level density: an indicator of integrable versus chaotic single-particle dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Maier, Carolyn Echter, Juan Diego Urbina, Caio Lewenkopf, Klaus Richter</p>
            <p>According to the quantum chaos paradigm, the nature of a system's classical dynamics, whether integrable or chaotic, is universally reflected in the fluctuations of its quantum spectrum. However, since many-body spectra in the mean field limit are composed of independent single-particle energy levels, their spectral fluctuations always display Poissonian behavior and hence cannot be used to distinguish underlying chaotic from integrable single-particle dynamics. We demonstrate that this distinction can, instead, be revealed from the mean many-body level density (at fixed energy) and its variance after averaging over ensembles representing different types of single-particle dynamics. This is in strong contrast to the energy-averaged mean level density (of a given system) that is assumed not to carry such information and is routinely removed to focus on universal signatures. To support our claim we systematically analyze the role of single-particle level correlations, that enter through Poisson and random matrix statistics (of various symmetry classes) into the ensemble-averaged density of states and its variance, contrasting bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. Our analytical study, together with extensive numerical simulations for systems with $N \ge 5$ particles consistently reveal significant differences (up to an order of magnitude for fermions and even larger for bosons) in the mean many-body level densities, depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics. Notably, in the fermionic case Poisson-type single-particle level fluctuations precisely cancel contributions from indistinguishability, such that the average many-body spectral density equals the (Thomas-Fermi) volume term. We further highlight the difference between the mean level density and its variance as functions of the total energy $E$ and the excitation energy $Q$.</p>

            <p>High-energy bursts in superconducting quantum circuits from various radiation sources have recently become a practical concern due to induced errors and their propagation in the chip. The speed and distance of these disturbances have practical implications. We used a linear array of multiplexed MKIDs on a single silicon chip to measure the propagation velocity of a localized high-energy burst, introduced by driving a Normal metal- Insulator-Superconductor (NIS) junction. We observed a reduction in the apparent propagation velocity with NIS power, which is due to the combined effect of reduced phonon flux with distance and the existence of a minimum detectable QP density in the MKIDs. A simple theoretical model is fitted to extract the longitudinal phonon velocity in the substrate and the conversion efficiency of phonons to QPs in the superconductor.</p>

            <h2>Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivalika Sharma, Liviu Chioncel, Igor Di Marco</p>
            <p>Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</p>

            <p>Electrocatalytic processes occurring at the heterogeneous interface are complex and their understanding at the molecular level remains challenging. Atomic force microscope (AFM) can detect force interactions down to the atomic level, but so far it has been mainly used to obtain in-situ images of electrocatalysts. Here for the first time, we employ AFM to investigate gas evolution at a platinum ultramicroelectrode (Pt UME) under electrochemical conditions using the force noise method. We detect excess force noise when the individual H2 gas bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment events occur at the Pt UME. The excess noise varies linearly with the applied potential on a semi-log plot. Chronoamperometry current fluctuations indicate that the H2 gas bubble radius increases from 1 to 10 micrometers and the AFM deflection signal measurements indicate that the mean H2 bubble radius is 321 micrometers. These two values point to the coalescence of small bubbles generated at the Pt UME interface. The contribution reports an innovative method to probe the gas bubble dynamics at the heterogenous interface under electrochemical conditions with high sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Advancement of solid state electrolytes (SSEs) for all solid state batteries typically focuses on modification of a parent structural framework for improved conductivity, \textit{e.g.} cation substitution for an immobile ion or varying the concentration of the mobile ion. Therefore, novel frameworks can be disruptive by enabling fast ion conduction aided by different structure and diffusion mechanisms, and unlocking optimal conductors with different properties (\textit{e.g.} mechanical properties, sintering needs, electrochemical stability) than previously published. Herein, we perform a high throughput survey of an understudied structural framework for sodium ion conduction, Na$_{8-x}$A$^x$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP), to understand the family's thermodynamic stability, synthesizability, and ionic conduction. We first show that the parent phase Na$_4$TiP$_2$O$_9$ (NTP) undergoes a structural distortion (with accompanying conductivity transition) due to unstable phonons from a pseduo-Jahn Teller mode in the 1D titanium chains. Then, screening of cation-substituted structural candidates with \textit{ab initio} and machine-learned potential calculations reveal a number of candidates that are thermodynamically stable, likely synthesizable, and have high predicted ionic conductivities. High throughput experimental trials and subsequent methodology optimization of one Na$_4$SnP$_2$O$_9$ (NSP) highlight collective challenges to the synthesis pathways for sodium phosphate materials via solid state synthesis. Our results demonstrate that NAP is a highly tunable conduction framework whose high temperature conductivity transition has heretofore eliminated it from significant research interest. By expanding the structural toolkit for SSE design, we increase the number of useful sodium ion electrolytes for integration into safe and accessible solid state batteries.</p>

            <p>The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250°C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling Cation-Polyanion Coupling in Solid Electrolytes: Which Anion Motion Dominates Cation Transport?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Li, Jitai Yang, Yu Zhai, Hui Li</p>
            <p>Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p>The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</p>

            <p>Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is mentioned.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Sappington, Vaibhav Mohanty</p>
            <p>Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</p>

However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials.

We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the Néel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics research and application.</p>

            <p>Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.</p>

            <p>We propose harnessing the tools of modern nano-fabrication to provide electrical control of exciton-polariton (EP) condensates. We develop the theory of a device based on the Josephson effect in which electric fields can be used to both switch between and monitor various dynamical modes. In particular, both the bias potential and the Josephson energy can be tuned electrically via the exciton component. We model the device by a Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through degrees of freedom not easily accessible in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions. The ability to control and monitor the condensate by both optical and electrical means allows new ways to study its physics not possible by either, alone.</p>

            <p>We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-Rényi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the Rényi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-Rényi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</p>

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the FeGe films are epitaxial to the substrate. Unlike the antiferromagnetic bulk, the monoclinic FeGe films are ferromagnetic with Curie-temperature as high as ~ 800 K, contributing to the anomalous Hall effect in the transport measurements. Similar to the hexagonal FeGe, we captured a structural phase transition in the monoclinic FeGe films at ~ 100 K in real and reciprocal spaces by transmission electron microscope. Our work enriches the phase diagram of the FeGe family and suggests that FeGe offers an ideal platform for studying multiphase transitions and related device applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Ming Xie, Hiroki Isobe, Naoto Nagaosa</p>
            <p>The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.</p>

            <h2>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Bergshoeff, Andrea Campoleoni, Giandomenico Palumbo, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo</p>
            <p>Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</p>

            <p>Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.</p>

Definitions of these functionals are provided, and characteristic functions are presented for the model with an exponential distribution of incoming demands. A generalization of these limitations is also considered. The potential uses of boundary functionals are demonstrated through examples such as a unicyclic network with affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion, two-level model, Brownian motion, and multiple diffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.</p>

Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao</p>
            <p>The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baopi Liu, Lu Chen, Ji Zhang</p>
            <p>The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyuan Yang, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transmission properties of a junction between a normal metal and a p-wave magnet in the ballistic regime. We introduce a two-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave magnet criteria. The $\alpha$-vector of the magnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the parabolic dispersion, shifting them in $k$-space. These shifts alter the propagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface. Depending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic, angle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between fermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a transverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we show that the $\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the spin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the conductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission characteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave magnet junctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a new "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adham Alkady, Victor Fleurov, Anatoly Kuklov</p>
            <p>Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Liu, Jiayin Gu</p>
            <p>Three types of cycles are identified in the quantum jump trajectories of the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois (SSDB) machine: an R-cycle as refrigeration, an H-cycle as a heat engine, and an N-cycle in which the machine is neutral. The statistics of these cycles are investigated via a semi-Markov process method. We find that in the large time limit, whether the machine operates as a heat engine or refrigerator depends on the ratio between the numbers of R-cycles and H-cycles per unit time. Further increasing the hot bath temperature above a certain threshold does not increase the machine's power output. The cause is that, in this situation, the N-cycle has a greater probability than the H-cycle and R-cycle. Although the SSDB machine operates by randomly switching between these three cycles, at the level of a single quantum jump trajectory, its heat engine efficiency and the refrigerator's coefficient of performance remain constant.</p>

            <p>We present an approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering an alternative perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena such as superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($>10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong-Hao Wang, Yan-Bin Yang, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</p>

We focus first on a simple elastic network model with connectivity matrices (CMs) which are either annealed or quenched, at or out of equilibrium. The stress-fluctuation formalism relation for $\mu$ is rewritten as $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_a$ with $\mu_1 \ge 0$ characterizing the variance of the quenched shear stresses and $\mu_a$ being a simple average over all states and CMs. For equilibrium CM-distributions $\mu_a$ becomes equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed systems, i.e. $\mu_a \ge 0$, while more generally $\mu_a$ may become strongly negative as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model. Consistent relations are also found for glass-forming colloids where $\mu-\mu_1=\mu_a=0$ for equilibrium ensembles, i.e. $\mu$ is set by the quenched shear stresses, while $\mu_a$ becomes again negative otherwise.</p>

In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.</p>

            <p>Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1<\alpha<3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.</p>

This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</p>

            <p>The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.</p>

            <h2>Defect engineering in two-dimensional pentagonal PdTe$_2$: Tuning electronic, optical, and magnetic properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Poonam Sharma, Vaishali Roondhe, Alok Shukla</p>
            <p>Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.</p>

            <h2>The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Simon, Luc Belloni, Daniel Borgis, Martin Oettel</p>
            <p>We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.</p>

            <p>Challenge to control the quantum states of matter via light have been at the forefront of modern research on driven quantum matter. We explore the imprinting effects of structured light on superconductors, demonstrating how the quantum numbers of light-specifically spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and radial order-can be transferred to the superconducting order parameter and control vortex dynamics. Using Laguerre-Gaussian beams, we show that by tuning the quantum numbers and the amplitude of the electric field, it is possible to manipulate a variety of vortex behaviors, including breathing vortex pairs, braiding vortex pairs, vortex droplets, supervortices, and swirling 2D vortex rings. More complex structure of vortex-clusters, such as vortex-flake structures, and standing wave motions, also emerge under specific quantum numbers. These results demonstrate the ability to control SC vortex motion and phase structures through structured light, offering potential applications in quantum fluids and optical control of superconducting states. Our findings present a diagram that links light's quantum numbers to the resulting SC vortex behaviors, highlighting the capacity of light to transfer its symmetry onto superconducting condensates. We point that this approach represents the extension of the printing to quantum printing by light in a coherent state of electrons.</p>

            <p>We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</p>

            <p>A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Austin Kaczmarek, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Katja C. Nowack</p>
            <p>We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic collinear antiferromagnet with hidden altermagnetic split</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Matsuda, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.</p>

            <p>"Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</p>

            <p>The development of solid-state batteries (SSBs) is hindered by degradation at solid-solid interfaces due to void formation and contact loss, resulting in increased impedance. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of real and unrecoverable interfacial contact areas at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface in driving the impedance rise. By controlling contact geometries and applied pressures, we identify their distinct contributions to the impedance spectra and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and transport. Experiments reveal that interfacial resistance varies strongly with recoverable contact area and applied pressure following power law scaling, with exponents of -1 and -0.5, respectively. Moreover, distributed contacts result in lower impedance due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Continuum simulations of the contact geometries predict interfacial resistances in agreement with experiments. Our work highlights the influence of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses on SSB impedance while quantifying the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.</p>

            <h2>Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <p>Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation this http URL, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Thomas Barthel</p>
            <p>Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.</p>

            <h2>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</p>

When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra.

We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</p>

            <p>Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.</p>

These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$.

We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d < 4$. Our results show that $N_c> 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition.

            <p>Quantum tunneling is a quantum phenomenon in which a microscopic object crosses through a potential barrier even if its energy cannot overcome the barrier. A general belief is that tunneling occurs only when the barrier width is comparable to, or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, we study the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice and present a mechanism to realize long-range tunneling. We find that, mediated by the propagating matter wave emitted from the atom, coherent tunneling of the atom to the remote lattices occurs as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Going beyond the Markovian approximation, and breaking through the conventional distance constraint, our result opens another avenue to realizing tunneling and gives a guideline to developing tunneling devices.</p>

            <p>We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</p>

            <p>We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</p>

            <p>We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</p>

            <h2>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xin Sha, Ming-Yao Xia, Ling Lu, Yi Yang</p>
            <p>Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <h2>Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahan Mohseni, Iann Cunha, Daniel Miravet, Alina Wania Rodrigues, Hassan Allami, Ibsal Assi, Marek Korkusinski, Pawel Hawrylak</p>
            <p>This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Agnostic Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic-Crystal Structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Bahulikar, Feng Wang, Mustafa Cenk Gursoy, Rodrick Kuate Defo</p>
            <p>We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures and to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</p>

            <h2>Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Nakayama</p>
            <p>Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Shachar</p>
            <p>We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.</p>

            <h2>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius de Leeuw, Vera Posch</p>
            <p>In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</p>
