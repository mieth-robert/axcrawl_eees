            <h2>Coherent Optical Control of Electron Dynamics in Patterned Graphene Nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riek H. Rüstemeier, H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.</p>

            <h2>Theory of non-resonant Raman scattering from electrons in nodal and flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Predrag Nikolić</p>
            <p>Raman scattering is emerging as a surprising probe of electron topology in quantum materials. It has been used recently to detect and characterize a topological phase transition that accompanies the magnetic transition in Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Here we present a theory of Raman scattering from nodal electrons with Weyl and quadratic band touching spectra, which has to reach beyond the standard effective mass approximation. After reviewing and providing the details of our previous theory development, we discuss several new results. We show that the light-polarization dependence of Raman scattering is universal in the case of Weyl electrons and given by an analytic expression, while it contains symmetry-protected features in the case of quadratic band-touching nodes. We also analyze modifications of the Raman signal due to the ubiquitous tilting of the Weyl spectrum, and argue that universality is lost only in a finite frequency range that springs out of the threshold frequency for untilted nodes. Finally, we explore the frequency dependence of Raman scattering for the case of Dirac electrons coexisting with a flat band in the same region of the first Brillouin zone, which is inspired by the material V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced pseudo-magnetic fields in three-dimensional topological semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpit Raj, Swati Chaudhary, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Maia G. Vergniory, Roni Ilan, Gregory A. Fiete</p>
            <p>In this work, we show that suitably designed spatially varying linearly polarized light provides a versatile route to generate and control pseudo-magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals through Floquet engineering. Within a high-frequency expansion, we derive an effective axial gauge potential $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$ whose curl gives the pseudo-magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_5(\mathbf{r})$. By mapping the light profile to $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$, we establish design principles for pseudo-magnetic field textures that mimic strain-induced gauge fields while offering key advantages like dynamic control, full reversibility, spatial selectivity, and absence of material deformation. We compare the Landau-level spectra produced by uniform real and pseudo-magnetic fields and also analyze both their linear optical conductivity and the second-order dc responses. Our results enable real-time manipulation of pseudo-magnetic fields and predict clear experimental signatures for optically engineered gauge fields in topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Hidden integer quantum ferroelectricity in chiral Tellurium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Luo, Sihan Deng, Muting Xie, Junyi Ji, Hongjun Xiang, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Ferroelectricity is a cornerstone of functional materials research, enabling diverse technologies from non-volatile memory to optoelectronics. Recently, type-I integer quantum ferroelectricity (IQFE), unconstrained by symmetry, has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated; however, as it arises from ionic displacements of an integer lattice vector, the initial and final states are macroscopically indistinguishable, rendering the physical properties unchanged. Here, we propose for the first time the nontrivial counterpart (i.e., type-II IQFE) where the polarization difference between the initial and final states is quantized but the macroscopical properties differ. We further demonstrate the existence of type-II IQFE in bulk chiral tellurium. In few-layer tellurium, the total polarization remains nearly quantized, composed of a bulk-inherited quantum component and a small surface-induced contribution. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal surface-initiated, layer-by-layer switching driven by reduced energy barriers, explaining why ferroelectricity was observed experimentally in few-layer tellurium, but not in bulk tellurium yet. Interestingly, the chirality of the initial and final states in bulk tellurium is opposite, suggesting a novel way to control structural chirality with electric field in chiral photonics and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory devices.</p>

            <h2>High-Throughput Screening of Transition Metal-Based 2D Multilayer Kagome Materials via the "1 + 3" Design Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Yu Wang, En-Qi Bao, Su-Yang Shen, Jun-Hui Yuan, Jiafu Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials have drawn extensive research interest due to their unique electronic properties, like flat bands, magnetic frustration, and topological quantum states, which enable precise quantum state control and novel device innovation. Yet, simultaneously achieving high stability, tunability, and multifunctionality in 2D kagome systems remains a key material design challenge. In this study, we innovatively propose a new paradigm for constructing two-dimensional multi-kagome-layer materials based on the "1+3" design concept. By seamlessly integrating high-throughput screening techniques, we have successfully identified 6,379 novel 2D multilayer kagome candidates from a vast pool of candidates. These materials exhibit a rich diversity of types, encompassing 173 metals, 27 semimetals, 166 ferromagnetic semiconductors, and as many as 6,013 semiconductors. Furthermore, based on the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, we conducted a detailed analysis of the flat-band characteristics of the energy bands near the Fermi level in the predicted systems. Our findings reveal that approximately two-thirds of the systems meet the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, and notably, several systems exhibit nearly perfect flat-band characteristics. Our work provides an excellent paradigm for the design and research of 2D multilayer kagome materials</p>

            <h2>Chern insulators and topological flat bands in cavity-embedded kagome systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hikaru Goto, Ryo Okugawa, Takami Tohyama</p>
            <p>We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</p>

            <h2>Parametric Drive of a Double Quantum Dot in a Cavity</h2>

            <p>We demonstrate the parametric modulation of a double quantum dot charge dipole coupled to a cavity, at the cavity frequency, achieving an amplified readout signal compared to conventional dispersive protocols. Our findings show that the observed cavity field displacement originates from dipole radiation within the cavity, rather than from a longitudinal coupling mechanism, yet exhibits the same signatures while relying on a transverse coupling. By carefully tuning the phase and amplitude of the intra-cavity field, we achieve a $\pi$-phase shift between two dipole states, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to its applications in quantum dot based qubits in cQED architectures, this protocol could serve as a new promising tool for probing exotic electronic states in mesoscopic circuits embedded in cavities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fluctuation-induced first-order breaking of time-reversal symmetry in unconventional superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Shi</p>
            <p>Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors with competing non-degenerate pairing channels is an exotic quantum phase transition that could give rise to robust topological superconductivity and unusual magnetism. It is proposed mostly in two-dimensional systems and is signaled by a nonzero relative phase between the two superconducting order parameters, hence it should particularly be prone to order-parameter phase fluctuations. Nevertheless, the existing understanding of it is still at the mean-field level. Here, we illustrate the non-negligible effects of the phase fluctuations on such quantum phase transitions using the hole-doped square-lattice $t$-$J$ model as an example. We derive the phase fluctuation-corrected free energy and show that under the quantum phase fluctuations, the time-reversal asymmetric $s+id$ phase region splits off a dome featuring a first-order border with the $d$ phase, indicating the possibility of a phase separation into the time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric phases. The phase fluctuations also narrow the range of the $s+id$ phase considerably. We further discuss the implications of our findings for recent experiments on disorder-induced first-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity and promising high-temperature topological superconductivity in twisted cuprate Josephson junctions.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Chern Insulator States with Coexisting Magnonic and Electronic Topology in 2D Honeycomb Kitaev Ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haozhou Cai, Zhiming Xu, Jian Wu, Weiyi Pan</p>
            <p>The coexistence of topological magnons and electrons in magnetic materials presents a compelling route toward developing low-dissipation, multifunctional spintronic devices. However, material systems enabling their simultaneous realization and control remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose the coexistence and concurrent tunability of magnonic and electronic Chern insulator phases in Kitaev magnets and use MnBr$_{3}$ monolayer as a prototype. We find the significant Kitaev interaction in MnBr$_{3}$ induces the magnonic Chern insulator phase, manifesting as the magnon thermal Hall effect. Concurrently, MnBr$_{3}$ exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect driven by its electronic Chern insulator phase. Crucially, we demonstrate that these dual topological phases can be simultaneously controlled by reorienting the in-plane spins with an external magnetic field. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of spin excitations in Kitaev magnets but also provide a promising platform for exploring the interplay between electronic and magnonic topology.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Materials for Quantum Magnonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rostyslav O. Serha, Carsten Dubs, Andrii V. Chumak</p>
            <p>Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Configurational Entropy-Driven Phase Stability and Thermal Transport in Rock-Salt High-Entropy Oxides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Kumar, Adrien Moll, Jitendra Kumar, Diana Dragoe, David Bérardan, Nita Dragoe</p>
            <p>High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer a unique platform for exploring the thermodynamic interaction between configurational entropy and enthalpy in stabilizing complex solid solutions. In this study, a series of rock-salt structured oxides with varying configurational entropy, ranging from binary to multi-cation systems, to elucidate the competing roles of enthalpy and entropy in phase stabilization is investigated. Compositions including (Ni$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)O to(NiCuZnCoMg)$_{0.9}$A$_{0.1}$O (A = Li, Na, K) were synthesized and their stuctural, microstructural and thermal properties have been discussed. X-ray diffraction combined with thermal cycling confirms that even a medium configurational entropy ($\sim$ 0.95R) can induce single-phase behavior stabilized by configurational entropy ($\Delta S_{conf}$), challenging the traditional threshold of $1.5\,R$. High-resolution TEM and EDS mapping reveal nanocrytalline features and homogeneous elemental distribution respectively, while XPS analysis confirms divalent oxidation states. A strong coupling between high configurational entropy with thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) has been observed. First, a sharp decrease in $\kappa$ with increasing $\Delta S_{conf}$ is seen and then decomposed samples (while cooling) show high $\kappa$, demonstrating the role of $\Delta S_{conf}$ on $\kappa$. Furthermore, Li-doped compositions exhibit improved thermoelectric performance, with a maximum figure of merit ($zT$) of $\sim$0.15 at 1173K\, driven by low thermal conductivity and favorable carrier transport. The results highlight that configurational entropy, even at intermediate values, plays a significant role in stabilizing disordered single-phase oxides and tailoring phonon transport.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Open Systems: Emergence of Exceptional Points in Excitonic Spectra from First Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenlin Zhang, Wei Hu, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems hosting excitons, dissipation mechanisms critically shape the excitonic dynamics, band-structure and topological properties. A microscopic understanding of excitons in such non-Hermitian settings demands a first-principles generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Building on a recently introduced nonequilibrium Green's function formalism compatible with Lindbladian dynamics, we derive a non-Hermitian BSE from diagrammatic perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, and obtain a microscopic excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates dissipation while preserving causality. We apply the formalism to valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to structured photon baths. We uncover a rich landscape of exceptional points in momentum space, forming either discrete sets or continuous manifolds, depending on bath structure. The exceptional points give rise to nonanalytic valley-polarization, unusual polarization pattern in photoluminescence, and nontrivial topological signatures. Our results establish a first-principles framework for predicting and controlling excitonic behavior in open quantum materials, showing how engineered environments can be leveraged to induce and manipulate non-Hermitian and topological properties.</p>

            <h2>Are diffusion models ready for materials discovery in unexplored chemical space?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghyun Kim, Gihyeon Jeon, Seungwoo Hwang, Jiho Lee, Jisu Jung, Seungwu Han, Sungwoo Kang</p>
            <p>While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</p>

            <h2>Deep prior-based denoising for state-of-the-art scientific imaging and metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuichi Yokoyama, Kohei Yamagami, Yuta Sumiya, Hayaru Shouno, Masaichiro Mizumaki</p>
            <p>Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, yet a major gap persists between complex, data-hungry deep learning models and the practical demands of state-of-the-art scientific measurements. To fundamentally bridge this gap, we propose deep prior-based denoising, a robust deep learning model that requires no training data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by removing grid artifacts in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a long-standing and critical data analysis challenge in materials science. Our results demonstrate that deep prior-based denoising yields clearer ARPES images in a fraction of the time required by conventional, experiment-based denoising methods. This ultra-efficient approach to ARPES will enable high-speed, high-resolution three-dimensional band structure mapping in momentum space, thereby dramatically accelerating our understanding of microscopic electronic structures of materials. Beyond ARPES, deep prior-based denoising represents a versatile tool that could become a new standard in any advanced scientific measurement fields where data acquisition is limited.</p>

            <p>We report a family of luminescent alternant diradicals which, at room temperature, support a ground-state spin-triplet, near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields, and optical spin addressability. These diradicals comprise trityl groups meta-linked via pyridyl or phenyl groups, enabling optically bright triplet-to-triplet and singlet-to-singlet transitions. At room temperature, we observe optically detected magnetic resonance in these systems at zero magnetic field and a strong magneto-photoluminescence (10% modulation at 2 mT applied magnetic field). Distinct photoluminescence bands (at 630 nm and 700 nm) show opposite-sign spin-optical responses, arising from spin-selective intersystem crossing between triplet and singlet manifolds. These bright, all-organic diradicals offer a new set of chemically tunable materials for room temperature spin-optical interfaces, paving the way for application as quantum sensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cana Elgvin, Fredrik S. Hage, Khairi F. Elyas, Katja Höflich, Øystein Prytz, Christoph T. Koch, Hannah C. Nerl</p>
            <p>Functional nanomaterials, including 2D materials and their heterostructures are expected to impact fields ranging from catalysis, optoelectronics to nanophotonics. To realize their potential, novel experimental approaches need to be developed to characterize the combined materials and their components. Techniques using fast electrons, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), probe phenomena over an unrivaled energy range with high resolution. In addition, momentum-resolved EELS simultaneously records energy and momentum transfer to the sample and thus generates two-dimensional data sets for each beam position. This allows excitations that occur at large momentum transfer to be resolved, including those outside of the light cone and beyond the first Brillouin zone, all whilst retaining nanometer sized spatial selectivity. Such capabilities are particularly important when probing phonons, plasmons, excitons and their coupling in 2D materials and their heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Self-Consistent Fourier-Tschebyshev Representations of the First Normal Stress Difference in Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas King, Eugene Pashkovski, Reid Patterson, Paige Rockwell, Gareth H. McKinley</p>
            <p>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) is a key technique for characterizing nonlinear viscoelasticity in a wide range of materials. Most research to date has focused on the shear stress response to an oscillatory strain input. However, for highly elastic materials such as polymer melts, the time-varying first normal stress difference $N_1(t;\omega,\gamma_0)$ can become much larger than the shear stress at sufficiently large strains, serving as a sensitive probe of the material's nonlinear characteristics. We present a Fourier-Tschebyshev framework for decomposing the higher-order spectral content of the $N_1$ material functions generated in LAOS. This new decomposition is first illustrated through analysis of the second-order and fourth-order responses of the quasilinear Upper Convected Maxwell model and the fully nonlinear Giesekus model. We then use this new framework to analyze experimental data on a viscoelastic silicone polymer and a thermoplastic polyurethane melt. Furthermore, we couple this decomposition with the recently developed Gaborheometry strain sweep technique to enable rapid and quantitative determination of the $N_1$ material function from experimental normal force data obtained in a single sweep from small to large strain amplitudes. We verify that asymptotic connections between the oscillatory shear stress and $N_1$ in the quasilinear limit are satisfied for the experimental data, ensuring self-consistency. This framework for analyzing the first normal stress difference is complementary to the established framework for analyzing the shear stresses in LAOS, and augments the content of material-specific data sets, hence more fully quantifying the important nonlinear viscoelastic properties of a wide range of soft materials.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the existence of a frequency band exhibiting acoustic transparency in 2D and 3D dense granular suspensions, enabling the transmission of a low-frequency ballistic wave excited by a high-frequency broadband ultrasound pulse. This phenomenon is attributed to spatial correlations in the structural disorder of the medium. To support this interpretation, we use an existing model that incorporates such correlations via the structure factor. Its predictions are shown to agree well with those of the Generalized Coherent Potential Approximation (GCPA) model, which is known to apply at high volume fractions, including the close packing limit, but does not explicitly account for disorder correlation. Within the transparency band, attenuation is found to be dominated by absorption rather than scattering. Measurements of the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient reveal significant deviations from conventional models, challenging the current understanding of acoustic absorption in dense granular media.</p>

            <h2>Toggling stiffness via multistability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Michele Curatolo, Renate Sachse, Edoardo Milana</p>
            <p>Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems in soft robotics and smart structures.</p>

            <h2>Is Platinum a Proton Blocking Catalyst?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aparna Saksena, Yujun Zhao, J. Manoj Prabhakar, Dierk Raabe, Baptiste Gault, Yug Joshi</p>
            <p>Platinum, to date, is the most widely applied electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It is assumed to be a proton-blocking catalyst with only surface-limited adsorption of the reaction intermediates. Here, we critically evaluate the bulk interaction of Pt with hydrogen (H), and its heavier isotope deuterium (D), by monitoring operando mass change of the Pt electrode during galvanostatic heavy/water splitting by employing an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Unexpectedly, we observe an irreversible temporal mass gain and a change in the reaction's overpotential, arising from diffusion of H/D into Pt, confirmed by atom probe tomography and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Sub-surface concentration of at least ca. 15 at. % of D in Pt was observed, diffusing down to a depth of more than 10 nm. Analytical description quantified the diffusion coefficient of D in Pt to be 3.2X10^-18 cm2Xs-1. These findings challenge the existing credence of Pt-proton interaction being limited to the surface, prompting the expansion of the catalyst design strategies to account for property-modifying bulk diffusion of H/D in the Pt matrix</p>

            <h2>Optically induced orbital polarization in bulk germanium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Scali, Marco Finazzi, Federico Bottegoni, Carlo Zucchetti</p>
            <p>Optical orientation has been proven as a powerful tool to inject spin-polarized electron and hole populations in III-V and group-IV semiconductors. In particular, the absorption of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge generates a spin-oriented population of electrons in the conduction band with a spin-polarization up to 50%, whereas the hole spin-polarization, opposite to the electron one, can even reach values up to 83%. In this letter, we theoretically investigate the optical injection of orbital polarization by means of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge and we show that the latter considerably exceeds 100% for holes and photon energies close to the direct Ge gap. These results suggest that Ge is a convenient platform for future development of orbitronics and opto-orbitronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chhatra Bahadur Subba, Bhanu Chettri, Amel Laref, Zeesham Abbas, Amna Parveen, Dibya Prakash Rai, Zaithanzauva Pachuau</p>
            <p>The development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for clean energy conversion remains a central challenge in materials science. Although platinum serves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family monolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic, vibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation functionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band gap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical stability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these findings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the computed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a sustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation UV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral graphene (rG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host flat bands that stabilize various strongly correlated quantum phases, including Mott insulators, integer, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases. In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to visualize the dispersion of flat bands with doping and applied displacement fields in a hBN-aligned rhombohedral trilayer graphene (rtG)/hBN moiré superlattice. In addition to the intrinsic flat bands of rtG induced by the displacement field, we observe low-energy features originating from moiré potential-induced band folding. Real-space variations of the spectroscopic features allow us to quantify the spatial structure of the moiré potential at the rtG/hBN interface. Importantly, we find that accurately capturing the moiré site-dependent spectra requires incorporating a moiré potential acting on the top graphene layer with a sign opposite to that of the bottom layer into the continuum model. Our results thus provide key experimental and theoretical insights into understanding the role of the moire superlattice in rG/hBN heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Behzad Mortezapour, Sebastian Hamer, Rainer Herges, Roberto Robles, Richard Berndt</p>
            <p>We investigated trioxatriangulenium functionalized with phenyl (phenyl-TOTA) on the (111) surfaces of Ag and Au using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). On Ag(111), the molecules form hexagonal arrays, and on Au(111), honeycomb patterns are also observed. The orientations of the phenyl moieties are resolved on both substrates. On Ag(111), the orientations are parallel within a row and they differ by approximately $60^\circ$ between adjacent molecular rows, and STM images suggest dimerization of the molecules. DFT calculations for Ag(111) reveal that van der Waals interactions dominate this system. The optimized structure matches the experimental pattern, and the simulated STM images exhibit apparent dimerization. This dimerization results from an asymmetry of the phenyl wavefunction, which reflects intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the ligand and an oxygen atom within the triangulenium platform. The orientation of the phenyl moieties is explained by the interaction of each phenyl moiety with its triangulenium platform combined with the direct long-range interaction between phenyl moieties across molecules.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor photocatalysis offers a sustainable route for converting solar energy into chemical energy, enabling the production of clean fuels and valuable chemical products. To this aim, we explore van der Waals heterostructures made up of Janus PtSSe and WXY (X, Y $=$ S, Se, Te and X $\neq$Y), in the context of photocatalytic applications. The redox capabilities of various heterostructure configurations (atom facing types and stacking orders) are evaluated by aligning the absolute band edge positions with respect to redox potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. The stability of photocatalyst candidates are checked by layer binding energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The optical absorption spectra suggest good light absorption in the visible range. Further, strain engineering is applied as a way to tune band edges and evaluate the possible use of the heterostructures as photocatalysts. This study shows that van der Waals heterostructure bilayers composed of Janus PtSSe and WSeTe in specific geometric configurations can be potential materials as photocatalysts for HER, OER and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. Finally, we suggest that, although systems made up of PtSSe and WSTe cannot be used for photocatalytic applications, they can be explored for applications in thermoelectric energy conversion or infrared photovoltaics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Lopez, Sébastien Fumeron, Malte Henkel, Trifce Sandev, Esther D. Gutiérrez</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maite Arcos, Philippe Faist, Takahiro Sagawa, Jonathan Oppenheim</p>
            <p>In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Rényi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</p>

            <h2>Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathias Boulanger, Ericmoore Jossou</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilio Rui, Joachim Cohen, Alexandru Petrescu</p>
            <p>We present a nonperturbative tensor-network approach to the excitation spectra of superconducting circuits based on Josephson junction arrays. These arrays provide the large lumped inductances required for qubit designs, yet their intrinsically many-body nature is typically reduced to effective single-mode descriptions. Perturbative treatments attempt to include the collective array modes neglected in these approximations, but a fully nonperturbative analysis is challenging due to the many-body structure and the collective character of these modes. We overcome this difficulty using the DMRG-X algorithm, which extends tensor-network methods to excited states. Our key advance is a construction of trial states from the linearized mode structure, enabling direct computation of excitations, even in degenerate manifolds, which was previously inaccessible. Our results reveal significant deviations from, and allow us to improve upon, previous perturbative treatments in the regime of low array junction impedance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. J. R. Bezerra Jr., W. S. Dias</p>
            <p>We investigate the modulational instability of uniform wave packets governed by a discrete third-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation in finite square lattices, modeling light propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U > 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by applying a tunable imaginary gauge transformation on the platform of the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. From the measured topology of the Riemann surface, we reveal the complex-energy winding, the open-boundary-condition spectrum, the generalized Brillouin zone, and the branch points. Our findings demonstrate a unified framework in the studies of diverse effects in non-Hermitian topological physics through an experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surfaces.</p>

            <p>Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</p>

            <p>The storage of large-scale quantum information at finite temperature requires an autonomous and reliable quantum hard drive, also known as a self-correcting quantum memory. It is a long-standing open problem to find a self-correcting quantum memory in three dimensions. The recently introduced Layer Codes achieve the best possible scaling of code parameters and logical energy barrier in three dimensions, these are tantalizing features for the purposes of self-correction. In this work we show that a family of Layer Codes, based on good Quantum Tanner Codes, exhibit partial self-correction. Their memory time grows exponentially with linear system size, up to a length scale that is exponential in the inverse temperature. At this length scale, the memory time scales as a double exponential of inverse temperature. To establish this result we introduce a concatenated matching decoder that combines three rounds of parallelized minimum-weight perfect-matching with a decoder for good Quantum Tanner Codes. We show that our decoder corrects errors up to a constant fraction of the energy barrier, and a constant fraction of the code distance, for a family of Layer Codes. Our results position Layer Codes as the leading candidate for a partially self-correcting memory in three dimensions. While they fall short of achieving strict self-correction in the thermodynamic limit, our work highlights the potential of these local codes in three dimensions, with fast distance and logical qubit growth, fast decoders, and a long memory time over a wide range of parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</p>

Here, we introduce spatially resolved momentum-space imaging using arrays of 3D-printed microlenses directly integrated onto semiconductor optical microcavities. Each microlens functions as an independent optical element with a high numerical aperture (approx. 0.95), enabling parallel back focal plane imaging across, in our implementation, 64 distinct locations. This approach eliminates the need for bulky microscope objectives while maintaining broad wavevector access, even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate its versatility across various cavity systems, including dielectric planar resonators, GaAs-based polariton microcavities, and CdTe platforms supporting nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons. The microlenses not only enhance collection efficiency but also enable tightly focused excitation, yielding an order of magnitude reduction in condensation thresholds compared with conventional setups.

            <p>Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</p>

This is similar to what was used to locate the complex CFT of the 5-state Potts model in dimension $d=2$ [PRL 133 (2024) 077101]. There it was shown that a CFT is characterized by a stationarity condition for the measured effective central charge. Our strategy is to write the ground-state energy as $E_{\rm GS}(N)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] with good precision, and their sweet spot as well. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajath Radhakrishnan, Adar Sharon, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn</p>
            <p>Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. Miguel Barriuso G., Jose Martin-Roca, Valentino Bianco, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Chantal Valeriani</p>
            <p>We study active agents embedded in bulk or in confinement explicitly considering hydrodynamics and simulating the swimmers via an implementation inspired by the squirmer model. We develop a Dissipative Particle Dynamics scheme for the solvent. This approach allows us to properly deal not only with hydrodynamics but also with thermal fluctuations. On the other side, this approach enables us to study active agents with complex shapes, ranging from spherical colloids to polymers. To start with, we study a simple spherical colloid. We analyze the features of the velocity fields of the surrounding solvent, when the colloid is a pusher, a puller or a neutral swimmer either in bulk or confined in a cylindrical channel. Next, we characterise its dynamical behaviour by computing the mean square displacement and the long time diffusion when the active colloid is in bulk or in a channel (varying its radius) and analyze the orientation autocorrelation function in the latter case. While the three studied squirmer types are characterised by the same bulk diffusion, the cylindrical confinement considerably modulates the diffusion and the orientation autocorrelation function. Finally, we focus our attention on a more complex shape: an active polymer. We first characterise the structural features computing its radius of gyration when in bulk or in cylindrical confinement, and compare to known results obtained without hydrodynamics. Next, we characterise the dynamical behaviour of the active polymer by computing its mean square displacement and the long time diffusion. On the one hand, both diffusion and radius of gyration decrease due to the hydrodynamic interaction when the system is in bulk. On the other hand, the effect of confinement is to decrease the radius of gyration, disturbing the motion of the polymer and thus reducing its diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Terahertz Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingda Zhang, Su Ying Quek</p>
            <p>Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first-principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero-field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high-fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realising a single-photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, highlighting the opportunities for next generation THz quantum technologies - an area of growing interest given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Preethi Gopalakrishnan, Shovan Dutta</p>
            <p>Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits forming a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining over 75000 networks of different families with tunable structural properties, we demonstrate that (i) heterogeneity in the number of neighbors is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) apart from the number of neighbors, the key determinant is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the frustration level. In fact, one can vary the magnetization throughout its range by embedding such hubs. We also discuss simple, exactly solvable networks where such tunability leads to both abrupt and continuous transitions, with quantum effects giving rise to a diverging susceptibility. Our findings can be realized on emerging platforms and pose a number of fundamental questions, strongly motivating wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena on complex networks.</p>

            <h2>Disorder operators in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study the disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asymptotically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of the Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</p>

            <h2>Nonmonotonic temperature behavior of magnetization and related functional properties in ordering Fe-rich Fe-Al alloys</h2>

            <p>The properties of alloys that undergo to chemical order-disorder transformations depend heavily on the degree of ordering in the crystal lattice. In particular, the ordering in a magnetic alloy like Fe-rich (x>0.5) Fe_xAl_1-x, for example, leads typically to reducing its magnetization and even to a transition from the ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) state at x<0.7. Our study was focused on the kinetics of ordering in thin Fe_xAl_1-x films of a nonstoichiometric composition (0.5<x<0.7). We demonstrate that, when the alloy is aged at a sufficiently high temperature, the formation of a chemically ordered structure is accompanied by an increase in magnetization and related functional properties, such as the anomalous Hall (AH) resistivity. We believe that these properties improve owing to the segregation of Fe and its precipitation outside the growing nuclei of the ordered B2-Fe_0.5Al_0.5 phase. The driving force for the Fe segregation we observe is associated with the squeezing out of excess Fe into the surrounding matrix by growing B2 nuclei. Simulations of the B2 nucleation process, performed using the molecular dynamics method, confirm our experimental findings. The results we report contrast to previous studies, which assumed that the growth of the B2 phase in alloys such as Fe_xAl_1-x (0.5<x<0.7) occurred through the mechanism of continuous ordering.</p>

            <h2>Effect of the Lattice-distortion on the Electronic Structure, Magnetic Anisotropy, and Hall Conductivities of the CoFeCrGa Spin Gapless Semiconductor: A First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amar Kumar, Sujeet Chaudhary, Sharat Chandra</p>
            <p>Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs), novel quantum materials, are notable for their tunable spin-transport properties. Considering that the SGS materials might have an invariably deformed lattice upon integration into devices, and given that the SGS nature is highly sensitive to external factors, the impact of lattice distortions on the different physical properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy has been investigated using density functional theory calculations. For lattice distortions, the uniform strain corresponding to $-6\% \leq \Delta V / V_0 \leq 6\% \quad (a: 5.60\text{-}5.83~\textÅ)$, and the tetragonal distortion corresponding to $0.8 \leq c/a \leq 1.2 \quad (a: 5.38\text{-}6.16~\textÅ,~c: 4.92\text{-}6.45~\textÅ)$ are modelled. All uniformly strained CoFeCrGa structures are found to display SGS character, magnetic isotropy, small anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), and small spin Hall conductivity (SHC) - closely resembling those of the ideal CoFeCrGa structure. In contrast, the tetragonally deformed structures display nearly half-metallic behavior with very high spin polarization, very large magnetic anisotropy ($ \sim 10^6~\mathrm{J/m^3}$), and very large AHC ranging from ($ -215 \text{ to } 250~\mathrm{S/cm} $) depending on the axial ratio of the distorted structure. The SHC, however, does not change significantly under tetragonal distortion and remains nearly of the same order as that of the Y-I ordered structure. In summary, these findings demonstrate that CoFeCrGa displays favorable spintronic properties even under lattice distortions, underscoring its potential for next-generation spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Zubeltzu, Fernando Bresme, Matthew Dawber, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Emilio Artacho</p>
            <p>Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarizability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used, understanding the interplay between electronic and ionic contributions becomes critical, contrary to what is widely assumed. This highlights the importance of electronic degrees of freedom in interpreting the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p>We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</p>

            <p>We conjecture that the current fluctuations in one-dimensional driven transport systems obey an upper bound determined by the mean current and the driving force. This inequality originates from repulsive interactions between transporting particles, and the bound is approached both in near-equilibrium systems and in far-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions. We first propose a coarse-grained model describing random particle exchanges between two reservoirs with constant rates, from which the upper bound emerges. We then rigorously prove the inequality in quantum ballistic transport systems. Finally, we demonstrate its validity in two specific diffusive systems: the exclusion process, for which the inequality can be proven, and charged-particle transport, for which numerical evidence supports the inequality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Gabriele, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco, Filomena Forte</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. We also show that HHG is particularly sensitive to dynamical rotational-symmetry breaking, as even high-order components can be modulated by a time-dependent symmetry breaking. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials, and provide novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.</p>

            <p>We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$ index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain broader bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where the quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental bismuth realizing a nontrivial even spin-Chern number. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses and show their robustness in the presence of disorder within a real space marker formulation, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry is observable in realistic experimental settings of impure materials. Finally, we connect spin bounds to quantum Cramér-Rao bounds that are central to quantum metrology, showing that elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation with electron spin qubits requires coherent and efficient manipulation of these spins, typically accomplished through the application of alternating magnetic or electric fields for electron spin resonance (ESR). In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.</p>

            <p>Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fréchet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.</p>

            <p>We present a scenario, in which a gapless extended phase serves as a "hub" connecting multiple symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum critical points. As a concrete example, we construct a lattice model with $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$ symmetry for quantum spin-1/2 degrees of freedom that realizes four distinct gapful phases supporting antiferromagnetic long-range order and one extended incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeshi Mizushima, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the TPT by exploiting the static and dynamical density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses, the density response including the effect of Coulomb interactions, reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</p>

            <p>Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to explicitly evaluate this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. In this paper, we describe the hierarchical autoregressive network (HAN) algorithm in three spatial dimensions and study its performance using the example of the Ising model. We compare HAN with three other autoregressive architectures and the classical Wolff cluster algorithm. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamic observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as entropy and free energy, in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</p>

            <p>The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</p>

The electric polarization for the latter represents a new and distinguishable paradigm in materials science and physics because its electric polarization states embedded in the conduction electron sea are able to couple with (and controlled by) the external electric field. However, the microscopic polarization switching process and mechanism in these 2D vdW metallic materials have not been experimentally observed and remain elusive. Here, we report the first direct experimental imaging of the microscopic mechanism behind electric-field-coupled polarization switching in a metallic system. Our gate-tunable nanoscale optical imaging identifies the robust coexistence of electric polarization and appreciable carrier densities in adjacent polar domains hosting opposite electric polarizations in a 2D elemental metallic material, tetralayer graphene. We directly visualize and verify that the sliding domain wall (DW) solitons confined at the middlemost interface are responsible for the polarization switching in tetralayer graphene upon the application of electric fields and mechanical forces. Our work provides the first direct visualization of domain wall sliding-induced polarization switching in 2D elemental carbon at room temperature, significantly expanding and advancing the research of "ferroelectric metal" initially dubbed by P.

            <h2>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. I. Mukhin</p>
            <p>A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.</p>

Using a microscopic model based on a modified Usadel equation incorporating those effects, we show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the pairing amplitudes can form a texture.</p>

            <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</p>

            <p>In a recent paper (Y. Ma and X. Cui, Phys. Rev.

The proposed structures are made of an outer shell of liquid (1,2) enveloping a spherical core of (2,3) liquid, which is claimed to be stable without the need of any trapping potential. I comment in the following that these structures are not actually the ground-states solutions to the system but rather local energy minima, and most likely impossible to realize in practice.</p>

            <p>Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We confirm the presence of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo M. Yoshitome, Heitor Casasola, Rodrigo Corso, Pedro R. S. Gomes</p>
            <p>We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>We construct dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for several cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. Only allowing for single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, only accounting for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Moreover, combining the different dynamics gives a large number of further models. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Cépas, G. Masbaum, P. Quémerais</p>
            <p>The Aubry transition is a phase transition between two types of incommensurate states, originally described as a transition by ``breaking of analyticity''. Here we present Denjoy's (anachronistic) viewpoint, who almost hundred years ago described certain mathematical properties of circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers. The connection between the two lies in the existence of a change of variables from the incommensurate ground state variables to new simple phase variables that rotate by a constant irrational angle. This confers a cyclic order, an essential property of models with the Aubry transition. Denjoy's description indicates that there are two types of cyclic order, distinguished by the regular or singular nature of the change of variables or, in mathematical terms, by the distinction between topological conjugacy versus semiconjugacy. This allows rephrasing the breaking of analyticity as a breaking of topological conjugacy. We illustrate this description with numerical calculations on the Frenkel-Kontorova model.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Wu, Jia-Ji Zhu, Jian Li, Xue-Min Yang, Jiang-Shan Chen, Mu Zhou</p>
            <p>Dirac semimetals can be classified into types I, II, and III based on the topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system can be sliced into a family of kz-dependent normal and topological insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a 2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator. To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points, one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in a single system. Here, we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals by a special Floquet driving that preserves time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. M. Beltukov, A. V. Rodina, A. Alekseev, Al. L. Efros</p>
            <p>Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. Near such interfaces, a charged particle creates a singular self-interaction potential which may be attributed to interaction with fictitious mirror charges. The singularity of this interaction at the interface presents an obstruction to a perturbative approach. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we have developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with a dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the energy spectrum of quantum wells (QWs) at the interface with the vacuum or a high-k dielectric. For a surface of liquid helium, we estimate the parameter W, and match the resulting electron spectrum with the existing experimental data and theoretical analysis.</p>

            <p>The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KH$_2$PO$_4$ (KDP), we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.</p>

            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun</p>
            <p>Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</p>

            <p>In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile, reconfigurable storage devices. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic flux controlled current phase relationship in double Quantum Dot Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyan Wang, Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.</p>

            <p>We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</p>

            <p>Objective: This work aims to demonstrate a low-power, biomimetic auditory sensing concept for fully implantable cochlear implants. The approach draws inspiration from the frequency selectivity and temporal encoding of the cochlea, and uses neuromorphic spike generation to replace conventional signal processing blocks. The goal is to establish a compact, energy-efficient front-end architecture suitable for future implantable systems. Methods: An auditory sensing unit was implemented, consisting of a piezoelectric MEMS cantilever mechanically coupled to a single VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator. This configuration enables FFT-free, frequency-selective sensing and direct spike generation, forming a biomimetic auditory front end. The concept was experimentally examined using controlled mechanical excitation. Results: The sensing unit exhibited frequency-selective detection of mechanical vibrations in the nanometer to tens-of-nanometers displacement range and generated biomimetic spiking waveforms. Spike rate-encoding of the input amplitude was demonstrated, with output spiking frequencies tunable between approximately 100 Hz and 1 kHz depending on the excitation level. The waveform was finally converted to a biphasic shape suitable for cochlear implant stimulation. Significance: Temporal encoding is fundamental to natural auditory signal processing in the nervous system. By implementing this principle through neuromorphic spike encoding, the proposed approach can provide significant benefits for cochlear implants. In addition, the circuit has the potential to reduce footprint, energy consumption, and latencies compared with current commercial solutions.</p>

            <p>We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.</p>

            <p>We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.</p>

            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>In this paper we show that a Brownian Gibbsian line ensemble whose top curve approximates a parabola must be given by the parabolic Airy line ensemble. More specifically, we prove that if $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} = (\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2, \ldots )$ is a line ensemble satisfying the Brownian Gibbs property, such that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a constant $\mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) > 0$ with $$\mathbb{P} \Big[ \big| \mathcal{L}_1 (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2 \big| \le \varepsilon t^2 + \mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) \Big] \ge 1 - \varepsilon, \qquad \text{for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$},$$ then $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}$ is the parabolic Airy line ensemble, up to an independent affine shift. Specializing this result to the case when $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2$ is translation-invariant confirms a prediction of Okounkov and Sheffield from 2006 and Corwin-Hammond from 2014.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongliang Wang</p>
            <p>We derive the general circuit equations and system models directly from four Maxwell's equations and develop the electric-charge-based and magnetic-flux-based analysis methodologies to unify the analyses for both phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, and phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. We invent the electric-charge-flow (ECF) diagram and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagram to abstract electric circuits into electric-charge-pump (ECP) networks and magnetic-flux-pump (MFP) networks, and visualize the dynamics of charge and flux distributions in electric circuits. The ECF and MFF diagrams are the graphic expressions of the system models of electric circuits, which can be directly simulated through solving general circuit equations. They are novel graphic languages for electromagnetic field-based circuit design and analysis.</p>

            <p>Signals of entanglement and nonlocality are quantitatively evaluated at zero and finite temperature in an analogue black hole realized in the flow of a quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The violation of Lorentz invariance inherent to this analog system opens the prospect to observe 3-mode quantum correlations and we study the corresponding violation of bipartite and tripartite Bell inequalities. It is shown that the long wavelength modes of the system are maximally entangled, in the sense that they realize a superposition of continuous variable versions of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states whose entanglement resists partial tracing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Juričić, Olivera Miskovic, Francisca Ramírez Carrasco</p>
            <p>We study torsional topological defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in ($4+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the holographic interpretation, these correspond to crystalline dislocation defects associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling is fixed at the Chern-Simons point. By solving the equations of motion through an asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that the dual ($3+1$)-dimensional theory admits axially symmetric solutions. These solutions describe holographic materials with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded by a black hole in the bulk. At the same time, they feature ring-shaped defects arising from the background Riemann-Cartan geometry, characterized by nontrivial Burgers vectors. We also discuss the possible appearance of an odd-parity Abelian holographic anomaly, proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results motivate further studies of holographic defects using bulk gravitational theories and support the view that torsion provides a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Milekhin, Sara Murciano</p>
            <p>Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</p>

            <h2>Filtering out mislabeled training instances using black-box optimization and quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Asker, Mohamed Swailem, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia</p>
            <p>Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</p>

            <h2>Discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free discrete time crystals (DTCs) in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time first grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and is then saturated, which depends on the energy density of the initial state. Since thermalization of the effective Hamiltonian is slow, there is no typical prethermalization and PDTCs in the Floquet system before final thermalization. The robustness of DTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order</p>

            <p>We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the two-dimensional square-lattice $XX$ model [T.I.

Using the infinite projected entangled pair state, we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions. This finding contradicts the quantum simulation data where the correlation length seems to obey KZ-like power laws, although with modified exponents.</p>

            <h2>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David E. Evans, Corey Jones</p>
            <p>We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst</p>
            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</p>

One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p>Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</p>

We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values.

            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p>Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93 and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties. Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for predictive modeling of diverse material properties.</p>

            <p>While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</p>

            <h2>Measuring intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors using nonlinear response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-En Tseng, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>We discuss intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors, and how they may be measured using non-linear optical (terahertz) response. We consider both $s$ and $d$-wave superconductors, both with and without a phenomenological (energy dependent) damping. Intrinsic relaxation rates of interest include the Higgs mode decay rate, the quasiparticle redistribution rate ($1/T_1$) and the quasiparticle dephasing rate ($1/T_2$), where the latter two rates are zero in the pure BCS model, but non-zero in the presence of damping. Using the Anderson pseudospin formalism, we illustrate how these intrinsic relaxation rates are related to measurable quantities such as the time-dependent gap function and the non-linear current (a.k.a. third harmonic generation). Hence, we show how intrinsic relaxation rates may be experimentally extracted and discuss what one may thereby learn about the underlying damping. We also discuss the effects of polarization control (viz. non-linear response to light polarized in different directions), which offers a useful experimental knob, especially for $d$-wave superconductors, enabling selective excitation of modes in different irreducible representations (and readout of their corresponding relaxation rates).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Daniel Torres Luna, Sebastian Miles, A. Mert Bozkurt, Chun-Xiao Liu, Antonio L. R. Manesco, Anton R. Akhmerov, Michael Wimmer</p>
            <p>To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit, requires careful optimization of competing quality metrics. We systematically compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models, creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and disorder are limiting factors.</p>

Josephson coupling of the weak links and electron density in the plaquettes are independently controlled by separate electrostatic gates. Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with experiment.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.</p>

Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</p>

            <p>We systematically study the efficiency of the intrinsic superconducting diode effect of several pair-density-wave states that can emerge in two-dimensional $d$-wave metallic altermagnets. To this end, we investigate several scenarios using an effective minimal microscopic model and Ginzburg-Landau analysis in order to derive the corresponding pairing phase diagrams. In addition, we examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems. As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar interactions. In this paper, we examine how a nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section affects spin-wave propagation along its long axis when a bias magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the axis. Employing micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhruv C. Desai, Lauren A. Tan, Jin-Jian Zhou, Shiyu Peng, Jinsoo Park, Marco Bernardi</p>
            <p>Topological effects arising from the Berry curvature lead to intriguing transport signatures in quantum materials. Two such phenomena are the chiral anomaly and nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). A unified description of these transport regimes requires a quantitative treatment of both band topology and electron scattering. Here, we show accurate predictions of the magnetoresistance in topological semimetals and NLHE in noncentrosymmetric materials by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon ($e$-ph) scattering and Berry curvature computed from first principles. We apply our method to study magnetotransport in a prototypical Weyl semimetal, TaAs, and the NLHE in strained monolayer WSe$_2$, bilayer WTe$_2$ and bulk BaMnSb$_2$. In TaAs, we find a chiral contribution to the magnetoconductance which is positive and increases with magnetic field, consistent with experiments. We show that $e$-ph interactions can significantly modify the Berry curvature dipole and its dependence on temperature and Fermi level, highlighting the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions in nonlinear transport. The computed nonlinear Hall response in BaMnSb$_2$ is in agreement with experiments. By adding the Berry curvature to first-principles transport calculations, our work advances the quantitative analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear transport phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>In this work, we reveal a curious type of moiré effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moiré replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moiré period in the range of 25 Å to 80 Å by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moiré periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moiré modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moiré effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Zhang, Guoying Gao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Han Yang, Ji-Yao Chen, Xiao-Yu Dong</p>
            <p>Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Yu, Junrong Wang, Huajin Zhao, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and super-Poissonian ($F > 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.</p>

            <p>We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.</p>

            <p>Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly this http URL and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the Néel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3°. This is observed as the corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior, attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging across the moiré supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of antiferromagnetic order.</p>

            <p>The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.</p>

            <p>Origami-inspired self-deployable structures offer lightweight, compact, and autonomous deployment capabilities, making them highly attractive for aerospace and defence applications, such as solar panels, antennas, and reflector systems. This paper presents finite element frameworks for simulating Miura-origami units in ABAQUS, focusing on two deployment mechanisms: elastic strain energy release and thermally activated shape-memory polymers (SMPs). Validation against experimental data for elastic deployment demonstrates that the model accurately captures fold trajectories and overall kinematics. Parametric studies reveal the influence of hinge stiffness and damping on deployment efficiency.

            <p>Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic. Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by Mølmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schrödinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</p>

            <h2>Far-field radiation of bulk, edge and corner eigenmodes from a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger plasmonic lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Buendía, José Luis Pura, Vincenzo Giannini, José Antonio Sánchez Gil</p>
            <p>Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis, employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode. Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.</p>

            <h2>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</h2>

            <p>Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (<10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</p>

            <p>NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable platform for superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Imran, Sikander Azam, Qaiser Rafiq, Amin Ur Rahman</p>
            <p>Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1 eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2 eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K. These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Sardinero, Jorge Cayao, Rubén Seoane Souto, Pablo Burset</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled, which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Philippe Ghosez</p>
            <p>Magnetic spin topological textures recently found their electrical counterparts in polar topologies emerging from the condensation of inhomogeneous polar atomic distortions. Here, we further extend the concept to other non-polar atomic degrees of freedom. Taking SrTiO$_3$ as a prototypical example, we investigate from second-principles atomistic simulations, the equilibrium domain structures and topological textures associated with the natural antiferrodistortive rotations of its oxygen octahedra. % Besides the common 90$^\circ$ antiferrodistortive domain walls (twin boundaries), we identify new metastable 180$^\circ$ domain walls oriented along the $\lbrace100\rbrace_\mathrm{pc}$ direction, when compressive epitaxial strain is applied. These domains exhibit complex antiferrodistortive Bloch- and Néel-like configurations with the later being the most favorable. We also stabilize antiferrodistortive vortex and antivortex structures which are accompanied by co-localized polarization vortices and a complex pattern of the local strain field, giving rise to a trimodal topological structures. Our results extends the concept of topological ordering to non-polar structural degrees of freedom and highlights the role of lattice-mediated couplings in stabilizing complex textures in perovskite oxides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cui-Qun Chen, Wenyuan Qiu, Zhihui Luo, Meng Wang, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ artificial superlattices recently emerged as a prototypical platform for the emergence and study of polar topologies. While previous studies mainly focused on the polar textures inherent to the ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ layers, the oxygen octahedra rotations inherent to the paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ layers have attracted much little attention. Here, we highlight a biunivocal relationship between distinct polar topologies -- including $a_1/a_2$ domains, polar vortices, and skyrmions -- within the PbTiO$_3$ layers and specific patterns of oxygen octahedra rotations in the SrTiO$_3$ layers. This relationship arises from a strain-mediated coupling between the two materials and is shown to be reciprocal. Through second-principles atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that each polar texture imposes a corresponding rotation pattern, while conversely, a frozen oxygen octahedra rotation dictates the emergence of the associated polar state. This confirms the strong coupling between oxygen octahedra rotations in SrTiO$_3$ and polarization in PbTiO$_3$, highlighting their cooperative role in stabilizing complex polar textures in related superlattices.</p>

            <p>The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit, a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for electrically tunable spintronics.</p>

            <p>Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</p>

It is shown that, in qualitative agreement with the results of the mean field, the heat bath algorithm leads to a significant decrease in the estimate of critical temperatures due to more complete accounting of fluctuations, and also makes it possible to detect phase inhomogeneous states.

            <h2>The Phase Diagram for Percolating Free Surfaces in Disordered Assemblies of Faceted Grains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. J. Priour Jr</p>
            <p>Percolation in systems made up of randomly placed impermeable grains is often examined in the context of system spanning clusters of connected solids forming above a relatively low critical grain density $\rho_{c1}$ or networks of interstitial void volumes ceasing to exist above a signficantly higher threshold $\rho_{c2}$. In this work, we interpret these percolation transitions as, respectively, the low and high density boundaries of percolating exposed surfaces which either ensheath clusters of impermeable particles or line tunnel-like voids. Moreover, we find in the thermodynamic limit exposed surfaces are either sheaths or tunnels with a second order phase transition from the former to the latter at a density threshold $\rho_{c*}$ intermediate between $\rho_{c1}$ and $\rho_{c2}$. We calculate critical inclusion densities with a new method which identifies exposed free surfaces in a geometrically exact manner with a computational cost scaling only linearly in the system volume. We obtain $\rho_{c1}$, $\rho_{c2}$, and $\rho_{c*}$ for a variety of grain geometries, including each of the Platonic solids, truncated icosahedra, and structurally disordered inclusions formed from cubes subject to a random sequence of slicing planes. In the case of the latter, we find a limiting value of $5\%$ for the critical porosity at the void percolation threshold as the number of sustained slices per cube becomes large.</p>

The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium process.</p>

Such a model is a reasonable starting point for describing the behavior of polymers such as microtubules in gliding assay experiments. We derive sixth-order nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the intrinsic properties of the filament, namely, its curvature and metric, and show that these equations are capable of supporting multiple different stationary solutions in a co-moving frame, i.e. that chiral active elastic filaments exhibit dynamic multi-stability in their shapes. A linear stability analysis of these solutions is carried out to determine which solutions are stable and a brief analysis of the time-dependent approach to stationary shape is considered. Finally, simulations are presented which confirm many of our predictions while also revealing additional complexity.</p>

            <p>Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.</p>

            <p>Excitons govern the light-matter interaction in 2D gapped materials with intrinsically large binding energies. In spite of plentiful optical measurements in the visible for semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, we still lack optical-absorption studies of the exciton structure of insulating 2D materials that requires UV light. Moreover, measurements of the momentum dispersion of excitons in the vicinity of optical limit are rare owing to low resolutions but hold the key to reveal quasiparticle interactions. To close this gap, we employ high momentum resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ($q$-EELS) to explore exciton dispersions of mono- and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Surprisingly, we reveal a fine structure of the first bright exciton dispersion band composed by two features (A and A$'$), visible only at small momentum, not predicted by Bethe-Salpeter calculations. Introducing an optical conductivity approximation (OCA), we extract from the experimental $q$-EELS spectra the ultraviolet (UV) optical conductivity at zero momentum, $\sigma(\omega)$, and discuss the exciton fine structure in $\sigma(\omega)$, consistent with previous photoluminescence observations. Our findings establish a general methodology to probe the fine structure of exciton dispersions, providing new insights into exciton-phonon sidebands and eventually polarons in low-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85°C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.</p>

            <p>The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</p>

            <h2>Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Wang, Ruihua Fan, Tianle Wang, Samuel J. Garratt, Ehud Altman</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</p>

            <p>We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</p>

            <h2>Classical to Quantum Diffusive Transport in Atomically Thin Semiconductors Capped with High-k Dielectric</h2>

            <p>The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2 modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.</p>

            <h2>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee</p>
            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p>From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Palkanoglou, Alexandros Gezerlis</p>
            <p>The gap equations lie at the core of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, a standard tool in the description of superfluidity. As a set of non-linear integral equations, the gap equations' inherent difficulties oftentimes hinder even the crudest descriptions of superfluid states. Hard-core potentials, high-density superfluids, and coupled-channel pairing are all reasons that have historically required one to provide special treatment to the gap equations to get a solution. In this paper we present a new method for solving the gap equations that holds the promise of being an efficient universal solver that requires the minimum amount of \textit{a priori} knowledge of the targeted solutions. With theoretical evidence of exotic nuclear superfluidity posing new questions to our understanding of this fundamental property of nuclear systems, the presented method can be a valuable tool when exploring new pairing states, finite-temperature properties, or the development of sophisticated descriptions of nuclear superfludity.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer Rényi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grace M. Sommers, J. Alexander Jacoby, Zack Weinstein, David A. Huse, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</p>

            <p>Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G<0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.</p>

            <p>In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\Gamma K$ \& $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anjun Chu, Mikhail Mamaev, Martin Koppenhöfer, Ming Yuan, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zicheng Yan (1), Jialiang Tao (2), Christian Franck (2), David L. Henann (1) ((1) Brown University, (2) University of Wisconsin-Madison)</p>
            <p>This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.</p>

            <p>Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</p>

            <p>We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.</p>

We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <p>Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.</p>

As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</p>

            <p>Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Liang Mao, Hsin-Yuan Huang, Fernando Brandao</p>
            <p>The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Random unitaries that conserve energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Mao, Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Kazi, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</p>

            <h2>Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Zlokapa, Bobak T. Kiani, Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Probe Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sitan Chen, Jordan Cotler, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.</p>

            <h2>Hardness of recognizing phases of matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Schuster, Dominik Kufel, Norman Y. Yao, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</p>

            <h2>Quenching, Fast and Slow: Breaking Kibble-Zurek Universal Scaling by Jumping along Geodesics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thi Ha Kyaw, Guillermo Romero, Gaurav Saxena</p>
            <p>A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>A Structural Theory of Quantum Metastability: Markov Properties and Area Laws</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Bergamaschi, Chi-Fang Chen, Umesh Vazirani</p>
            <p>Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear response functions and disorder: the case of photogalvanic effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Ladovrechis, Tobias Meng</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drude-like features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning. We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.</p>

            <p>Inertial particles (IPs) in vortical fluid flow cluster strongly, forming singular structures termed caustics for their resemblance to focal surfaces in optics. Here we show that such extreme aggregation onto low-dimensional submanifolds can arise without mechanical inertia for self-propelled particles (SPPs), through a formal correspondence between the dynamics of IPs and SPPs in a generic background flow. We establish that a singular perturbation underlies caustics formation by SPPs around a single vortex, and numerical studies of SPPs in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence reveal intense caustics in straining regions of the flow, peaking at intermediate levels of self-propulsion. Our work offers a route to singularly high local concentrations in a macroscopically dilute suspension of zero-Reynolds-number swimmers. Caustics generate burst-like encounters through large relative velocities between neighboring swimmers, with potentially significant implications for communication and sexual reproduction. An intriguing open direction is whether the active turbulence of a suspension of swimming microbes could serve to generate caustics in its own concentration</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Evelyn Tang</p>
            <p>Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</p>

            <h2>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov</p>
            <p>Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</p>

            <p>In amorphous solids, the vibrational density of states shows an excess of modes over the Debye model, known as the boson peak, whose origin remains unclear. Studies suggest a link to quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations or 'defects,' but identifying them is challenging due to hybridization with phonons that renders methods based on localization properties, such as the participation ratio, unreliable. We introduce a practical method to separate hybridized phonons from localized vibrations and find that boson peak phonons hybridize with compact, two-dimensional defects exhibiting oscillatory pure shear deformations. These two-dimensional defects are also exposed by the procedure recently employed to identify stringlets (Nature Physics volume 18, pages 669-677 (2022)), suggesting that these may not be one-dimensional objects as speculated. Our work demonstrates the presence of localized defects at the boson peak frequency and provides a comprehensive characterization of their vibrational and geometric properties, resolving the tension between the concepts of quasi-localized quadrupolar defects and stringlets.</p>

            <p>Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</p>

Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of spin-gap and strange-metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of over-doped regions of SC dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of SC dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement-confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we are able to give a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving the sought-after mechanism responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates.</p>

The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the Néel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</p>

For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</p>

            <p>The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and superconducting properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states.

            <p>Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.</p>

            <h2>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enderalp Yakaboylu, Thomas L. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.</p>

            <p>The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongxin Yu, Shuozhen Zhao, Michael J. Miksis, Petia M. Vlahovska</p>
            <p>The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking into account the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Kang, Oskar Vafek</p>
            <p>Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</p>

            <p>Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques.

The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dana O. Byrne, Stephanie M. Ribet, Karen C. Bustillo, Colin Ophus, Frances I. Allen</p>
            <p>Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (<20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</p>

            <p>The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueyi Wang, Kristjan Haule</p>
            <p>We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the symmetry breaking of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the Néel transition, we accurately predict the Néel temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization and antiferromagnetic susceptibility, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p>Discovery of new states of matter is a key objective in modern condensed matter physics, which often leads to revolutionary technological advancements such as superconductivity. Quantum spin nematic, a ``hidden order'' that evades conventional magnetic probes, is one such state. Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ is a potential spin nematic material, suggested by the observation of a two-magnon Bose-Einstein condensation from above the saturation field. However, direct confirmation of the spin nematicity remains elusive. This Letter presents inelastic neutron scattering spectra from the putative spin nematic phases of Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$, revealing low-energy quadrupole waves that are absent in the neighboring conventional magnetic phases. A spin-one model quantitatively captures the full details of the spin excitation spectra across all low-temperature phases, providing direct evidence of the spin nematic orders. Additionally, we show evidence of the three-magnon continuum and two-magnon bound states in the $1/3$-magnetization plateau, revealing condensation of the two-magnon bound state as the origin of the low-field spin nematic supersolid phase.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency shot noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p>

            <p>We report universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules that solely depend on the strengths of long-range dipolar interaction and microwave coupling. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models, which well reproduce the tetratomic bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find much deeper bound state than the tetratomic one, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality as facilitated by the effective 1D scattering with a large repulsive core from angular fluctuations. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic molecules.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</p>

Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to future cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</p>

            <h2>Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Reactive metals generally undergo hydrogen evolution rather than forming direct hydrides when reacting with acids. However, an alternative pathway that involves the direct insertion of atomic hydrogen into the metal lattice, analogous to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), can induce extreme localized stresses on the order of gigapascals (GPa). This mechanochemical process significantly promotes the formation of metal hydrides under high-stress conditions. Inspired by this mechanism, we synthesized at least 19 high-purity metal hydrides, including MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, CeH2, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, ZrH1.6, ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH, using bulk metal foils and sulfuric or oleic acid as hydrogen sources. Through high-pressure technique conducted at the GPa level using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), we introduce the pressure concepts Delta-Ph and Delta-Peq to elucidate the synthesis and stabilization mechanisms. Quantitative analysis across all 19 hydrides reveals that the criterion abs(Delta-Peq) greater than Delta-Pph is essential for successful acid-mediated hydride formation; conversely, when abs(Delta-Peq) less than Delta-Pph, hydrogen-induced brittle fracture occurs. This principle not only enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH, but also explains failure mechanisms in metals like Fe. Ultimately, this work repurposes HE from a failure mechanism into a controlled tool for hydride synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</p>

In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.</p>

            <h2>Rabi-induced localization and resonant delocalization of a binary condensate in a spin-asymmetric quasiperiodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swarup K. Sarkar, Sh. Mardonov, E. Ya. Sherman, Pankaj K. Mishra</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Putilov, D. V. Zakharov, A. Kudlis, A. S. Mel'nikov, A. I. Buzdin</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect can affect the structure, interactions and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex-antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.</p>

            <p>In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their unique electronic properties. We report upon the growth and electrical transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films is found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state with high mobility electrons. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. For the thinnest 5 nm film, a hole-like state emerges, presumably as the electron-like state is gapped out. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties, and our ability to tune them.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic bounds and symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahiro Futami</p>
            <p>By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Timsina, Andres Chappa, Deema Alyones, Boris Kiefer, Ludi Miao</p>
            <p>We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucien Jezequel, Jens H. Bardarson, Adolfo G. Grushin</p>
            <p>Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant. However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.</p>

When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.</p>

            <p>Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of crystal phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only but not experimentally verified. Here we demonstrate a previously unreported crystal phase of CrS2, namely the distorted octahedral (1T$'$) structure, synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ or 1T phase CrS2. The structure were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as well as scanning electron diffraction (4D-STEM). 4D-STEM reveals that 1T$'$ crystals grow from an originally nucleated kinetically favoured 1T phase which then transform into the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase. Magneto-optic Kerr imaging reveals that the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature. Our MOCVD growth of complex phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.</p>

            <p>We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</p>

            <p>Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of low-density electronic states in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Derivative photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) is employed to estimate the density of states (DOS) of in-gap states. However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. We revealed that PYS signals originate from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of anions, and the biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusion. Because BEE signals mask the DOS contribution, derivative PYS misestimates the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) reliably determines the DOS by separating these components. For a tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) film, CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap and SOMO states over six orders of magnitude, clarifying why the Alq3 layer works effectively in organic light-emitting diodes. In the devices, BEE can act as carrier-generation and degradation processes, and CFS-YS can also probe it. We provide the practical guidelines of low-energy photon measurements for DOS determination, such as measurements of photon-flux dependency.</p>

            <h2>Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p>

            <p>Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</p>

            <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.</p>

Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.</p>

            <p>A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two probability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent density function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models, stochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schrödinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.</p>

            <p>Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.</p>

            <p>We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer Rényi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</p>

To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls</p>
            <p>We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar W. Kennedy, Kevin G. Crawford, Kowsar Shahbazi, Connor D. Shelly</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</p>

            <h2>Gauging the complex SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziruo Zhang, Cheng Peng</p>
            <p>Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</p>

            <p>3D structure modeling is essential across scales, enabling applications from fluid simulation and 3D reconstruction to protein folding and molecular docking. Yet, despite shared 3D spatial patterns, current approaches remain fragmented, with models narrowly specialized for specific domains and unable to generalize across tasks or scales. We propose Uni-3DAR, a unified autoregressive framework for cross-scale 3D generation and understanding. At its core is a coarse-to-fine tokenizer based on octree data structures, which compresses diverse 3D structures into compact 1D token sequences. We further propose a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. To address the challenge of dynamically varying token positions introduced by compression, we introduce a masked next-token prediction strategy that ensures accurate positional modeling, significantly boosting model performance. Extensive experiments across multiple 3D generation and understanding tasks, including small molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals, and macroscopic 3D objects, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster.</p>

            <h2>Liouvillian Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying</p>
            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lluís Torres-Hugas, Jordi Duch, Sergio Gómez</p>
            <p>Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Mousa, Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu</p>
            <p>We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliška Postavová, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <h2>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the asymmetric thermalization of open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Tejero</p>
            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent, allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the proximate insulating state.</p>

            <p>We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>While the superconducting transition temperature of hole-doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} decreases past optimal doping, superconductivity does not completely disappear even for the fully doped KFe_{2}As_{2} compound. In fact, superconductivity is robust through a Lifshitz transition where electron bands become hole-like around the zone corner at around x=0.7, thus challenging the conventional understanding of superconductivity in iron-based systems. High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the superconducting gap structure, as well as the normal state electronic structure, around optimal doping and across the Lifshitz transition. Our findings reveal a largely orbital-dependent superconducting gap structure, where the more strongly correlated d_{xy} band has a vanishing superconducting gap at higher doping, aligning with the Hund's metal behavior observed in the normal state. Notably, the superconducting gap on the d_{xy} band disappears before the Lifshitz transition, suggesting that the Fermi surface topology may play a secondary role. We discuss how these results point to orbital-selective superconducting pairing and how strong correlations via Hund's coupling may shape superconducting gap structures in iron-based and other multiorbital superconductors.</p>

We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between two quantized excitations in a cavity has the potential to lead to hybridized states that bestow novel quantum phenomena as required for emerging applications. In particular, tunable hybrid magnon-phonon cavities with precise control knobs are in pressing demand for developing quantum functionalities in solid-state platforms. Here, using a combination of synthesis and characterization tools, we present an epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) heterostructure that manifests strong couplings between the Kittel magnon and the transverse acoustic phonon. Remarkably, leveraging the magnetoelastic interaction at the epitaxial interface, we demonstrate that when the STO substrate undergoes a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at ~105 K, the Kittel magnon of the LSMO thin film splits into three bands due to anisotropic structural strains along the [100], [010], and [001] crystalline axes, hence, resulting in an array of non-degenerate, hybridized magnon-phonon modes. Moreover, we develop an analytical model that can reproduce the interfacial strain-induced magnon splitting and the strength of magnon-phonon coupling. Our work highlights structural phase transitions as a sensitive trigger for generating multistate magnon-phonon hybridization in high-quality magnetoelastic oxide heterostructures - a new route for implementing strain-mediated hybrid magnonics in phononic systems with potential applications in coherent energy and signal transduction.</p>

By decomposing each Bloch exciton wavefunction into products of single-particle electron and hole maximally localized Wannier functions, this real-space approach provides well-defined orbital- and spatial- resolved measures of both Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons at low computational cost. We apply WFDX to excitons in acene crystals, quantifying how the number of rings, the exciton spin state, and the center-of-mass momntum affect spatial localization. Additionally, we show how this real-space representation reflects structural nonsymmorphic symmetries that are hidden in standard reciprocal-space descriptions. We demonstrate how the WFDX framework can be used to efficiently interpolate exciton expansion coefficients in reciprocal-space and outline how it may facilitate evaluation of observables involving position operators, highlighting its potential as a general tool for both analyzing and computing excitonic properties in solids.</p>

Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems, such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator, photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits.

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials feature a unique anisotropic band structure characterized by quadratic dispersion along one spatial direction and linear dispersion along the other, effectively hybridizing ordinary and Dirac fermions. The anisotropy of energy dispersion can be further modulated through band tilting along either spatial direction of the wave vector. We propose a new definition of tilt parameter to characterize Lifshitz phases in 2D semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratically dispersing direction. Using linear response theory, we theoretically investigate the interband optical conductivity of 2D tilted semi-Dirac bands. Our analytical zero-temperature results reveal pronounced distinctions from Dirac and semi-Dirac systems tilting along the linearly dispersing direction. Notably, we find that spectral fixed point emerges in the optical conductivity over a specific range of the tilt parameter, a phenomenon explained by the corresponding behavior of the joint density of states. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for identifying and characterizing 2D tilted semi-Dirac materials and establish clear spectral fingerprints that distinguish different kinds of 2D semi-Dirac bands and Dirac bands. Our predictions can guide future experimental studies of anisotropic band engineering and tilt-dependent phenomena.</p>

We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. C. Diamantini, C. A. Trugenberger, V. M. Vinokur</p>
            <p>The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle Description of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for SrCuO2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitar Pashov, Casey Eichstaedt, Swagata Acharya, Mark van Schilfgaarde</p>
            <p>SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions. Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom. This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2 with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4 plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.</p>

            <h2>Quartic level repulsion in a quantum chaotic three-body system without symplectic symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex D. Kerin, Barbara Dietz, Joachim Brand</p>
            <p>Among the fundamental symmetry classes of quantum chaotic systems in Dyson's threefold way, the symplectic class is rarely observed in nature. Characterized by the strongest possible level repulsion in the energy spectrum, the symplectic symmetry class also implies a double (Kramers) degeneracy of levels. Studying the spectral statistics of three quantum particles (identical bosons or mass-imbalanced fermions) in a harmonic trap, we find numerical evidence for strong level repulsion in the regime of weak contact interactions. While the statistical indicators are consistent with quantum chaos in systems with symplectic symmetry, the absence of Kramers degeneracy rules out this symmetry. In the strongly-interacting unitary limit either Poissonian or stick statistics are observed (depending on commensurability of the mass ratio) indicating regular dynamics.</p>

            <p>Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic systems.</p>

            <p>It is an ongoing quest to realize topologically ordered quantum states on different platforms including condensed matter systems, quantum simulators and digital quantum processors. Unlike conventional states characterized by their local order, these exotic states are characterized by their non-local entanglement. The consequences of topological order can be as profound as they are surprising, ranging from the emergence of fractionalized anyonic excitations to potentially providing a scalable platform for quantum error correction. This deep connection to quantum computing naturally motivates the realization and study of topologically ordered quantum states on quantum processors. However, due to the non-local nature of these states, their study presents a challenge for near-term quantum devices. This Perspective aims to review the recent progress towards the experimental realization of topologically ordered quantum states, their potential applications, and promising directions of future research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward McCann</p>
            <p>By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <p>The design of strain-stable, or even strain-enhanced thermal transport materials is critical for stable operation of high-performance electronic devices. However, most nanomaterials suffer from strain-induced degradation, with even minor tensile strains markedly reducing thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that screw-dislocated graphites (SDGs), recently identified as topological semimetals, display an unusual increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity under both tensile and compressive strains, revealed by high-accuracy machine-learning-potential-driven non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. Notably, SDGs exhibit over 100% enhancement under tensile strains up to 80% along the dislocation axis, arising from strain-induced increase in dislocation interface tilt angle that elongates the effective heat transfer paths. Their thermal conductivity surpasses multilayer graphene by an order of magnitude. An analytical model is further derived linking thermal conductivity to dislocation number and strain, offering a predictive framework for designing strain-tunable screwdislocated structures. These findings highlight SDGs as a promising platform for high-performance electronic and wearable devices with tunable thermal properties.</p>

            <p>In complex oxides, charge carriers often couple strongly with lattice vibrations to form polarons-entangled electron-phonon quasiparticles whose transport properties remain difficult to characterize. Experimental access to intrinsic polaronic transport requires ultraclean samples, while theoretical descriptions demand methods beyond low-order perturbation theory. Here, we combine the growth of high-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO2 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with a first-principles electron-phonon diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework recently developed for accurate polaron predictions. Our films exhibit record-high electron mobility for anatase TiO2, in excellent agreement with FEP-DMC calculations conducted prior to experiment, which predict a room-temperature mobility of 45 +/- 15 cm2V-1s-1 and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to T^(-1.9 +/- 0.077). Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures. FEP-DMC further provides quantitative insight into polaron formation energy, phonon cloud distribution, lattice distortion around the polaron, and the polaronic contribution to mobility. Together, these results establish a predictive theory-experiment workflow to characterize polarons and provide a microscopic understanding of large-polaron transport in anatase TiO2, with broader implications for complex oxides and other polaronic materials.</p>

            <h2>Data as Commodity: a Game-Theoretic Principle for Information Pricing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Casaburi, Giovanni Piccioli, Pierpaolo Vivo</p>
            <p>Data is the central commodity of the digital economy. Unlike physical goods, it is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous licensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call for new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the value of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players betting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information about past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their informational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed competitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we determine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and seller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from textbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or jointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data they hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while still improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not necessarily reduce profit. Moreover, rivalry between well-informed players can paradoxically benefit uninformed ones, demonstrating that information abundance does not always translate to higher payoffs. We also show that the number of players influences the competition between informed parties: trades impossible in small markets become feasible in larger ones. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the pricing of intangible goods in dynamically interacting digital markets, which are in need of robust valuation principles.</p>

            <h2>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal</p>
            <p>We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</p>

            <h2>Electrical and thermal magnetotransport and the Wiedemann-Franz law in semimetals with electron-electron scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keigo Takahashi, Hiroyasu Matsuura, Hideaki Maebashi, Masao Ogata</p>
            <p>We study the electrical and thermal transport properties and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law of two-carrier semimetals using exact treatments of the Boltzmann equation with the impurity and electron-electron scatterings in a magnetic field. For comparison, we also study those in the case of Baber scattering: a single-carrier system with an impurity scattering and phenomenological momentum-dissipative electron-electron scattering. In both systems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\text{H}} = L_{0}= \pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the Hall Lorenz ratio $L_{\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\mu\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ divided by temperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios deviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a magnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient to their thermal counterparts. The WF laws for them, $\widetilde{L} = \widetilde{L}_{\text{H}} = L_{0}$, and their violation are helpful for the discussion of $L$ and $L_{\text{H}}$. For Baber scattering, our exact result shows $L_{\text{H}}/L_{0} \sim (L/L_{0})^2$ in a weak magnetic field. In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting the different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal resistivities in a magnetic field. This is because the momentum conservation of the electron-electron scattering has a completely different effect on electrical and thermal magnetotransport. We sort out these behaviors using $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$. We also provide a relaxation time approximation, which is useful for comparing theory and experiment.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a mean-field Ising model whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a linear feedback function. A key feature of this linear feedback Ising model (FIM) is the possibility of temperature-induced bistability, where a temperature increase can favor bistability between two phases. We show that the linear FIM provides a minimal model for a transcritical bifurcation as the temperature varies. Moreover, there can be two or three critical temperatures when the external magnetic field is non-negative. In the bistable region, we identify a Maxwell temperature where the two phases are equally probable, and we find that increasing the temperature favors the lower phase. We show that the probability distribution becomes non-Gaussian on certain time intervals when the magnetization converges algebraically at either zero temperature or critical temperatures. Near critical points in the parameter space, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation, construct the families of equilibrium distributions, and formulate scaling laws for transition rates between two stable equilibria. The linear FIM provides considerable freedom to control steady-state bifurcations and their associated equilibrium distributions, which can be desirable for modeling feedback systems across disciplines.</p>

            <p>While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</p>

The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.</p>

            <p>Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales. Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.</p>

These forms occur in correspondence with the natural numbers, loosely analogous to the energy levels in a Bohr atom. We find the remarkable result that one of these helical forms is an excellent candidate for an {\alpha}-helix through seemingly improbable quantum chemistry coincidences that fit the geometrical requirements.

Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion and the transport of exciton-polaritons in an optical conveyor belt</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingran Xu, Chunyu Jia, Xin-Xin Yang</p>
            <p>The growing interest in exciton-polaritons has driven the need to manipulate their motion and engineer their band structures to the forefront of contemporary research. This study explores the band structures that emerge from a spatially modulated potential, ingeniously realized through the use of an optical conveyor belt. By leveraging Bloch theory and conducting a meticulous analysis of the time evolution of polariton intensity in Fourier space, we have derived the energy dispersion relations both analytically and numerically within the context of a static lattice model. For time-dependent potentials, we employ the Lagrange variational method to elucidate the dynamics of polariton motion. Our results reveal that polaritons exhibit linear dispersion and follow linear trajectories with minor oscillations superimposed. This investigation not only deepens our fundamental understanding of exciton-polaritons but also provides a robust tool for advancing photonic devices and exerting precise control over current transport in quantum computing. Our findings pave the way for future innovations in high-speed and high-performance technologies.</p>

            <p>Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yibin Guo, Manuel Schneider, Takis Angelides, Karl Jansen, C.-J. David Lin, Yao Ting Su</p>
            <p>We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated supercon- ducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke</p>
            <p>Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darren Pereira, Leonardo Banchi</p>
            <p>We present a tensor-network-based method for simulating a weakly-measured quantum circuit. In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.</p>

Remarkably, the volume-law phase featuring logarithmic entanglement growth for certain initial states. We attribute this slow entanglement growth to the similarly slow growth of the participation entropy, which bounds the entanglement. Furthermore, the quantum circuit can be mapped to a classical spin model with real positive Boltzmann weights which involves local multi-spin interactions and displays glassy dynamics at finite temperature. We trace the origin of both the slow quantum dynamics and the classical glassiness to the presence of large, non-local symmetry operators. Our work establishes a novel connection between quantum entanglement dynamics and classical glassy behavior, offering a new geometric perspective on entanglement phase transitions.</p>

            <p>The spectral properties, momentum dispersion, and broadening of bulk plasmonic excitations of 25 elemental metals are studied from first principles calculations in the random-phase approximation. Spectral band structures are constructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse dielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the main collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our earlier model based on multipole-Padé approximants (MPA) to incorporate both momentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic quasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic energy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and overlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also find good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the optical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point that can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in plasmonics and spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg</p>
            <p>Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703 (2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously reported.</p>

            <p>In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</p>

            <h2>Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tadeusz Kosztołowicz, Aldona Dutkiewicz, Katarzyna D. Lewandowska</p>
            <p>The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with a fractional time derivative of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property different forms of the Cattaneo subdiffusion equation have been proposed. We define the Cattaneo effect as a delay of the ordinary subdiffusion flux activation by a random time. By incorporating this effect into the flux equation we get a Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation (CTSE). We study the CTSE that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) controlled by a time delay probability distribution. A method for deriving CTSE within the standard continuous time random walk model is also shown. As examples, we consider the CTSE with AO being the Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO with a kernel that is a slowly varying function. In the first case the Cattaneo effect disappears over time much faster than in the second one. Based on the Green's functions, the time evolutions of the first passage time distribution and of the mean square displacement of a diffusing molecule, we discuss whether the influence of the Cattaneo effect is significant. In the considered examples, this influence seems to be small. However, a relative probability of finding a molecule at a long distance from the starting point for the CTSE equation with respect to the ordinary subdiffusion equation increases rapidly with distance. Even small changes caused by the Cattaneo effect can lead to different results in modeling processes where a faster appearance of a diffusing object changes the nature of the process. The effect may be important, for example, in modeling the spread of an epidemic when a diffusing object is a source of infection.</p>

            <p>Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s-$wave superconducting Fibonacci chain, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left ($T_{cL}$) and right ($T_{cR}$) ends of the chain. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, a characteristic of quasicrystals. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ reaches up to $66\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $31\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for increasing the superconducting critical temperature.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking phases in many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions that represent transient processes during which some properties of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Connecting the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one within the Baym-Kadanoff scheme, beyond the static mean-field approximation, remains an unresolved, long-standing challenge. We identify the reason why approximations with critical dynamical fluctuations in the Schwinger-Dyson equation lead to a mismatch in the transition temperatures calculated from the high- and low-temperature phases. We propose a solution to this generic problem by excluding anomalous contributions to response functions that do not obey conservation of excitations in their interactions. We illustrate this behavior using the example of an antiferromagnetic state. We reveal that the spectral function in the antiferromagnetic phase exhibits a double-gap structure at zero temperature when the anomalous self-energy is frequency-dependent.</p>

            <p>Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</p>

Rather, it is compatible with a two-parameter, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like flow with a line of fixed points (the many-body localized phase), which terminates into the localization transition critical point. Therefore, we argue that previous studies, which assumed the existence of an isolated Wilson- Fisher fixed point and performed one-parameter finite-size scaling analysis, could not explain the numerical data in a coherent way.</p>

            <p>Crystalline defects critically influence material properties, necessitating accurate simulation methods. Existing approaches, from atomic-scale configurations to continuum elasticity, face inherent limitations in modeling dislocation-induced lattice deformation. The amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model bridges this gap with a mesoscopic description. This paper introduces a computationally efficient Fourier pseudospectral method for solving the APFC equations. The method exploits system periodicity and solution analyticity--the latter's rigorous proof remaining an open question, as discussed herein--to enable precise implementation of periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments on 2D triangular and 3D body-centered cubic lattices demonstrate that the method accurately reproduces the strain fields of edge dislocations, matching continuum theory predictions. These results confirm the APFC model's potential for capturing complex defect structures at the mesoscale, paving the way for simulating more intricate defect dynamics.</p>

We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only allow to predict the vibrational and optical properties of solids but also to understand and disentangle the mechanisms playing a key role in the generation of coherent optical phonons. Recent experiments performed on a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanofilm have shown that a THz pulse launches at least a coherent $A_{1g}^1$ phonon as the transient transmittance measured using an isotropic detection scheme displays oscillations with a frequency matching the frequency of the $A_{1g}^1$ mode measured in Raman experiments. Such an observation can be explained by invoking either a sum frequency process or cubic/quartic phonon-phonon couplings as considered for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound of Bi$_2$Te$_3$. By resorting to group theory and calculating energy surfaces from first-principles, the main phonon-phonon couplings can be identified. Furthermore, a minimal model can be built to compute the dynamics of the Raman active modes coupled to the infrared active mode driven by the experimental THz pulse. Our model firmly establishes that cubic phonon-phonon interactions are relevant as the agreement between the computed and experimental transmittance is noteworthy.</p>

            <p>Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations, and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.</p>

            <p>We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the average position of the center of mass of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium value. This is a manifestation of the non-Markovian nature of the effective evolution of the position of the center of mass, once the degrees of freedom of the medium have been integrated out. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, particularly when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.</p>

            <p>Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerrit Niederhoff, Ryusei Kataoka, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Ingrid Mertig, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Scattering of a Dirac particle by a Berry phase domain wall</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lassaad Mandhour, Farah Bouhadida, Frédéric Piéchon</p>
            <p>Massless Dirac particles are characterized by an effective pseudospin-momentum locking, which is the origin of the peculiar scattering properties of Dirac particles through potential barriers. This pseudospin-momentum locking also governs the quantum geometric properties (such as the Berry phase and Berry curvature) of Dirac particles. In the present work, we demonstrate that a domain wall separating two regions with distinct quantum geometric properties can serve as an alternative to potential barriers. Specifically, using the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ model of two-dimensional Dirac particles, we show that a Berry phase domain wall results in partial reflection and transmission of the Dirac particles, despite the fact that the incident and refracted momenta are identical.</p>

            <p>We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.</p>

            <h2>Freezing line of polydisperse hard spheres via direct-coexistence simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg</p>
            <p>In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Interestingly, for sufficiently high polydispersity, this leads to a crystal phase with a lower number density than that of the coexisting fluid. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid-crystal interface, including the surface stress and interfacial absorption.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi</p>
            <p>Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</p>

            <p>Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), $L1_0$-ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe $3d$ electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment $m_\text{T}$, which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe $3d$ electrons. Detected finite $m_\text{T}$ indicates that the spin-polarized Fe $3d$ electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This $m_\text{T}$ of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA, and reduces the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ from the Perspective of Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guan-Hao Feng, Jun Quan, Yusheng Hou</p>
            <p>The recently discovered superconductor $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high transition temperature ($T_{c}$) under high pressure. Shortly after this discovery, thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ was demonstrated to exhibit ambient-pressure superconductivity; however, the corresponding $T_c$ is only about half that of the pressurized bulk material. This striking difference raises questions about the underlying mechanisms governing superconductivity in these two structures. To address this issue, we develop a symmetry-based method that investigates superconducting pairings solely based on experimentally determined symmetry and $T_c$, without assuming any specific superconducting parameters. Applying this approach, we find that both pressurized bulk and thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ exhibit $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing symmetry and two-gap superconductivity, yet their dominant microscopic origins are distinct. In the pressurized bulk, superconductivity is dominated by out-of-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, while in the thin film, in-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals prevails. Furthermore, the observed reduction in $T_c$ can be attributed to this transition of the dominant pairing types, driven by the decreased ratio of inter-layer to intra-layer hoppings in the thin film. Our result sheds lights on the microscopic pairings in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ and reveal the significance of the symmetry. This method can potentially be generalized to a broader range of unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</p>

            <p>Hysteresis and memory effects in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer unique opportunities for neuromorphic computing, sensing, and memory applications, yet their physical origins remain debated due to competing volatile and nonvolatile interpretations. Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.</p>

            <h2>Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents: Application in a non-integer dimensional Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira</p>
            <p>Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.</p>

            <h2>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p>We report measurements of the in-plane and interlayer magnetoresistances of FeSe. The in-plane magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)$ for $B \parallel c$ is positive below $T_s$ and increases with decreasing temperature, exceeding 2.5 at $T$ = 10 K and $B$ = 14 T. The field-direction dependence indicates that the in-plane magnetoresistance is basically determined by the $c$-axis component of the magnetic field. The interlayer magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)$ is negative below $T_s$ but turns positive below $\sim$18 K, which is probably due to the contamination by the large in-plane magnetoresistance. The field-direction dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance can approximately be described by a standard formula for quasi-two-dimensional electron systems except near $B \parallel ab$. The experimental magnetoresistance near $B \parallel ab$ is larger than the formula, which can be attributed to the so-called interlayer coherence peak. The large width of the peak indicates the correspondingly large interlayer transfer energy.</p>

            <p>Lithium zirconium chlorides (LZCs) present a promising class of cost-effective solid electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state batteries. The unique crystal structure of LZCs plays a crucial role in facilitating lithium-ion mobility, which further affects its electrochemical performance. To understand the underlying mechanism governing ion transport, we employed deep learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation on Li2ZrCl6 (trigonal {\alpha}- and monoclinic \b{eta}-LZC), focusing specifically on the zirconium coordination environment. Our results reveal that disordered {\alpha}-LZC exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, while \b{eta}-LZC demonstrates significantly lower conductivity, closely aligning with experimental findings. The study confirms that across all phases, lithium migration proceeds via site-to-site hopping mechanism, where variations in site residence times critically impact the overall ionic conductivity. In {\alpha}-LZCs, lithium ions prefer to anisotropically diffuse across interlayers as the result of lower energy barrier, driven primarily by collective diffusion. In contrast, lithium ions in \b{eta}-LZC primarily isotropically diffuse within intralayer, hindered by higher energy barriers and determined by individual diffusion. The variation in ZrCl62- octahedral unit softening, induced by the specific layered arrangement of zirconium atoms, emerges as a critical determinant of the energy barriers across the LZC phases. These atomic-scale insights into the transport processes provide valuable guidance for the rational design and optimization of LZCs-based electrolytes, accelerating their practical application in advanced energy storage technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin P. Bergfield</p>
            <p>Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $Büttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</p>

Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.</p>

            <p>Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+ (S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K. We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing, respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations, consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.</p>

            <p>The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahana Chakraborty, Michele Pini, Martina S. Zündel, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</p>

            <p>Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian B. Voits, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)</p>
            <p>Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it affects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph-theoretical interpretation of the mean first-passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for large networks as well as with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog. We also discuss under which conditions this generic response can be violated, for example for linear chains, which have only one spanning tree.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yann Lanoiselée, Gianni Pagnini, Agnieszka Wyłomańska</p>
            <p>The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</p>

            <p>The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size-tunable emission and high quantum yield, make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single-cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, we present an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and single-photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.</p>

            <p>Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanyu Ma, Andrew K. Mitchell, Eran Sela</p>
            <p>When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</p>

            <p>We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasiconserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing crossover to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the crossover.</p>

            <p>Traditionally applied within equilibrium states, the charge-vortex dualities are expanded to address the complex dynamics of superfluids and ideal fluids under non-static conditions. We have constructed explicit mappings of finite temperature fluid dynamics to gauge theories, enabling a dual description where vortices in both superfluids and ideal fluids are interpreted as charges within these theories. We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Liénard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.</p>

The analytical result consistently describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic diffusive regime at low frequencies and wavenumbers, and the quantum, zero-temperature regime at high frequencies and wavenumbers. We analytically resolve the successive collisions between the diffusive pole and the non-hydrodynamic poles sourced by the infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ geometry. We demonstrate that in the $T=0$ limit, a pair of gapless poles survive with a dispersion relation $\omega_\pm=-i d_2 k^2-i d_4 k^4-i\tilde d_4 k^4(\pm i\pi+\log k^2) $. The nonanalytic contributions arise from the interplay with the branch cut formed by the condensation of the non-hydrodynamic poles. The real part is caused by the `snatching' of one of the non-hydrodynamic poles by the hydrodynamic diffusive pole.</p>

            <h2>Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.</p>

This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</p>

            <p>In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case (off criticality).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tan Van Vu, Ryotaro Honma, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems that interact with their environments at arbitrary coupling strengths and are subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained not only by entropy production but also by this asymmetry. For general observables, we further prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term that characterizes environmental changes. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental limits of precision in a broad class of open quantum systems, beyond the traditional Markovian setting.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.</p>

            <p>Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter A. Noordman, Lucas Maisel Licerán, Henk T. C. Stoof</p>
            <p>Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.</p>

            <p>Nano-patterned semiconductor interfaces offer a versatile platform for creating quantum metamaterials and exploring novel electronic phenomena. In this study, we illustrate this concept using artificial graphene--a metamaterial featuring distinctive properties including Dirac and saddle points. We demonstrate that introducing additional nano-patterning can open a Dirac band gap, giving rise to what we term artificial hexagonal boron nitride (AhBN). The calculated valley Chern number of AhBN indicates the presence of topological valley Hall states confined to Dirac-gap domain walls. A key question is whether these one-dimensional edge states are topologically protected against disorder, given their vulnerability to Anderson localization. To this end, we perform band structure and electronic transport simulations under experimentally relevant disorder, including charge puddles and geometric imperfections. Our results reveal the resilience of the domain wall states against typical experimental disorder, particularly while the AhBN band gap remains open. The localization length along the domain wall can reach several microns--several times longer than the bulk electron mean free path--even though the number of bulk transport channels is greater. To enhance the effectiveness of the low-dissipation domain wall channel, we propose ribbon geometries with a large length-to-width ratio. These findings underscore both the potential and challenges of AhBN for low-energy, power-efficient microelectronic applications.</p>

While most van der Waals multilayers have featured inorganic monolayers, incorporating molecular monolayers introduces new degrees of tunability and functionality. Here, we investigate hybrid bilayers composed of atomically thin perylene-based molecular crystals interfaced with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically MoS2 and WS2. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict emergent properties beyond those of the isolated constituent systems. Notably, we find substantial renormalization of monolayer molecular crystal band gap due to TMD-induced polarization. Furthermore, by varying the TMD monolayer, we demonstrate tuning of the energy level alignment of the bilayer and subsequent control over a diversity of lowest-energy excitons, which include strongly bound hybrid excitons and long-lived charge-transfer excitons. These findings establish organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures as a promising class of materials for tunable optoelectronic devices and quantum excitonic phenomena, expanding the design space for low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots offer a gate-tunable platform for quantum information processing. While two-qubit interactions are typically realized through exchange coupling between neighboring spins, coupling spin qubits to photons via hybrid spin-cQED devices enables long-range interactions and integration with other cQED platforms. Here, we investigate hole spin-photon coupling in compact single quantum dot setups. By incorporating ubiquitous strain inhomogeneities to our theory, we identify three main spin-photon coupling channels: a vector-potential-spin-orbit geometric mechanism--dominant for vertical magnetic fields--, an inhomogeneous Rashba term generalizing previous spin-orbit field models, and strain-induced $g$-tensor terms--most relevant for in-plane fields. Comparing Si, unstrained (relaxed) Ge, and biaxially strained Ge wells, we find that Si and unstrained Ge provide optimal coupling strengths (tens of MHz) thanks to their reduced heavy-hole, light-hole splitting. We demonstrate efficient switching of the spin-photon coupling while preserving sweet spot operation. Finally, we evaluate quantum state transfer and two-qubit gate protocols, achieving $>99\%$ fidelity for state transfer and $>90\%$ for two-qubit gates with realistic coherence times, establishing single-dot hole spins as a viable platform for compact spin-cQED architectures and highlighting unstrained Ge as a promising candidate for spin-photon interactions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum oscillations and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the quasi-two-dimensional Dirac nodal line superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$</h2>

            <p>Recent interest in quantum materials has focused on systems exhibiting both superconductivity and non-trivial band topology as material candidates to realize topological or unconventional superconducting states. So far, superconductivity in most topological materials has been identified as type II. In this work, we present magnetotransport studies on the quasi-two-dimensional type I superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$. Combined ab initio DFT calculations and quantum oscillation measurements confirm that $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ is a Dirac nodal line semimetal in the normal state. The complex Fermi surface morphology is evidenced by the non-monotonic angular dependence of both the quantum oscillation amplitude and the magnetoresistance. Our results establish $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ as a candidate material platform for exploring the interplay between band topology and superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Full counting statistics of electron-photon hybrid systems: Joint statistics and fluctuation symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Xiao, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of efficient quantum light-matter interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Origin of trapped intralayer Wannier and charge-transfer excitons in moiré materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indrajit Maity, Johannes Lischner, Arash A. Mostofi, Ángel Rubio</p>
            <p>Moiré materials offer a versatile platform for engineering excitons with unprecedented control, promising next-generation optoelectronic applications. While continuum models are widely used to study moiré excitons due to their computational efficiency, they often disagree with ab initio many-body approaches, as seen for intralayer excitons in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. Here, we resolve these discrepancies using an atomistic, quantum-mechanical framework based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with localized Wannier functions as the basis for the electronic structure. We show that inclusion of dielectric screening due to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation is essential to reproduce the full set of experimentally observed features of moiré intralayer excitons. Our analysis reveals a competition between Wannier and charge transfer characters, driven by variations between direct and indirect band gaps at high symmetry stacking regions due to atomic relaxations and environmentally tunable electron-hole interactions. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that the lowest-energy bright excitons are Wannier-like in WS2/WSe2 heterobilayers but charge-transfer-like in twisted WSe2 homobilayers, despite having comparable moiré lengths when encapsulated in hBN. In the absence of hBN encapsulation, the lowest-energy bright exciton in twisted WSe$_2$ becomes Wannier-like. These results establish atomistic modeling as a powerful and efficient approach for designing and controlling excitonic phenomena in moiré materials.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Mechanism of Colloidal Propulsion through Momentum Exchange</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Diaz, Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Carles Calero</p>
            <p>Propulsion of colloidal particles due to momentum transfer from localized surface reactions is investigated by solving the exact unsteady Stokes equation. We model the effect of surface reactions as either a {\it force dipole} acting on the fluid or a {\it pair force} acting on both the colloid and the fluid. Our analysis reveals that after a single reaction event the colloid's velocity initially decays as $\sim t^{-1/2}$, followed by a long-time tail decay $\sim t^{-5/2}$. This behavior is distinct from the $\sim t^{-3/2}$ decay seen for simple impulsively forced particles, a result of the force-free nature of the reaction mechanism. The velocity and transient dynamics are strongly controlled by the distance of the reaction from the colloid surface. For a colloid subject to periodic reactions, the theory predicts a steady-state velocity that is comparable to experimental results and previous simulations, suggesting that direct momentum transfer is a relevant mechanism for self-propulsion in systems like Janus particles. Finally, our study shows that fluid compressibility is not required for momentum transfer to produce colloidal propulsion.</p>

            <p>Kagome metals have developed into a vibrant playground for materials physics, where geometric frustration, electronic correlations and band topology come together to create a variety of exotic phenomena. Recently synthesized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional superconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of frustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions with different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In particular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density wave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in contrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze charge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of the fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution imaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role of sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral textures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave, and set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry groups in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</p>

            <p>We experimentally study the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using a Rydberg-based quantum processing unit in the analog mode. Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal an exponential decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</p>

            <h2>Proper Theory of Magnon Orbital Angular Momentum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyu Tang, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.</p>

            <p>The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.</p>

            <p>We propose a method to generate pure many-body interactions in colloidal systems by using optical forces induced by random optical fields with an optimized spectral energy density. To assess the feasibility in general settings, we develop a simple model for Lorentzian electric and magnetic dipole response. An optimization procedure is then introduced to design the spectral energy density of the random field that minimizes pair interactions at constant electromagnetic energy density. We conclude that, under rather general circumstances, it is possible to effectively cancel pair interactions within a range of distance. Hence a colloid can be driven to interact exclusively through many-body interactions</p>

            <h2>Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenhaoyue Wang, Carlos J. Garcia-Cervera, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhine Samajdar, Haonan Zhou, R. N. Bhatt</p>
            <p>High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</p>

            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors are promising for quantum computing, yet their unambiguous detection remains challenging. We fabricated Josephson junctions (JJs) using Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal nanoribbons with NbTi superconducting electrodes to investigate topological supercurrents through Fraunhofer pattern analysis. The JJs exhibited excellent quality with high transparency ($\tau$ = 0.77) and large induced superconducting gap ($\Delta$ = 1.10 meV), confirmed by multiple Andreev reflection features. While node lifting at the third minimum of the Fraunhofer pattern was observed as a predicted signature of 4{$\pi$}-periodic topological supercurrents, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that asymmetric supercurrent distributions can reproduce this behavior without invoking MZMs. These findings reveal that anomalous Fraunhofer patterns alone cannot reliably confirm topological superconductivity, necessitating complementary experimental approaches for conclusive Majorana detection</p>

            <p>Sliding ferroelectrics, which exhibit out-of-plane polarization arising from specific stacking rather than conventional ionic displacements, are new types of ferroelectrics whose underdeveloped physics needs to be explored. Here, we investigate for the first time the electro-optic (EO) response of these materials using first-principles calculations, focusing on ZrI$_{2}$ as a prototype. We reveal that, contrary to conventional ferroelectrics, the EO effect in ZrI$_{2}$ is dominated by its electronic contribution rather than the ionic one, which promises faster EO responses. Furthermore, both biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly enhance this response, and a novel, universal-like linear relationship between the band gap and such response is discovered. We also report a large elasto-optic coefficient that is independent of biaxial strain. Similar large linear EO coefficients and properties are found in other sliding ferroelectrics, including different zirconium dihalides, as well as BN and BP bilayers. These findings highlight sliding ferroelectrics as highly promising candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical devices and reveal novel EO mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario Castro, Benjamín Mancilla, Fabian Wolff, Alvaro S. Nunez</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach for generating and controlling spin currents in an antiferromagnetic twisted honeycomb bilayer in response to an elastic deformation. Utilizing a continuum model, closely based upon the seminal Bistritzer-MacDonald model, that captures the essential physics of low-energy moiré bands, we calculate the spin current response to the deformation in terms of the familiar Berry phase formalism. The resulting moiré superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading to emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized piezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to tune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the piezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion symmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN substrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moiré superlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in the $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In contrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field ensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of the valley Chern numbers. These notable physical properties make these systems promising candidates for groundbreaking spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

In this study, we report a unique phase of indium selenide via Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis in the synthesized large-area films -- which we have named the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase. The quintuple layers of the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, characterized by a unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths from the middle selenium atom, are distinct from any other previously reported phase of indium selenide. Cross-sectional STEM analysis has revealed that the $\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibit intralayer shifting. We found that indium selenide films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers display electric-field-induced switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, suggesting the breaking of the inversion symmetry. Experimental observations of nonlinear optical phenomena -- Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses further support this conclusion. This study reports a $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide showing ferroelectricity over large areas at room temperature in a low-dimensional limit.</p>

            <h2>Fractional quantum Hall state at $ν= 1/2$ with energy gap up to 6 K, and possible transition from one- to two-component state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Kumar Singh, Chengyu Wang, Adbhut Gupta, Kirk W. Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Mansour Shayegan</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) observed in the lowest Landau level at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in wide quantum wells has been enigmatic for decades because the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) has a bilayer charge distribution but with significant interlayer tunneling. Of particular interest is whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or two-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian (non-Abelian) or the $\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here our experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an ultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the lowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground state at $\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is increased, a FQHS emerges at $\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite density range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter FQHSs at $\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected daughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES becomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the transitions of FQHSs flanking $\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this transition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an \textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the transition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our observation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\nu=1/2$ to 2C states at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2 FQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also makes a transition from 1C to 2C. Such a transition from a non-Abelian to Abelian state can open avenues for topological quantum information and quantum criticality.</p>

            <h2>Variation Monte Carlo Study on the bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Chen, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused significant interest in exploring the pairing mechanism. Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Novel family of near-room-temperature compensated itinerant pyrochlore ferrimagnets, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Shiotani, T. Waki, Y. Tabata, I. Kézsmárki, H. Nakamura</p>
            <p>We successfully synthesized single crystals of a series of C15b Laves phase compounds, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm), with Co-pyrochlore and $R$-fcc sublattices, and systematically studied their magnetic properties via magnetometry measurements. These itinerant cubic compounds, with Curie temperatures above room temperature, show compensated ferrimagnetism featuring an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two sublattices. From this series, ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$ exhibits the highest $T_{\rm C}$ (= 368 K) and a near-room-temperature compensation point $T_{\rm cp}$ (= 295 K). $T_{\rm C}$ does not change drastically with the $R$ atom, whereas $T_{\rm cp}$ depends on the de Gennes factor of $R^{3+}$. Another magnetization anomaly is observed in all the compounds at low temperatures, which may be indicative of changes in the lattice or magnetic structure. The easy axis the ferrimagnetic moment of ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$, ${\mathrm{ErInCo}}_{4}$, and ${\mathrm{TmInCo}}_{4}$ is found at $T =$ 5 K to be along the [001], [111] and [110] directions, respectively. However, the simple easy-axis or easy-plane ferrimagnetic picture cannot be applied to ${\mathrm{HoInCo}}_{4}$. These observations suggest that the $R$ sublattice determines magnetic anisotropy and compensation, while the Co sublattice plays a role in strong magnetic ordering. The high Curie temperature, together with the magnetization compensation point near room temperature, renders these itinerant pyrochlore magnets interesting for spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Mixing of a binary passive particle system using smart active particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Jacob, Siddhant Mohapatra, Rajalingam A, Sam Mathew, Pallab Sinha Mahapatra</p>
            <p>Controlled activity of active entities interacting with a passive environment can generate emergent system-level phenomena, positioning such systems as promising platforms for potential downstream applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive and reconfigurable materials, microfluidic transport and related fields. The present work aims to realise an optimal mixing of two segregated species of passive particles by introducing a small fraction of active particles (2% by composition) with adaptive and intelligent behaviour, directed by a trained Artificial Neural Network-based agent. While conventional run-and-tumble particles can induce mixing in the system, the smart active particles demonstrate superior performance, achieving faster and more efficient mixing. Interestingly, an optimal mixing strategy doesn't involve a uniform dispersion of active particles in the domain, but rather limiting their motion to an eccentrically placed zone of activity, inducing a global rotational motion of the passive particles about the system centre. A transition in the directionality of the passive particles' motion is observed along the radius towards the centre, likening the active particles' motion to an ellipse-shaped void with a defined surface speed. Situated at the intersection of active matter and machine learning, this work highlights the potential of integrating adaptive learning frameworks into traditional active matter models.</p>

            <h2>Braids and Beams: Exploring Fractional Statistics with Mesoscopic Anyon Colliders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernd Rosenow, Bertrand I. Halperin</p>
            <p>Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.</p>

            <h2>Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Chandra, Mahbub Rahaman, Soumyabroto Majumder, Analabha Roy, Sujit Sarkar</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Elias Abrão, Daan Weltens, Rhodri Mansell, Sebastiaan van Dijken, Lukáš Flajšman</p>
            <p>The use of spin waves in magnetic thin films at cryogenic temperatures has long been hindered by the lack of a suitable material platform. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic conditions.</p>

Until recently, a handful of defects in a small selection of host materials have been possible candidates. Recent developments have revealed that hexagonal boron nitride, a wide-bandgap two-dimensional material, hosts single-photon-emitting atomic defects with access to optically addressable electronic and nuclear spins at room temperature. Now, atomically thin quantum devices that operate at ambient conditions are a possibility. In this perspective, we discuss the recent progress, and challenges, in understanding the fundamental photophysics of defects in hBN, as well as specific opportunities they present for the development of quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Magnetic hyperthermia with metallic nanoparticles is a therapeutic strategy that relies on heating cancer cells to levels sufficient to damage or destroy them. After injection, the nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues, where they transfer energy from the applied time-dependent magnetic field to the surrounding medium, thereby increasing the local temperature. This heating effect can be spatially focused (superlocalized) by combining AC and DC magnetic fields. Heat generation arises either from the rotation of the particle or from the rotation of its magnetic moment. The theoretical framework is provided by the Martsenyuk-Raikher-Shliomis (MRSh) equation for the former and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) equation for the latter. However, by using the concept of magnetic and ordinary viscosity, the results of these approaches can be directly compared, which is our goal in this work, with special emphasis on their ability to achieve spatial localization. On the basis of this comparison, we propose the use of perpendicular AC and DC magnetic fields for image-guided thermal therapy with magnetic particle imaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei Liu, Tamara Christiani, Zhijie Wang, Fei Guo, Mariel Vazquez, M. Carme Calderer, Javier Arsuaga</p>
            <p>DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4, whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase. We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the elastic ratio $\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\alpha \approx 0.0064$, indicating that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity, topology, and observed genome organization.</p>

            <p>Distinguishing active from passive dynamics is a fundamental challenge in understanding the motion of living cells and other active matter systems. Here, we introduce a framework that combines physical modeling, analytical theory, and machine learning to identify and characterize active fluctuations from trajectory data. We train a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network on synthetic trajectories generated from well-defined stochastic models of active particles, enabling it to classify motion as passive or active and to infer the underlying active process. Applied to experimental trajectories of a tracer in the cytoplasm of a living cell, the method robustly identifies actively driven motion and selects an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck active noise model as the best description. Crucially, the classifier's performance on simulated data approaches the theoretical optimum that we derive, and it also yields accurate estimates of the active diffusion coefficient. This integrated approach opens a powerful route to quantify non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex biological systems from limited data.</p>

            <h2>Equilibrium properties of strongly confined fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana M. Montero</p>
            <p>The statistical-mechanical study of the equilibrium properties of fluids, starting from the knowledge of the interparticle interaction potential, is essential to understand the role that microscopic interaction between individual particles play in the properties of the fluid. The study of these properties from a fundamental point of view is therefore a central goal in condensed matter physics. These properties, however, might vary greatly when a fluid is confined to extremely narrow channels and, therefore, must be examined separately. This thesis investigates fluids in narrow pores, where particles are forced to stay in single-file formation and cannot pass one another. The resulting systems are highly anisotropic: motion is free along the channel axis but strongly restricted transversely. To quantify these effects, equilibrium properties of the confined fluids are compared with their bulk counterparts, exposing the role of dimensionality. We also develop a novel theoretical framework based on a mapping approach that converts single-file fluids with nearest-neighbor interactions into an equivalent one-dimensional mixture. This exact isomorphism delivers closed expressions for thermodynamic and structural quantities. It allows us to compute the anisotropic pressure tensor and revises definitions of spatial correlations to take into account spatial anisotropy. The theory is applied to hard-core, square-well, square-shoulder, and anisotropic hard-body models, revealing phenomena such as zigzag ordering and structural crossovers of spatial correlations. Analytical predictions are extensively validated against Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations (both original and from the literature), showing excellent agreement across the studied parameter ranges.</p>

            <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.</p>

            <p>The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</p>

At a critical value $\kappa_{\rm c}$, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from an absorbing state ($\kappa < \kappa_{\rm c}$) to a chaotic steady state ($\kappa > \kappa_{\rm c}$). The chaotic phase is marked by nontrivial spatiotemporal velocity correlations and mixing, reminiscent of active turbulence in self-propelled systems. The sharp onset of chaos shows critical scaling consistent with the universality class of directed percolation. We argue that this transition is generic to a broad class of locally-driven, dense disordered materials.</p>

            <p>The yield strength plateau of two BCC refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) - MoNbTaVW and MoNbTaW was examined through hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. By analyzing atomic diffusivities derived from vacancy formation and migration energies around the edge dislocation cores, the number of critical atomic swaps were calculated at different temperatures. Using hybrid MC/MD simulations of these critical swaps, we demonstrate that above 1400K, the stress required to move the dislocations gets saturated, indicating the effect of Dynamic Strain Ageing (DSA) via cross core motion. Further simulations on random solid solutions (0 MC swaps) revealed a similar plateau effect at the intermediate temperatures. This was attributed to the additional athermal stress arising from lattice distortions due to solid solution strengthening. Our findings suggest that the yield strength plateau results from an interplay between the DSA-driven diffusion process and athermal stress. Specifically, the plateau emerges from DSA mechanisms in the presence of atomic diffusion, whereas in the absence of diffusion, it is governed by athermal statistical lattice distortions. This dual mechanism framework provides a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed Yield strength behavior in RHEAs at intermediate temperatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rémi Busselez</p>
            <p>Understanding the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties is a central challenge in the study of complex fluids. The Kirkwood-Buff (KB) theory offers an elegant and powerful framework for bridging this gap by relating integrals over pair correlation functions to measurable thermodynamic quantities. In multicomponent systems, KB integrals connect directly to derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, including chemical potentials derivatives, partial molar volumes, and isothermal compressibility. While several computational methods exist to estimate KB integrals from molecular simulations, their application often demands careful treatment of finite-size effects and explicit extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Recently, alternative strategies based on the analysis of partial structure factors in reciprocal space have been proposed. Unlike real-space approaches, reciprocal-space methods avoid the additional truncation artifacts associated with direct integration or fluctuations in subensemble. They evaluate density fluctuations across the entire simulation box, fully accounting for periodic boundary conditions rather than relying on subdomains. As a result, these methods offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced numerical stability for estimating KB integrals in complex mixtures. In this work, we extend, compare and validate these methods using binary and quaternary Lennard-Jones mixtures, as well as realistic molecular systems such as hexane-ethanol, water-urea, and aqueous NaCl mixtures. Our results provide practical guidelines for computing KB integrals and associated thermodynamic properties from canonical ensemble simulations, including recommendations on reciprocal-space extrapolation, uncertainty estimation, and linear algebra formulations of thermodynamic derivatives.</p>

            <p>Orbital-selective many-body effects, in which electrons occupying different orbitals experience distinct interaction strengths, play a crucial role in correlated multiorbital materials. However, these effects usually manifest in a complex manner, obscuring their microscopic origins. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements with theoretical calculations, we reveal pronounced orbital selectivity in both electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in the van der Waals material V2Se2O. Electron correlation induces distinct bandwidth renormalization exclusively in the V d_xy-derived band, while the bands mainly composed of the other d orbitals remain essentially unrenormalized. Orbital-resolved analyses identify that the filling number and the bandwidth are decisive factors governing orbital-dependent correlation. Simultaneously, the d_(xz/yz)-derived band exhibits a sharp kink anomaly, arising from enhanced coupling to high-energy phonon modes dominated by oxygen vibrations. Such pronounced orbital selectivity positions V2Se2O as a rare and prototypical platform for unravelling the microscopic mechanisms of orbital-selective electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and offers guiding principles for the design of correlated multiorbital materials.</p>

Angle-resolved optical spectroscopy at room temperature reveals the lower polariton branch dispersions in the linear regime for several detunings. Under circularly polarized, non-resonant laser excitation, the spin injection of high-energy excitons and their relaxation towards the lower polariton branch demonstrates its preservation, in contrast to the bare exciton case. The spin-polarized emission survives due to the fast decay of polaritons. Our results provide promising insights into the non-resonant spin control of polaritonic devices, including chiral lasers and switches.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of Å from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons, such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote, pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p>

            <h2>Correlative Analysis of Iron-Driven Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties in Natural Biotite Crystals</h2>

            <p>Biotite crystals are phyllosilicate trioctahedral micas with the general chemical formula K(Mg,Fe)3AlSi3O10(OH)2 that form a solid-solution series with iron-poor phlogopite and iron-rich annite endmembers. With a wide band gap energy and a layered structure with free surface charges, biotite nanosheets can be readily obtained by cleavage methods and used as dielectrics in nanodevice fabrication for the next generation of electronics and energy harvesting. Here, a comprehensive study of biotite samples with different iron concentrations and oxidation states is presented. Structural, optical, magneto-optical, and magnetic characterizations were performed using several experimental techniques, including state-of-the-art synchrotron-based techniques, to correlate the iron chemistry (content and oxidation state) with the macroscopic properties of both minerals. The study reveals a nanoscale-homogeneous Fe distribution via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping, defect-mediated optical transitions modulated by Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and temperature-dependent magnetic transitions from paramagnetism to competing ferro-/antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the use of these biotite crystals as substrates for ultrathin heterostructures incorporating monolayer (ML) MoSe2 is explored by magneto photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures. The results show that the presence of iron impurities in different oxidation states significantly impacts the valley properties for ML-MoSe2. Overall, these findings offer a comprehensive interpretation of the physical properties of bulk biotites in a correlative approach, serving as a robust reference for future studies aiming to explore biotites in their ultrathin form.</p>

            <h2>Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yintati Zhang, Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Jacek Dziarmaga</p>
            <p>Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</p>

            <p>We report new insights into the electronic, structural, and transport (heat and charge) properties of the phase-change memory material Ge2Sb2Te5. Using realistic structural models of Konstantinou et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3065 (2019)], we analyze the topology, electronic states, and lattice dynamics with density functional methods, including hybrid-functional calculations and machine-learned interatomic potentials. The Kohn-Sham orbitals near the Fermi level display a strong electron-phonon coupling, and exhibit large energy fluctuations at room temperature. The conduction tail states exhibit larger phonon-induced fluctuations than the valence tail states. To resolve transport at the atomic scale, we employ space-projected electronic conductivity and site-projected thermal conductivity methods. Local analysis of heat transport highlights the role of filamentary networks dominated by Te, with Sb and Ge making progressively smaller contributions.</p>

Deen</p>
            <p>The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+ (S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K. We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing, respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations, consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Systematic cRPA study of two-dimensional MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials: From unconventional screening to correlation-driven instabilities</h2>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between screening, electronic correlations, and collective excitations is essential for the design of two-dimensional quantum materials. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than 60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic, cold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb interaction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence across distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal symmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions persist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic effects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable long-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers, highlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron compounds, we find $U_{\mathrm{eff}} > W$ in the $\beta_2$ phase, indicating proximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based systems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W > 1 $ in multiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic instabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally, selected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive low-energy modes. These results position MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers as a versatile platform for investigating correlation-driven instabilities and emergent collective behavior in two dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Sun, Yanxin Feng, Christian D. Santangelo, D. Zeb Rocklin</p>
            <p>Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.</p>

            <p>Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems. Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3 microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is manifested around room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Anyon interactions in the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg model of the fractional quantum Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Leask</p>
            <p>The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Lazzaroni, Shubham Sharma, Mariana Rossi</p>
            <p>We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</p>

            <p>We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra reveal a nearly flat band with pinch-point momentum dependence accompanied by dispersive branches that produce half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics in frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubham Jain, Anurag Tripathi, Jayanta Chakraborty, Jitendra Kumar</p>
            <p>Drum granulation is a size enlargement process where granular material is agitated with a liquid binder to form larger size granules. Discrete element modeling is increasingly being used to better understand and investigate the granulation process. However, unlike experiments the measurement of granule size within a DEM framework often necessitates an explicit quantitative definition of a granule and a corresponding granule identification method. In this work, we show that the existing definitions and the associated methods in literature are ineffective at identifying granules for dense flows such as during drum granulation. We propose an improved definition and granule identification method based on community-detection used in network science literature. The proposed method better identifies granules in a drum granulator as benchmarked against liquid-settling. We also vary granulation process parameters like liquid content and fill level and study their effect on the cumulative granule size distribution attained after drum granulation. We find that the existing granule-identification methods fail to reproduce the well-known effects of process parameters on the cumulative granule size distribution. The proposed method, based on community detection, reproduces the effects with better accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. K. Shargh, C. D. Stiles, J. A. El-Awady</p>
            <p>Ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) are a unique class of biological macromolecules that catalyze the freezing of supercooled water far more efficiently than homogeneous nucleation. Their remarkable efficiency has motivated applications across diverse sectors, including agricultural frost protection, food processing and packaging, biomedical cryopreservation, and even strategies for mitigating glacier ice loss. The ice-nucleation performance of INPs and the mechanical behavior of the ice they produce depend strongly on their structural and biochemical characteristics. However, the links between INP properties, the resulting ice microstructure, and their mechanical behavior have yet to be systematically established. In this study, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations using the machine-learned ML-BOP potential are employed to investigate how varying INP densities influence the ice nucleation temperature, the resulting ice microstructure, and the mechanical behavior of the formed ice under creep tensile loading. We find that, depending on their density, INPs can significantly raise the ice nucleation rate while altering the grain structure of ice. Our simulations reveal that INP-assisted nucleation leads to faster stabilization of the resulting polycrystalline ice composed of hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic) as compared to nucleation in pure water. Moreover, higher INP densities and smaller ice grain sizes reduce the overall yield stress, while promoting diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding creep. These findings provide molecular-level insight into how INPs influence both the nucleation process and the mechanical behavior of ice, highlighting a pathway to engineer ice with tailored stability for real-world settings, including human activities and infrastructure in polar and icy environments.</p>

            <p>We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</p>

            <h2>Atomistic Insights into the Degradation of Metal Phthalocyanine Catalysts during Oxygen Reduction Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huanhuan Yang, Guangfu Luo</p>
            <p>Oxygen reduction catalysts frequently suffer from degradation under harsh operating conditions, and the limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this study, we integrate first-principles calculations with a time-dependent microkinetic model to investigate the deactivation pathways of six highly active metal phthalocyanines (MPc, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Rh, and Ir) during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We quantitatively assess the ORR processes, hydrogen peroxide generation, radical generation, and three primary degradation mechanisms, namely carbon oxidation, nitrogen protonation, and demetallation, through a reaction network involving 40 chemical species and 75 elementary reactions. Our findings reveal that the dominant degradation mechanism varies significantly across the MPcs. Under typical alkaline conditions, the primary byproducts arise from carbon oxidation, driven by .OH radical attack and structural reorganization of surface adsorbates, and from protonation at either the metal center or nitrogen sites. In the kinetics-controlled region, the ORR activity follows the order of RhPc > IrPc > FePc > MnPc > RuPc > CrPc. Notably, RhPc and IrPc demonstrate both higher ORR activity and greater stability than the widely studied FePc under elevated potentials.</p>

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals charge transfer from the substrate, populating the conduction band of monolayer CrSBr, accompanied by a pronounced reduction in the quasiparticle band gap. Furthermore, we observe two separate conduction bands that exhibit a splitting at the X point. This indicates a breaking of glide-mirror symmetry, which in the bulk or in a free-standing monolayer protects the band degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary. Our results demonstrate that ultraflat gold substrates do more than modify carrier densities and screening: they can lift symmetry-protected degeneracies and thus fundamentally reshape the band topology of 2D materials.</p>

The HEOM approach describes the system-bath correlated dynamics. Furthermore, we also develop a functional derivative scheme that provides exact expressions for the transport observables in terms of the auxiliary density operators introduced in the HEOM formulation. The superoperator formalism establishes a solid theoretical foundation for analyzing key transport signatures that may uncover the unique characteristics of Majorana physics in mesoscopic systems.</p>

            <p>The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent quantum magnetism.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are transforming materials science and engineering by enabling the study of complex phenomena, such as those critical to battery operation. In this work, we benchmark the MACE machine learning model against a well-trained DeePMD potential for predicting interstitial lithium diffusivity in LiF, a key component in the solid electrolyte interphase in Li ion batteries. Our results demonstrate that the MACE-MPA-0 foundational model achieves comparable accuracy to well-trained DeePMD, in predicting key diffusion properties based on molecular dynamics simulation, while requiring minimal or no training data. For instance, the MACE-MPA-0 predicts an activation energy Ea of 0.22 eV, the fine-tuned model with only 300 data points predicts Ea = 0.20 eV, both of which show good agreement with the DeePMD model reference value of Ea = 0.24 eV. In this work, we provide a solid test case where fine-tuning approaches - whether using data generated for DeePMD or data produced by the foundational MACE model itself - yield similar robust performance to the DeePMD potential trained with over 40,000 actively learned data, albeit requiring only a fraction of the training data.</p>

            <p>Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) can potentially offer exceptional material properties, but their complex, costly manufacturing limits their scalability. Chemical complexity and complex manufacturing processes lead to the formation of some secondary phases, which have a significant impact on the final properties. In this work, chromium compound dispersoid enhancements (Cr- oxides and carbides) were formed in CoCrFeNi MPEAs to enhance their microstructural and high-temperature mechanical properties. A single FCC phase was observed in the arc melted (AM) samples, chromium oxides were detected in the gas-atomized (GA) samples, and Cr2O3 with Cr23C6 or Cr7C3 was found in the mechanically alloyed (MA)samples depending on the sintering temperature. Mechanical tests at room temperature and 575°C, where no phase evolution is expected, showed that the GA samples with oxides achieved enhanced mechanical properties at 575°C. This was co-induced by precipitation strengthening, recrystallization suppression, and twinning-induced plasticity. The MA samples with carbides exhibited high strength but low ductility, with Cr7C3 outperforming Cr23C6 because of its lower hardness and twinning effects. This work links chromium compound evolution to mechanical performance of MPEAs, offering insights to optimize HEA production for high-temperature applications through controlled phase formation.</p>

Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.</p>

            <h2>Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ola Carlsson, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Jonathan B. Curtis, Frieder Lindel, Lorenzo Graziotto, Jérôme Faist, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra Becker, Holger Lippold, Michael Hirscher, Cornelius Fischer</p>
            <p>Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopologues is crucial for applications such as the recycling of exhaust streams in nuclear fusion reactors. Using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), we report, for the first time, on separation experiments of a ternary 1,2,3H isotope mixture, achieving tritium enrichment of 70% from an initially equimolar (1:1:1) gas mixture, based on selective adsorption using an Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite type Y. Further experiments on binary hydrogen isotope mixtures validated numerical predictions of the separation efficiency for T2. Specifically, the high selectivity for tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent candidate for energy-efficient isotope separation at liquid-nitrogen temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morgan D. Sanger, Gabrielle Campagnola, Robin Ritchey, Tuncer B. Edil, Matthew Ginder-Vogel</p>
            <p>Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aryan Patel</p>
            <p>Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Zagrebnov (I2M)</p>
            <p>This short review is devoted to celebration of two major events in quantum physics. The first one is the birth of the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation (1925) and the second is the experimental proof that it does exist and appears in the liquid 4He simultaneously with superfluidity below the $\lambda$-point (1975). The both of these events are tightly related to the Bogoliubov theory of superfluidity (1947). The existence of condensate in the system of interacting bosons is the key ansatz of this theory. Therefore, the experiments started in JINR in 1975 confirmed this prediction of the Bogoliubov theory that superfluidity of the liquid 4He (He II) should emerge at the same time as the Bose-Einstein condensation.</p>

            <p>Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state transitions at different incident photon energies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Ammon, Jette Germerodt, Christoph Sieling, Julio Virrueta</p>
            <p>We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashley Lenau, Dennis Dimiduk, Stephen R. Niezgoda</p>
            <p>A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting model variation are also shared.</p>

            <h2>Dimension dependence of critical phenomena in long-range percolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Hutchcroft</p>
            <p>Statistical mechanical systems at and near their points of phase transition are expected to exhibit rich, fractal-like behaviour that is independent of the small-scale details of the system but depends strongly on the dimension in which the model is defined. Moreover, many models are conjectured to have an upper critical dimension with important quantitative and qualitative differences between critical behaviour at, above, and below the upper critical dimension. For models with long-range interactions, one expects additional transitions between effectively long-range and effectively short-range regimes, with further marginal effects on the boundary of these two regimes, leading to (at least) eight qualitatively distinct forms of critical behaviour in total for each given model. We give a broad overview of these conjectures aimed at a general mathematical audience before surveying the significant recent progress that has been made towards understanding them in the context of long-range percolation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhajit Sarkar, Gabriela Wójtowicz, Bartłomiej Gardas, Marek M. Rams, Michael Zwolak</p>
            <p>We examine the stationary--state equations for lattices with generalized Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the single--particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov's equation. We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super--diffusive--to--diffusive transition in a lattice with long--range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to $10^4$ sites, representing an increase of $10$ to $40$ times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine--learning--based classification and extended reservoir approaches (ERAs) for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor network (TN) states have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can significantly reduce entanglement, mitigating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeongwoo Jae, Junghee Ryu, Hoon Ryu</p>
            <p>We employ the operational quasiprobability (OQ) as a work distribution, which reproduces the Jarzynski equality and yields the average work consistent with the classical definition. The OQ distribution can be experimentally implemented through the end-point measurement and the two-point measurement scheme. Using this framework, we demonstrate the explicit contribution of coherence to the fluctuation, the average, and the second moment of work. In a two-level system, we show that non-joint measurability, a generalized notion of measurement incompatibility, can increase the amount of extractable work beyond the classical bound imposed by jointly measurable measurements. We further prove that the real part of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and the OQ are equivalent in two-level systems, and they are nonnegative for binary unbiased measurements if and only if the measurements are jointly measurable. In a three-level Nitrogen-vacancy center system, the OQ and the KDQ exhibit different amounts of negativities while enabling the same work extraction, implying that the magnitude of negativity is not a faithful indicator of nonclassical work. These results highlight that coherence and non-joint measurability play fundamental roles in the enhancement of work.</p>

            <p>We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.</p>

            <p>Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</p>

By adjusting the system parameters, we identify a harmonic dynamical regime of the atomic population that can be treated analytically, providing a complete description of the system's behaviour for precise manipulation. We demonstrate three independent modes of control over the atomic population dynamics under the action of an external field: frequency tuning via variation in the field intensity, directional switching via spatial displacement of the field, and amplitude modulation by varying its duration. These modes operate under two distinct configurations: one source and two drains, and, in reverse order, two sources and one drain. These cases emulate an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer, respectively. Our results may contribute to the development of control mechanisms in the design of quantum devices.</p>

These results offer a powerful tool for exploring quantum circuit complexity across diverse settings. As applications, we derive stronger constraints on the complexity of AQEC codes with transversal logical gates and establish strong complexity lower bounds for W state preparation.

This continuum model breaks chiral symmetry but still shows a pairing of partner states with positive and negative energies except for the ground state. We perform a corresponding symmetry analysis which illuminates the continuum models structure as compared to a corresponding chirally symmetric Hamiltonian.</p>

We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Honma, Tan Van Vu</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.</p>

            <h2>Surface Acoustic Wave Gas Sensors: Innovations in Functional Materials, Sensing Dynamics, and Signal Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Acharya, Balasubramanian Srinivasan, David Shanahan, Utz Roedig, Alan O Riordan, Veda Sandeep Nagaraja</p>
            <p>Surface Acoustic Wave gas sensors have garnered increasing attention as highly sensitive, miniaturized, and wireless compatible platforms for molecular detection. Their unique ability to convert surface perturbations into measurable acoustic shifts makes them ideal for gas sensing across diverse environments. This review synthesizes reported SAW platforms across substrates and modes Rayleigh, SH-SAW, Love links transduction pathways to material choice, and benchmarks performance for key analytes, e.g., NO2, NH3, VOCs, CO2, etc. We catalogue nanostructured oxides, polymers, carbon based films, and hybrid heterojunction coatings, highlighting attributes such as porosity, surface chemistry, and interfacial charge transfer that govern sensitivity and reversibility. We also highlight the emerging use of SAW devices to probe adsorption desorption dynamics, offering analyte specific interaction signatures beyond equilibrium, offering a new perspective into analyte specific interaction pathways. Additionally, the integration of machine learning is discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and review recent strategies to address them. Looking ahead, we envision the evolution of SAW platforms into intelligent, autonomous sensing systems with applications in environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare diagnostics.</p>

            <h2>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the thermalization of open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Tejero</p>
            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Non-local electrical detection of spin-polarized surface currents in the 3D topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaham Jafarpisheh, Frank Volmer, Zhiwei Wang, Bárbara Canto, Yoichi Ando, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten</p>
            <p>The spin-polarized surface states in topological insulators offer unique transport characteristics that make them distinguishable from trivial conductors. Here, we detect the impact of these surface states in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$ by electrical means using a non-local transport configuration with ferromagnetic Co/Al$_2$O$_3$ electrodes. We show that the non-local measurement allows to probe the surface currents flowing along the whole surface, i.e.~from the top along the side to the bottom surface and back to the top surface along the opposite side. Increasing the temperature increases the interaction between bulk and surface states, which shortens this non-local current path along the surface and hence leads to a complete disappearance of the non-local signal at around 20K. Interestingly, we observe that the ratio between spin signal to background signal is much larger in the non-local geometry compared to the local one. Given that the observed ratio in the non-local geometry aligns well with expectations for spin-polarized surface states, our findings suggest that an as-yet unresolved mechanism diminishes the spin signal in the local geometry.</p>

We numerically study the extreme value statistics of entanglement spectra of many-body localized eigenstates.

We report the surprising observation of Gumbel statistics. Our result provides an analytical, parameter-free characterization of many-body localized eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Sensitivity of the spectral form factor to short-range level statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wouter Buijsman, Vadim Cheianov, Vladimir Gritsev</p>
            <p>The spectral form factor is a dynamical probe for level statistics of quantum systems. The early-time behaviour is commonly interpreted as a characterization of two-point correlations at large separation. We argue that this interpretation can be too restrictive by indicating that the self-correlation imposes a constraint on the spectral form factor integrated over time. More generally, we indicate that each expansion coefficient of the two-point correlation function imposes a constraint on the properly weighted time-integrated spectral form factor. We discuss how these constraints can affect the interpretation of the spectral form factor as a probe for ergodicity. We propose a new probe, which eliminates the effect of the constraint imposed by the self-correlation. The use of this probe is demonstrated for a model of randomly incomplete spectra and a Floquet model supporting many-body localization.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi-liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hideaki Maebashi, Chandra M. Varma</p>
            <p>We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moiré twisted bi-layer graphene and bi-layer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear in temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those due to Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi-surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi-surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</p>

            <h2>Critical fates induced by the interaction competition in three-dimensional tilted Dirac semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Wang, Jie-Qiong Li, Wen-Hao Bian, Qiao-Chu Zhang, Xiao-Yue Ren</p>
            <p>The interplay among Coulomb interaction, electron-phonon coupling, and phonon-phonon coupling has a significant impact on the low-energy behavior of three-dimensional type-I tilted Dirac semimetals. To investigate this phenomenon, we construct an effective theory, calculate one-loop corrections arising from all these interactions, and establish the coupled energy-dependent flows of all associated interaction parameters by adopting the renormalization-group approach. Deciphering such coupled evolutions allows us to determine a series of low-energy critical properties for these materials. At first, we present the low-energy tendencies of all interaction parameters. The tilting parameter exhibits distinct tendencies that depend heavily upon the initial anisotropy of fermion velocities. In comparison, the latter is mainly dominated by its initial value but is less sensitive to the former. Variations in these two quantities drive certain interaction parameters toward the strong anisotropy in the low-energy regime, indicating the screened interaction in specific directions, and others toward an approximate isotropy. Additionally, we observe that the tendencies of interaction parameters can be qualitatively clustered into three distinct types of fixed points, accompanied by the potential instabilities that induce an interaction-driven phase transition to a certain superconducting state. Furthermore, approaching these fixed points leads to the critical behavior of physical quantities, such as the density of states, compressibility, and specific heat, which exhibit quite different from their noninteracting counterparts and even deviate slightly from Fermi-liquid behavior. Our investigation sheds light on the intricate relationship between different types of interactions in these semimetals and provides useful insights into their fundamental properties.</p>

            <p>This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modelling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Feng Huang, Michael te Vrugt, Jonas Mayer Martins, Raphael Wittkowski, Hartmut Löwen</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive a field theory for the case of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from the microscopic particle dynamics, leading to a generic continuum model termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between nonreciprocity and competition of interparticle forces. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</p>

            <p>We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$ spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases, with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.</p>

Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) 1D circuits defined on spherical 2DEGs. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset shifting the AC pattern. We discuss 1D triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.</p>

            <p>Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</p>

Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening.

            <p>Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio-frequency cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented by Zarea {\it et al.} [Front. Supercond. Mater. 3, 1 (2023), arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported by Ueki {\it et al.} [Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 5, 053I02 (2025), arXiv:2207.14236] points toward a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</p>

            <p>This article explores the hysteretic behavior and the damping features of sheared granular media using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We consider polydisperse non-cohesive frictional spherical particles, enclosed in a container with rigid but moving walls, submitted to a cyclic simple shear superimposed to a confining pressure. The mechanical response of the grains is analyzed in the permanent regime, by fitting the macroscopic stress-strain relation applied to the box with a Dahl-like elasto-frictional model. The influence of several parameters such as the amplitude of the strain, the confining pressure, the elasticity, the friction coefficient, the size and the number of particles are explored. We find that the fitted parameters of our macroscopic Ansatz qualitatively rely on both a well-established effective medium theory of confined granular media and a well-documented rheology of granular flow. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that the single degree-of-freedom elasto-frictional reduced model reliably describes the nonlinear response of the granular layer over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, we show that the mechanical response of a granular slab under simple shear depends on an unique dimensionless parameter, akin to an effective Coulomb threshold, at low shear/high pressure. Further, exploring higher shear/lower pressure, we evidence an optimal damping at the crossover between a loose unjammed regime and a dense elastic regime.</p>

            <p>Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches.

We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.</p>

            <p>The ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to implement atomtronics and Josephson junctions analogous to superconducting circuits. The collective modes of a Bose gas split by a potential barrier have been known. However, the role of barriers on the collective excitation spectra of ultracold atomic mixtures has not been examined. Here, we examine the low-lying collective modes of (an)harmonically trapped quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson barrier by employing the variational approach and Bogoliubov theory. We first show that the anharmonicity of the external potential leads to an increase in the critical barrier strength of mode softening in a single-species condensate. The Josephson barrier drives the softening of in-phase and out-of-phase dipole modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates, and consequently leads to two additional zero-energy Goldstone modes in the miscible phase, in agreement with the variational approach. Furthermore, the sandwich immiscible state results in an additional Goldstone mode due to the barrier, in contrast to the spatially symmetry-broken side-by-side profile. Our results unveil the distinct collective response of the Josephson barrier in binary mixtures owing to interspecies atomic correlations.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction and the Raman-induced SOC. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</p>

            <h2>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semsi Coskun, Davood Damircheli, Robert Lipton</p>
            <p>A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with thermodynamics. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</p>

            <p>An introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the $\lambda$-transition is given. Results of quantum loop Monte Carlo simulations are presented for interacting Lennard-Jones helium-4. The optimum condensation fraction is found by minimizing the constrained free energy. The results show that approaching the transition the growth of pure position permutation loops and the consequent divergence of the heat capacity are enabled by the suppression of condensation and consequently of superfluidity. Condensation and superfluidity emerge at the peak of the heat capacity due to mixed position permutation chains.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion of intruders in a granular gas thermostatted by a bath of elastic hard spheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó</p>
            <p>The Boltzmann kinetic equation is considered to compute the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruders in a granular gas. Intruders and granular gas are immersed in a gas of elastic hard spheres (molecular gas). We assume that the granular particles are sufficiently rarefied so that the state of the molecular gas is not affected by the presence of the granular gas. Thus, the gas of elastic hard spheres can be considered as a thermostat (or bath) at a fixed temperature $T_g$. In the absence of spatial gradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the granular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy nonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature ratio $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c_0$ associated with the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations for conditions of practical interest. For states close to the steady homogeneous state, the Boltzmann equation for the intruders is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in the spatial gradients. As expected, the diffusion transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first-Sonine approximation. In dimensionless form, the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of the mass and diameter ratios, the coefficients of restitution, and the (reduced) bath temperature. Interestingly, previous results derived from a suspension model based on an effective fluid-solid interaction force are recovered when $m/m_g\to \infty$ and $m_0/m_g\to \infty$, where $m$, $m_0$, and $m_g$ are the masses of the granular, intruders, and molecular gas particle, respectively. Finally, as an application of our results, thermal diffusion segregation is exhaustively analysed.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects based on a multi-temperature kinetic model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Zhang, Houssem Rezgui, Meng Lian, Hong Liang</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium transport and phonon branch-resolved size effects in single-layer graphene materials are studied under a multi-temperature kinetic model, which is developed for capturing the branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Compared with typical macroscopic multi-temperature models, the assumption of diffusive phonon transport is abandoned in this model and replaced by the free migration and scattering of particles. The phonon branch- and size-dependent effective thermal conductivity is predicted in nanosized graphene as well as the temperature slips near the boundaries. Compared with other phonon branches, the ZA branch contributes the most to thermal conduction regardless of system sizes. Furthermore, in nanosized homogeneous graphene with a hotspot at the center, the branch-dependent thermal conductivity increases from the inside to the outside even if the system size is fixed. The thermal conductivity of ZA branch is even higher than the lattice thermal conductivity when the system size is hundreds of nanometers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minakshi Subhadarshini, Archana Mishra, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the noncollinear magnetic texture effect on second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) phase generated in unconventional $d$-wave superconductors and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.</p>

            <p>Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</p>

            <p>Understanding the mechanism driving magnetization switching in spin-orbit-torque-assisted devices remains a subject of debate. While originally attributed to the spin Hall effect and spin Rashba-Edelstein effect, recent discoveries related to orbital moments induced by the orbital Hall effect and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect have added complexity to the comprehension of the switching process in non-magnet/ferromagnet bilayers. Addressing this challenge, we present a quantitative investigation of a Pt/Co bilayer by employing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, incorporating the proximity-induced moments of Pt, as well as electrically induced spin and orbital moments obtained from first-principles calculations. Our layer-resolved model elucidates the damping-like and field-like nature of the induced moments by separating them according to their even and odd magnetization dependence. In addition to demonstrating that a larger field-like spin-orbit torque contribution comes from previously disregarded induced orbital moments, our work highlights the necessity of considering interactions with Pt induced moments at the interface, as they contribute significantly to the switching dynamics.</p>

            <p>We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent curved space gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. The lensing effect can appear in systems without (emergent) magnetic fields, such as those with coplanar spin textures. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</p>

These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems play a central role in nonequilibrium physics, where determining the energy spectrum under open boundary conditions is a fundamental problem. Non-Bloch band theory, based on the characteristic equation $\text{det}[E - H(\beta)] = 0$, has emerged as a key tool for this task. However, we show that this framework becomes insufficient in systems with certain symmetries, where identical characteristic equations can yield different spectra. To resolve this, we develop a unified theory that incorporates additional wavefunction information beyond the characteristic equation. Our framework accurately captures spectral properties such as the energy spectrum and the end-to-end signal response in a broad class of systems, particularly those with high symmetry. It reveals the essential role of wavefunction information and symmetry in shaping non-Hermitian band theory.</p>

            <p>Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$ and FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.</p>

            <p>Triple-fold or pseudospin-1 semimetals belong to a class of multi-fold materials in which linearly dispersive bands and flat bands intersect at the same point, forming triple-fold crossing points. We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermions, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.</p>

            <p>Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</p>

            <p>Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</p>

            <p>The Berry curvature (BC), a quantity encoding the geometry of electronic wavefunctions, governs various electronic transport effects in quantum materials. In magnetic systems, the BC is reponsible for the intrinsic part of the anomalous Hall conductivity. Local concentrations of BC in non-centrosymmetric materials can lead instead to the quantum nonlinear Hall effect. Here, we argue that the bulk of non-magnetic metals with inversion symmetry, systems where the BC is forced to vanish at any momentum, can be endowed with substantial concentrations of BC even with an infinitesimally small Zeeman coupling. This Zeeman-activated BC, independent of the magnetic field strength and instead related to the degree of non-parabolicity of the electronic bands, couples to the electronic orbital motion to generate a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance that scales with the relaxation time as the Drude resistivity. We show that the Zeeman-actived BC and the related intrinsic negative magnetoresistivity are generic: they appear in all centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in topological and conventional conductors.</p>

            <p>In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows -- a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, \textit{e.g.} regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</p>

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) set a good test case, with tightly bound excitons and designable flexibility that offer an ideal platform for realizing strain effects on exciton energy transfer. Here, we present an ab initio study to construct strain-induced exciton energy profiles and model exciton dynamics on top of these potential surfaces. We focus on inhomogeneously-strained monolayer WS$_2$, combining excitonic band structures derived from many-body perturbation theory for a large variety of strain profiles and calculate the change in mobility characteristics using a semiclassical ballistic transport model. We connect a wealth of strain patterns to exciton drift, diffusion, and confinement. Our results point to strain-induced regimes of super-ballistic propagation and an anomalous effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. Our results provide structure-specific understanding of ballistic strain-tunable exciton behavior, offering design principles for engineering exciton dynamics in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Makhlouf, B. Senjean, E. Fromager</p>
            <p>Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbitals occupation numbers in this context) in strongly correlated systems.</p>
