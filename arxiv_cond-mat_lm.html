            <h2>Nano-optomechanical exploration of the dynamical photothermal response of suspended nanowires to laser-induced thermal waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gouriou Clément, Dousset Cattleya, Fontana Alex, Reigue Antoine, Fogliano Francesco, Weltz Hugo, Judéaux Lucas, Croquette Michael, Pigeau Benjamin, Arcizet Olivier</p>
            <p>Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those ultrasensitive force probes.</p>

            <h2>Hall-on-Toric: Descendant Laughlin state in the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Schäfer, Claudio Chamon, Chris R. Laumann</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometry in the NbSe$_2$ Family I: Obstructed Compact Wannier Function and New Perturbation Theory</h2>

            <p>We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hall Andreev Conversion in Graphene Nanostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Bondarev, William H. Klein, Harold U. Baranger</p>
            <p>We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Quantum Control and Multi-Order Correlations via Terahertz Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuankun Huang, Martin Mootz, Liang Luo, Ilias E. Perakis, Jigang Wang</p>
            <p>Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Engineering Quantum Wire States for Atom Scale Circuitry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Yuan, Lucian Livadaru, Roshan Achal, Jason Pitters, Furkan Altincicek, Robert Wolkow</p>
            <p>Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of quantum coherence in solid-state qubits via interface engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wing Ki Lo, Yaowen Zhang, Ho Yin Chow, Jiahao Wu, Man Yin Leung, Kin On Ho, Xuliang Du, Yifan Chen, Yang Shen, Ding Pan, Sen Yang</p>
            <p>Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors but suffer from noise-induced short coherence times due to bulk and surface impurities. We present interfacial engineering via oxygen termination and graphene patching, extending shallow NV coherence to over 1 ms, approaching the T1 limit. Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory reveal surface termination-driven graphene charge transfer reduces spin noise by pairing surface electrons, supported by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy showing fewer unpaired spins. Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials. This integrated approach advances practical quantum sensing by combining extended coherence, improved sensitivity, and device durability.</p>

            <h2>Ginzburg-Landau theory for unconventional surface superconductivity in PtBi$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harald Waje, Fabian Jakubczyk, Jeroen van den Brink, Carsten Timm</p>
            <p>Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-superconducting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced pair-density waves.</p>

            <p>We report on the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The spectral composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz. Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal (incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.</p>

            <h2>Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun</p>
            <p>The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Insu Baek, Seungyun Han, Hyun-Woo Lee</p>
            <p>d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce Néel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</p>

            <h2>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel F. Martínez, Adolfo G. Grushin, Jens H. Bardarson</p>
            <p>Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of frustration and quantum fluctuations in a spin-1/2 anisotropic square lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. M. Ramos, F. M. Zimmer, M. Schmidt</p>
            <p>Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Radical scaling: beyond our feet and fingers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc-Antoine Fardin, Mathieu Hautefeuille, Vivek Sharma</p>
            <p>Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Liu, Igor Khanonkin, Johannes Eberle, Bernhard Rizek, Stefan Fält, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ataç Imamoğlu, Martin Kroner</p>
            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPE) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising for applications ranging from single-photon sources to quantum sensors. Previous studies exclusively focused on the generation and characterization of SPEs in relatively thick h-BN layers ($\geq$ 30 nm). However, for electrical and magnetic sensing applications, the thickness of the h-BN limits the attainable spatial resolution. Here, we report the observation of blue-wavelength emitters (B-centers) activated by electron beam irradiation in ultra-thin ($\simeq$ 3 nm) h-BN. These SPEs in ultra-thin flakes exhibit reduced brightness, broader zero-phonon line, and enhanced photobleaching. Remarkably, upon encapsulation in thicker h-BN, we restore their brightness, narrow linewidth 230$\mu$eV at 5K, resolution limited), suppress photobleaching, and confirm single-photon emission with $ g^{(2)}(0) < 0.4$ at room temperature. The possibility of generating SPEs in a few-layer h-BN and their subsequent incorporation into a van der Waals heterostructure paves the way for achieving quantum sensing with unprecedented nanometer-scale spatial resolution.</p>

            <h2>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Komeda, Antonio Cammarata, Tomas Polcar</p>
            <p>Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</p>

Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Yafei Ren, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</p>

            <p>We investigate the energy bands, magnetism, and superconductivity of bilayer octagraphene with A-A stacking under a perpendicular electric field. A tight-binding model is used to analyze the band structure of the system. The doubling of the unit cell results in each band of the single layer splitting into two. We find that applying a perpendicular electric field increases the band splitting. As the electric field strength increases, the nesting of the Fermi Surface(FS) weakens, eventually disrupting the antiferromagnetic order and bilayer octagraphene exhibits superconductivity. Spin fluctuations can induce unconventional superconductivity with s+--wave pairing. Applying a perpendicular electric field to bilayer octagraphene parent weakens the nesting of the FS, ultimately killing the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state and transitioning it into the superconducting state, whichworks as a doping effect. We use the random-phase approximation approach to obtain the pairing eigenvalues and pairing symmetries of the perpendicular electric field-tuned bilayer octagraphene in the weak coupling limit. By tuning the strength of the perpendicular electric field, the critical interaction strength for SDW order can be modified, which in turn may promote the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>On the non-integrability of driven-dissipative one-dimensional hard-core bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Zündel</p>
            <p>In one dimension, in a closed system, the Tonks-Girardau gas is integrable even for finite temperatures and time-evolving systems. We address the question if it remains integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider its lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show by using random matrix theory that the statistics of the complex spatial ratio indicates that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe-pattern in the spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.</p>

            <h2>Scattering States in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Baths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimin Li, Yuwen E. Zhang, Franco Nori, Zongping Gong</p>
            <p>A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</p>

            <h2>Geometric orthogonal metals: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and orthogonal metal (OM) phases. The topological nature of FL* and OM phases has been identified as scenarios compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative scenario: an orthogonal metal with a geometric origin (GOM) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GOM framework establishes a deep connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</p>

            <p>In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moiré heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Qu, Martino Stefanini, Tao Shi, Tilman Esslinger, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Jamir Marino, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Recent experiments with quantum simulators using ultracold atoms and superconducting qubits have demonstrated the potential of controlled dissipation as a versatile tool for realizing correlated many-body states. However, determining the dynamics of dissipative quantum many-body systems remains a significant analytical and numerical challenge. In this work, we focus on a dissipative impurity problem as a testbed for new methodological developments. We introduce an efficient non-perturbative framework that combines the superposition of Gaussian states (SGS) variational ansatz with the quantum trajectory approach to simulate open systems featuring a dissipative impurity. Applying this method to a spinful impurity subject to two-body losses and embedded in a bath of noninteracting fermions, we explore the full crossover from weak to strong dissipation regimes. The non-perturbative nature of the SGS ansatz allows us to thoroughly examine this crossover, providing comprehensive insights into the system's behavior. In the strong dissipation regime, our approach reproduces the finding that localized two-body losses can induce the Kondo effect [arXiv:2406.03527], characterized by a slowdown of spin relaxation and an enhancement of charge conductance. Furthermore, we reveal an exotic ``negative conductance" phenomenon at zero potential bias -- a counter-intuitive single-body effect resulting from intermediate dissipation and finite bandwidth. Finally, we investigate the formation of ferromagnetic domains and propose an extension to realize a higher-spin Kondo model using localized dissipation.</p>

            <p>Using high-energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe anomalous softening and damping of the transverse acoustic phonon in UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as the system is cooled towards the charge density wave (CDW) transition temperature, T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The phonon exhibits a marked Kohn-type anomaly around the CDW wave vector, Q$_{\rm{CDW}}$, and becomes overdamped within a finite momentum range already well above T$_{\rm{CDW}}$. The dispersion anomaly is consistent with potential Fermi surface nesting, which together with the extended phonon collapse indicate strong electron-phonon coupling. The transition temperature estimated from the phonon softening is markedly lower than T$_{\rm{CDW}}$, consistent with a primarily electronic instability rather than a phonon-driven transition. Our results establish UPt$_2$Si$_2$ as a prime example of a strongly correlated electron CDW system with exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling driving phonon softening and collapse.</p>

            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Reiners-Sakic, Alexander Reichmann, Christoph Dösinger, Lorenz Romaner, David Holec</p>
            <p>The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</p>

            <p>The tunable band structure and nontrivial topology of multilayer rhombohedral graphene lead to a variety of correlated electronic states with isospin orders-meaning ordered states in the combined spin and valley degrees of freedom-dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Here, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene using a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device. We observe sharp magnetic phase transitions that indicate spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter-metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. We also show that the half-metal phase has a very small magnetic anisotropy, which provides an experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy. This is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies will allow a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingbo Wei</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.</p>

For high entry and exit rates of the cellular automaton, and with {sufficiently large} particle numbers, the DWs formed are independent of the associated rate parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality} in their {\em shapes}. In contrast, the DWs do depend upon these parameters, if they are small, and hence have nonuniversal shapes. Our predictions on the DWs are testable in experiments.</p>

            <p>The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</p>

            <p>Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</p>

We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.</p>

            <p>We use the computer algebra system GAP to classify modular data up to rank 12. This extends the previously obtained classification of modular data up to rank 6. Our classification includes all the modular data from modular tensor categories up to rank 12, with a few possible exceptions at rank 12 and levels $5,7$ and $14$. Those exceptions are eliminated up to a certain bound by an extensive finite search in place of required infinite search. Our list contains a few potential unitary modular data which are not known to correspond to any unitary modular tensor categories (such as those from Kac-Moody algebra, twisted quantum doubles of finite group, as well as their Abelian anyon condensations). It remains to be shown if those potential modular data can be realized by modular tensor categories or not. We provide some evidence that all may be constructed from centers of near-group categories or gauging group symmetries of known modular tensor categories, with the exception of a total of five cases at rank 11 (with $D^2 =1964.590$) and 12 (with $D^2 =3926.660$). The classification of modular data corresponds to a classification of modular tensor categories (up to modular isotopes which are not expected to be present at low ranks). The classification of modular tensor categories leads to a classification of gapped quantum phases of matter in 2-dimensional space for bosonic lattice systems with no symmetry, as well as a classification of generalized symmetries in 1-dimensional space.</p>

            <p>Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</p>

            <p>The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</p>

            <p>Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.</p>

            <h2>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Nguyen, David J. Schwab, Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn</p>
            <p>Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <h2>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Guo, Frank X. Lee</p>
            <p>The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirakjyoti Sarma, Nilakshi Das</p>
            <p>The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</p>

            <h2>Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhad Kamarei, Bo Zheng, John E. Dolbow, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</p>
            <p>Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan J. J. Connor, Callum W. Duncan, Andrew J. Daley</p>
            <p>The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of a dark soliton in a curved 1D Bose-Einstein condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge A. G. Attie, Emanuel A. L. Henn</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dark solitons in a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a curved geometry. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in curvilinear coordinates and a perturbative expansion in the local curvature, we derive a set of coupled evolution equations for the soliton velocity and the curvature. For the case of constant curvature, such as circular geometries, the soliton dynamics is governed solely by the initial velocity and curvature. Remarkably, the soliton travels a nearly constant angular trajectory across two orders of magnitude in curvature, suggesting an emergent conserved quantity, independent of its initial velocity. We extend our analysis to elliptical trajectories with spatially varying curvature and show that soliton dynamics remain determined by the local curvature profile. In these cases, the model of effective constant curvature describes accurately the dynamics given the local curvature has smooth variation. When the soliton crosses regions of rapid curvature variation and/or non-monotonic behavior, the model fails to describe to soliton dynamics, although the overall behavior can still be fully mapped to the curvature profile. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the role of geometry in soliton dynamics and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear excitations in curved quantum systems.</p>

We present theoretically a nondestructive, \textit{in situ} and real time protocol for observing the AC and DC Josephson effects including integer (recently observed in cold atoms) and fractional (hitherto unobserved in cold atoms) Shapiro steps, using a ring condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Our analysis presents a metrology standard that does not require measurmement of atomic number and that challenges the conventional wisdom that quantum computations cannot be observed without being destroyed.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Xiao Zhang, Naoto Nagaosa</p>
            <p>Optical effects of quantum matter with interaction are key to physics and technology. The class of non-Hermitian (NH) phenomena is mostly explored in cold atoms, photonics, and metamaterials out of equilibrium. Effective NH systems due to interaction in equilibrium solids, however, provide a unique opportunity for realizing light-NH matter hybrids via periodic irradiation. Given NH topological surface states with magnetic disorder, here we reveal spectroscopically observable Floquet spin textures for this hybrid quantum matter: merged meron strings, dichroic skyrmions, and domain structure accompanying vortices in energy planes; Bloch lines and topologically twisted vortex rings distinct from Hopfions in energy-momentum space; topological selectiveness of linear polarization occurs besides circular dichroism. Spectroscopic energy evolution and chemical potential dependence are key ingredients of this open hybrid system. With spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this scenario bears prime physical interest by reaching the crossroad between solid-state interaction effects, non-Hermiticity, and light-matter coupling.</p>

            <p>Most superconducting materials are well-understood and conventional in the sense that the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of $d$-wave symmetry. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ harbors nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional $i$-wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below $10\,\mathrm{K}$, the superconductivity in PtBi$_2$ gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, while its bulk states remain normal. The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the center of the Fermi arcs, and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This not only establishes PtBi$_2$ surfaces as unconventional, topological $i$-wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.</p>

            <p>Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields, suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis, motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.</p>

The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly non-linear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states</p>

            <p>Analog computers hold promise to significantly reduce the energy consumption of artificial intelligence algorithms, but commercialization has been hampered by a fundamental scientific challenge - how to reliably store and process analog information with high precision. We present an approach based upon metal oxide memory cells that undergo controlled self-heating during programming with a newly developed, electro-thermo-chemical gate. The gate uniformly spreads heat and electrochemical reactions to enable wide, bulk-vacancy modulation which yields nine orders of magnitude in tunable analog resistance - three orders greater than other devices reported, with thousands of states. The gating profoundly reduces noise and drift to enable precision programming to targeted states within a few operations, lowering conductance errors by two orders of magnitude relative to other devices reported. Simulations show improvement in computational energy efficiency by at least 10x over other devices due to far greater scalability at higher precision. The results overturn long-held assumptions about the poor reliability and precision of analog resistance devices and opens the door to manufacturable, bulk metal-oxide devices and new applications that leverage high precision.</p>

            <p>We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized measurements.</p>

            <h2>Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization length, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicates the situation leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of real-space topology in moiré systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kryštof Kolář, Kang Yang, Felix von Oppen, Christophe Mora</p>
            <p>The appearance of fractional Chern insulators in moiré systems can be rationalized by the presence of a fictitious magnetic field associated with the spatial texture of layer-resolved electronic wavefunctions. Here, we present a systematic study of real-space topology and the associated fictitious magnetic fields in moiré systems. We first show that at the level of individual Bloch wavefunctions, the real-space Chern number, akin to a Pontryagin index, is a fragile marker. It generically vanishes except for specific limits where the Bloch functions exhibit fine-tuned zeroes within the unit cell, such as the chiral limit of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) or the adiabatic regime of twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We then show that these limitations do not apply to textures associated with ensembles of Bloch wavefunctions, such as entire bands or the ensemble of states at a given energy. The Chern number of these textures defines a robust topological index protected by a spectral gap. We find that symmetries constrain it to be nonzero for both twisted TMDs and TBG across all twist angles and levels of corrugation, implying experimental signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We also study real-space topology within the topological heavy fermion model of TBG, finding that the real-space topological features are supported only by the light c-electrons.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore & Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Serrano Richaud, Sylvain Latil, Lorenzo Sponza</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We employ ab initio theories (DFT and the G0W0 method) as well as a tight-binding ladder model originally introduced to study the gapwidth of isolated nanoribbons. After investigating the charge distribution across the interface, we identify the nature of the states around the gap and scrutinize their evolution as a function of the characteristic dimensions of the system (the graphene ribbons' width N and the boron nitride ribbons' width L). We also disclose how the very interface between graphene and boron nitride changes the electronic properties of both materials with respect to the corresponding isolated nanoribbons. Finally we discuss the light absorption properties of these systems by deriving specific selection rules for the heterostructures and calculating spectra from first principles in the independent particle and the random phase approximations</p>

            <p>Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.</p>

            <p>We study ultrafast photocurrents in thin films of a model ferromagnetic metal with broken bulk inversion symmetry, the half-metallic Heusler compound NiMnSb, following excitation with an optical pump pulse with photon energy 1.55 eV. Remarkably, in terms of the direction of the sample magnetization M, all photocurrents are found to be a superposition of a component with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type symmetry. We explain the Dresselhaus bulk photocurrent as follows: Pump-induced electron heating induces an excess of spin {\mu}_s||M, which transfers spin angular momentum into states with Dresselhaus-type spin-momentum locking. The resulting charge current relaxes on a time scale of 10 fs by momentum relaxation and, thus, follows {\mu}_s quasi-instantaneously. The relaxation of {\mu}_s is governed by the cooling of the electrons and not by the significantly slower spin-lattice relaxation of half-metals. Our findings add the Dresselhaus spin-galvanic effect (SGE) to the set of ultrafast spin-charge-conversion phenomena. They indicate a route to more efficient spintronic terahertz emitters and detectors based on the volume scaling of the bulk SGE.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingwei Chen, Junyi Ji, Liangliang Hong, Xiangang Wan, Hongjun Xiang</p>
            <p>The generation of pure spin currents is critical for low-dissipation spintronic applications, yet existing methods relying on spin-orbit coupling or ferromagnetic interfaces face challenges in material compatibility and operational robustness. We propose a paradigm-shifting approach to generate symmetry-protected pure spin currents by applying mechanical stress on insulating antiferromagnetic materials, i.e., the pure piezospintronic effect. We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr2O3 and NaMnX (X=As, Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect. Our study not only provides first-principles approach for investigating spin dipole moment related phenomena (e.g., ferrotoroidicity, fractional quantum spin dipole moment, piezospintronics), but also provide promising piezospintronic materials for experimental verification and industrial applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

            <p>Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.</p>

            <p>The coupling of ferroelectricity and magnetic order provides rich tunability for engineering material properties and demonstrates great potential for uncovering novel quantum phenomena and multifunctional devices. Here, we report interfacial ferroelectricity in moiré superlattices constructed from graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. We observe ferroelectric polarization in an across-layer moiré superlattice with an intercalated layer, demonstrating a remnant polarization comparable to its non-intercalated counterpart. Remarkably, we reveal a magnetic-field enhancement of ferroelectric polarization that persists up to room temperature, showcasing an unconventional amplification of ferroelectricity in materials lacking magnetic elements. This phenomenon, consistent across devices with varying layer configurations, arises purely from electronic rather than ionic contributions. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in turn modulates quantum transport characteristics, suppressing Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and altering quantum Hall states in polarized phases. This interplay between ferroelectricity and magneto-transport in non-magnetic materials is crucial for exploring magnetoelectric effects and advancing two-dimensional memory and logic applications.</p>

            <p>Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model, which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Static disorder-induced renormalization of polariton group velocity</h2>

            <p>Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Exciton Drift Velocity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinlyu Cao, H.A.Fertig, Luis Brey</p>
            <p>We show that the dipole moment of an exciton is uniquely determined by the quantum geometry of its eigenstates, and demonstrate its intimate connection with a quantity we call the Quantum Geometric Dipole (QGD). The QGD arises naturally in semiclassical dynamics of an exciton in an electric field, contributing to the anomalous velocity differently from the Berry's curvature. In a uniform electric field QGD results in a drift velocity akin to that expected for excitons in crossed electric and magnetic fields, even in the absence of a real magnetic field. We compute the quantities relevant to semiclassical exciton dynamics for several interesting examples of bilayer systems with weak interlayer tunneling and Fermi energy in a gap, where the exciton may be sensibly described as a two-body problem. These quantities include the exciton dispersion, its QGD, and Berry's curvature. For two gapped-graphene layers in a vanishing magnetic field, we find the Quantum Geometric Dipole vanishes if the layers are identical, but may be non-zero when the layers differ. We further analyze examples in the presence of magnetic fields, allowing us to examine cases involving graphene, in which a gap is opened by Landau level splitting. Heterostructures involving TMDs are also considered. In each case the Quantum Geometric Dipole and Berry's curvatures play out differently. In some cases, the lowest energy exciton state is found to reside at finite momentum, with interesting possibilities for Bose condensation. We also find situations in which the QGD increases monotonically with exciton momentum, suggesting that the quantum geometry can be exploited to produce photocurrents from initially bound excitons with electric fields. We speculate on further possible effects of the semiclassical dynamics in geometries where the constituent layers are subject to the same or different electric fields.</p>

            <p>Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In our work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</p>

The implantation process maintains strong coupling and provides lithographic ($ < 300 ~ \mathrm{nm}$) resolution.

            <p>Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) classifies the topological phases by real-space invariants in which obstructed atomic insulators belong to the trivial case but sometimes show the feature of higher-order topological insulator. Here, for a two-dimensional magnetic photonic obstructed atomic insulator, we show that the emergence of corner states is associated with the Wyckoff positions. In such a square lattice with four +$M$ elements and four -$M$ elements, corner states appear when the superlattice exposes $2b$ Wyckoff positions. And the corner states will decrease when the number of exposed $2b$ Wyckoff positions decreases and disappears when $2b$ Wyckoff positions no longer stand at the edge. By arranging all the magnetic rods into one magnetization direction, we find that time-reversal symmetry is not important for corner states. Our finding indicates that the real-space distribution of atoms determines the feature of higher-order topological insulators for obstructed atomic insulators in TQC.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems (i.e., the parameters of the system lie on the boundary of the stability conditions). We analytically examine two distinct critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude. Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.</p>

            <p>Thermalization processes degrade the states of any working medium, turning any initial state into a passive state from which no work can be extracted. Recently, it has been shown that this degradation can be avoided if two identical thermalization processes take place in coherently controlled order, in a scenario known as the quantum SWITCH. In some situations, control over the order even enables work extraction when the medium was initially in a passive state. This activation phenomenon, however, is subject to a limitation: to extract non-zero work, the initial temperature of the medium should be less than half of the temperature of the reservoirs. Here we analyze this limitation, showing that it still holds true even when the medium interacts with $N\ge 2$ reservoirs in a coherently-controlled order. Then, we show that the limitation can be lifted when the medium and the control systems are initially correlated. In particular, when the medium and control are entangled, work extraction becomes possible for every initial value of the local temperature of the medium.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. Here, we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.</p>

            <p>We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. This orbital preponderance macroscopically manifests itself in the sign inversion of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter, and can be tested experimentally as the flip of the angular momentum polarization of magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</p>

            <p>We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</p>

            <h2>Phase transitions due to Euclidean gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Saeed, Diya Batool, Muhammad Muzammil, Nomaan X</p>
            <p>We use Ising-like models to probe the thermal nature of Euclidean spacetime backgrounds. We determine which properties of the background -- curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature -- play a role in phase transitions. The geometries we use are Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS). Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature -- or Euclidean gravity -- increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature. Separately, since the selected geometries are position-dependent, the Ising-like models constructed on them are inhomogeneous, whereby they generalize the standard Ising model. We find that a consequence of this is that criticality does not correspond to maximal correlation lengths and scale invariance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehran Z-Abyaneh, Mehrdad Farhoudi, Mahdi Mashkoori</p>
            <p>We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</p>

            <h2>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Jie Huang, Yanzhu Chen</p>
            <p>In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code transformation to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state encoded in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ surface code. A logical $T$ gate can be implemented in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code by gate teleportation. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding transformations between topological codes.</p>

This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha<1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</p>

            <h2>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xikun Li, Tomasz Sowiński</p>
            <p>When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.</p>

We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor Jahnke, Pratik Nandy, Kuntal Pal, Hugo A. Camargo, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</p>

            <p>In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)<1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}<\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.</p>

            <p>We observe the interlayer A1s^I, A2s^I, and B1s^I excitons in bilayer WSe2 under applied electric fields using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Remarkably, these interlayer excitons remain optically bright despite being well separated from symmetry-matched intralayer excitons-a regime where conventional two-level coupling models fail unless unphysically large coupling strengths are assumed. To uncover the origin of this brightening, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations and find that the applied electric field distorts the valence-band Bloch states, driving the hole wavefunction from one layer to the other. This field-driven interlayer hole transfer imparts intralayer character to the interlayer excitons, thereby enhancing their oscillator strength without requiring hybridization with bright intralayer states. Simulations confirm that this mechanism accounts for the major contribution to the observed brightness, with excitonic hybridization playing only a minor role. Our results identify interlayer hole transfer as a robust and general mechanism for brightening interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially when inter- and intralayer excitons are energetically well separated.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of the exciton binding energy and reduced effective mass in halide perovskites is of utmost importance for the selective design of optoelectronic devices. Although these properties are currently determined by several spectroscopic techniques, complementary theoretical models are often required to bridge macroscopic and microscopic properties. Here, we present a novel method to determine these quantities while fully accounting for polarization effects due to carrier interactions with longitudinal optical phonons. Our approach estimates the exciton-polaron binding energy from optical absorption measurements using a recently developed Elliott based Band Fluctuations model. The reduced effective mass is obtained via the Pollmann-Buttner exciton-polaron model, which is based on the Frohlich polaron framework, where the strength of the electron-phonon interaction arises from changes in the dielectric properties. The procedure is applied to the family of perovskites ABX3 (A = MA, FA, Cs; B = Pb; X = I, Br, Cl), showing excellent agreement with high field magnetoabsorption and other optical-resolved techniques. The results suggest that the Pollmann-Buttner model offers a robust and novel approach for determining the reduced effective mass in metal tri-halide perovskites and other polar materials exhibiting free exciton bands.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.</p>

            <p>The ability to finely tune optoelectronic properties in semiconductors is crucial for the development of advanced technologies, ranging from photodetectors to photovoltaics. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to achieve such tunability by utilizing electric fields to excite low-energy polar optical phonon modes, which strongly couple to electronic states in anharmonic semiconductors. We conducted a high-throughput screening of over $10,000$ materials, focusing on centrosymmetric compounds with imaginary polar phonon modes and suitable band gaps, and identified $310$ promising candidates with potential for enhanced optoelectronic tunability. From this set, three perovskite-like compounds --Ag$_3$SBr, BaTiO$_3$, and PbHfO$_3$-- were selected for in-depth investigation based on their contrasting band-gap behavior with temperature. Using first-principles calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations, tight-binding models, and anharmonic Fröhlich theory, we analyzed the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results show that polar phonon distortions can induce substantial band-gap modulations at ambient conditions, including reductions of up to $70\%$ in Ag$_3$SBr and increases of nearly $23\%$ in BaTiO$_3$, relative to values calculated at zero temperature, while PbHfO$_3$ exhibits minimal change. These contrasting responses arise from distinct electron-phonon coupling mechanisms and orbital hybridization at the band edges. This work establishes key design principles for harnessing polar lattice dynamics to engineer tunable optoelectronic properties, paving the way for adaptive technologies such as wavelength-selective optical devices and solar absorbers.</p>

            <p>Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</p>

These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system.

We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p>

            <p>The superconducting phase of doped 1T-TiSe$_2$ is a fruitful playground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the anomalous metal state and spontaneously formed superconducting network. Here, we address these emergent states by studying the superconducting gap of lithium intercalated TiSe$_2$-a fundamental quantity that has remained unexplored so far. We fabricate a device that combines solid-state lateral lithium intercalation, resistance measurements and tunneling spectroscopy. We successfully probe the superconducting gap of TiSe$_2$ and reveal that the gap closing temperature well exceeds the transition temperature ($T_c$) expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, indicating pronounced superconducting fluctuations even in a bulk-like system. Moreover, the symmetric gap persists even in the anomalous metal state, demonstrating the particle-hole symmetry of this exotic phase directly from the density of states. Finally, the superconducting gap shows magneto-oscillations with higher harmonics, attesting to a rather regular structure of the intrinsic superconducting network.</p>

            <h2>Density functional theory study of effect of NO annealing on electronic structures and carrier scattering properties of 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nahoto Funaki, Kosei Sugiyama, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Half-metallicity and anomalous Slater-Pauling behaviour in half-Heusler CrMnSb</h2>

            <p>This study provides a first-principles insight into half-Heusler CrMnSb to understand its deviation from the conventional Slater-Pauling semiconducting behavior. CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.</p>

            <h2>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki</p>
            <p>The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p>

            <h2>Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c=H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis obtained with the Curie-Weiss model. Our work provides a panoramic view of the finite-time evolution of the stochastic $\phi^4$ model, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Malosso, Edward Danquah Donkor, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali</p>
            <p>A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Gustin, Chang Woo Kim, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</p>

            <h2>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</p>

            <p>Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.</p>

            <p>Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</p>

            <p>Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</p>

            <p>Ab initio thermodynamics is a widespread, computationally efficient approach to predict the stable configuration of a surface in contact with a surrounding (gas or liquid) environment. In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.</p>

Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</p>

            <p>Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.</p>

            <p>We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points, which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.</p>

Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Jnane, Simon C Benjamin</p>
            <p>Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modelling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. We determine full, 3D solutions and introduce a method which can obtain near-identical predictions using far more efficient 2D computations. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.</p>

            <p>Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</p>

            <p>In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the Néel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, Nathan Goldman</p>
            <p>The Středa formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</p>

            <p>We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</p>

            <p>In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Nonlocal devices, comprising heavy-metal nanowires on magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), enable angular momentum transport via magnons. These magnons are polarized by spin accumulation at the interface through the spin Hall effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). The processes are generally reciprocal, as demonstrated by comparable efficiencies when reversing injector and detector roles. However, introducing Ru, which enables the orbital Hall effect (OHE), disrupts this reciprocity. In our system, magnons polarized through combined SHE and OHE and detected via iSHE are 35% more efficient than the reverse process. We attribute this nonreciprocity to nonzero spin vorticity, resulting from varying electron drift velocities across the Pt/Ru interface. This study highlights the potential of orbital transport mechanisms in influencing angular momentum transport and efficiency in nonlocal spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wyatt Kirkby, Hayder Salman, Thomas Gasenzer, Lauriane Chomaz</p>
            <p>We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation after crossing the critical point. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak</p>
            <p>It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Zi Huang, Philipp Fabritius, Jeffrey Mohan, Mohsen Talebi, Simon Wili, Tilman Esslinger</p>
            <p>Fermionic superfluid junctions typically exhibit suppressed thermal and spin transport due to the presence of a pairing gap but allow coherent particle transport. While dissipation generally weakens coherent transport, it can also induce excitations that open other transport channels. In this work, we experimentally study a one-dimensional superfluid junction of strongly interacting fermions with local particle loss and observe dissipation-induced thermal and spin transport that appear to saturate at strong dissipation. Notably, in this regime, the measured thermal and spin conductances are comparable to the universal quantized conductance of one-dimensional ideal Fermi gas. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed for two dissipation mechanisms, either spin-imbalanced or pairwise losses. Our findings provide new insights into transport in interacting open quantum systems and suggest possibilities of dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</p>

            <p>Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, more physical insight is needed before we can take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanostructures with complex form and function. Here we show how a significant part of this design space can be quickly and comprehensively understood by identifying a class of thermodynamic constraints that act on it. These thermodynamic constraints form a high-dimensional convex polyhedron that determines which nanostructures can be assembled at high equilibrium yield and reveals limitations that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of the polyhedral structure and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover fundamental physical relationships underpinning many-component programmable self-assembly in equilibrium and form the basis for robust inverse-design, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.</p>

Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</p>

We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements.

            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</p>

Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</p>

            <p>Flexoelectricity, polarization induced by strain gradients, is especially pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to mechanical deformation. In nanostructures with sub-nm curvature, this effect is governed by quantum-mechanical polarization and electrostatic modulation, not merely classical lattice distortion. Here, we present the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting polarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed those of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude. These nanowrinkles, with sub-nm radii of curvature at their apex, undergo atomic-level buckling and result in localized strain fields, as confirmed by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy. These curvatures create an asymmetry to {\pi}-orbital interactions across the atomic layer, which, in turn, leads to localized polarization densities. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals curvature-dependent work function shifts consistent with flexoelectric polarization, while conductive atomic force microscopy detects reproducible flexoelectric currents exhibiting a threshold voltage ({\Phi}th ~1 V) that matches the band offset predicted by ab initio calculations (~1.2 V). Together, these results confirm how flexoelectric dipoles reshape the local electronic potential. Graphene nanowrinkles thus provide a pristine platform for uncovering quantum-mechanical flexoelectricity: a fundamentally ubiquitous effect, whose study in the simplest crystalline material can illuminate electromechanical behavior across condensed matter, soft matter, and biological systems.</p>

            <p>Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.</p>

            <p>Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</p>

            <h2>Extended Structural Dynamics -- Emergent Irreversibility from Reversible Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick BarAvi</p>
            <p>The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are constrained to dilute gases and short timescales. In this work, we introduce Extended Structural Dynamics (ESD), a deterministic framework in which irreversibility arises from the internal geometry of structured particles. In ESD, particles possess finite size and internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, that are dynamically coupled to translational motion. This coupling induces instability, nonlinear feedback, and chaotic mixing in the extended phase space, even under time-reversal symmetric laws. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible volume of phase space, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) form measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times scaling as Trec. These results address the Loschmidt and Zermelo paradoxes without coarse-graining, randomness, or fine-tuning. We further extend the model to charged systems (cESD), where long-range electromagnetic interactions drive continuous structural coupling. ESD thus provides a deterministic and testable mechanism for emergent thermodynamic behavior, with applications ranging from mesoscopic systems to the cosmological arrow of time.</p>

            <h2>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Mera Acosta</p>
            <p>We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mu_{\text{B}}(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic (altermagnetic), linear (spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in our recently developed MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. The enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed by analyzing the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and the stability of Li-ion in Ti-doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</p>

In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky</p>
            <p>We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</p>

We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of Rényi entropies.</p>

            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

Ni shows a strong modification of the scattering pattern, approximately 10 to 40 times stronger than Co. As distortions of the labyrinthine pattern in reciprocal space relate to the modification of domain textures in real space, significant differences in Co and Ni highlight a 3D distortion of the domain pattern in the far-from-equilibrium regime.</p>

            <p>The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Atanasov, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>From benign overfitting in overparameterized models to rich power-law scalings in performance, simple ridge regression displays surprising behaviors sometimes thought to be limited to deep neural networks. This balance of phenomenological richness with analytical tractability makes ridge regression the model system of choice in high-dimensional machine learning. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on recent results on ridge regression using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. We highlight the fact that statistical fluctuations in empirical covariance matrices can be absorbed into a renormalization of the ridge parameter. This `deterministic equivalence' allows us to obtain analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors in a few lines of algebra by leveraging the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. From these precise asymptotics, we can easily identify sources of power-law scaling in model performance. In all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. This allows us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</p>

            <h2>Bacteria optimize tumble bias to strategically navigate surface constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antai Tao, Guangzhe Liu, Rongjing Zhang, Junhua Yuan</p>
            <p>In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (~ 0.25). Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gionni Marchetti</p>
            <p>A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p>

We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Colmenarez, Seyong Kim, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50 percent threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50 percent threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</p>

            <p>The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</p>

However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities.

In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$ 1.2 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.</p>

However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</p>

            <p>We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic approach to the quantized light-matter interaction in semiconductor nanostructures: Complex coupled dynamics of excitons, biexcitons, and photons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendrik Rose, Stefan Schumacher, Torsten Meier</p>
            <p>We present a microscopic and fully quantized model to investigate the interaction between semiconductor nanostructures and quantum light fields including the many-body Coloumb interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes. Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states. Our findings emphasize the importance of a comprehensive microscopic modeling in order to accurately describe quantum optical phenomena of interacting electronic many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.</p>

            <p>The interaction between the electronic and structural degrees of freedom is central to several intriguing phenomena observed in condensed-matter physics. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom, resulting in magnetoelastic coupling, which is typically small and only detectable in macroscopic samples. Here we demonstrate a giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish an effective control of magnetism in the surface layer and utilize it to probe the impact of magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We further determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, which exhibits giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, revealing how electronic correlations result in a strong electron-lattice coupling.</p>

            <h2>Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)</h2>

            <p>Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</p>

            <h2>Quantized Chern-Simons Axion Coupling in Anomalous Floquet Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Nathan Goldman, Gonzalo Usaj</p>
            <p>Quantized bulk response functions are hallmark signatures of topological phases, but their manifestation in periodically driven (Floquet) systems is not yet fully established. Here, we show that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems exhibit a quantized bulk response encoded in a Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling angle, reflecting a topological magnetoelectric effect analogous to that in three-dimensional insulators. The periodic drive introduces an emergent "photon" dimension, allowing the system to be viewed as a three-dimensional Sambe lattice. Within this framework, cross-correlated responses such as photon-space polarization and magnetization density, emerge as physical signatures of the CSA coupling. The CSA angle, constructed from the non-Abelian Berry connection of Floquet states, admits a natural interpretation in terms of the geometry of hybrid Wannier states. These results provide a unified framework linking Floquet band topology to quantized bulk observables.</p>

Such models are relevant, e.g. for spin-valley locked moiré transition metal dichalcogenides. The opposite Chern number of the two spins hinders the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet, instead favouring other phases. We study the phase diagram in dependence on different short-range Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$ and uncover several phases: A fractional topological insulator, a phase separated state, a spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall state, and the partially particle-hole transformed Halperin (111) state. The effect of the pseudopotentials $V_m$ depends on the parity of $m$, the relative angular momentum.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectrics (TEs) are solid-state devices that can realize heat-electricity conversion. Transverse TEs require materials with a large Nernst effect, which typically requires a strong applied magnetic field. However, topological materials with magnetic order offer an alternative pathway for achieving large Nernst via the anomalous Hall effect and the accompanying anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) that arise from band topology. Here, we show that YbMnBi2 with a low Hall density and a chemical potential near the Weyl points has, to the best of our knowledge, the highest ANE-dominated Nernst thermopower of any magnetic material, with $S_{yx}$ around 110 $\mu$V/K ($T$ = 254 K, 5 T < $|\mu_0 H|$ < 9 T applied along the spin canting direction), due to the synergism between classical contributions from filled electron bands, large Hall conductivity of topological origin, and large resistivity anisotropy. An appreciable thermal Hall angle of $0.02 < (\nabla_y T)/(\nabla_x T) < 0.06$ was observed (40 K < $T$ < 310 K, $\mu_0 H$ = 9 T).</p>

            <h2>The Interacting Energy Bands of Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene Revealed by the Quantum Twisting Microscope</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Xiao, A. Inbar, J. Birkbeck, N. Gershon, Y. Zamir, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, E. Berg, S. Ilani</p>
            <p>Electron interactions in quantum materials fundamentally shape their energy bands and, with them, the material's most intriguing quantum phases. Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands. More broadly, our results establish the QTM as a powerful tool for high-resolution spectroscopic studies of quantum materials previously inaccessible to conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of homogeneous ultracold Bose gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules following a sudden quench of the scattering length at zero temperature. We calculate in particular the quantum depletion, the anomalous density, the condensate fluctuations, and the pair correlation function using both the time-dependent Bogoliubov approach and the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. During their time evolution, these quantities exhibit slow or fast oscillations depending on the strength of the shielding interactions. We find that at long time scales the molecular condensate is characterized by nonequilibrium steady-state momentum distribution functions, with depletion, anomalous density and correlations that deviate from their corresponding equilibrium values. We demonstrate that the pair correlations expand diffusively at short times while they spread ballistically at long times.</p>

            <h2>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchang Cai, Rui-Xing Zhang</p>
            <p>Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single photon emission (SPE) from atomic defects, primarily tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to yield high purity, deterministically positioned SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T<30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (>90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T=90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in a layered WSe2/graphite heterostructure maintains high purity up to T=90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T=115 K. This method preserves the best qualities of SPE from WSe2 while increasing working temperature to more than three times the typical range. This work demonstrates the versatility of surface functionalization and heterostructure design to synergistically improve the properties of quantum emission and offers new insights into the phenomenon of SPE from 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Eu metal and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, which leads to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu adlayer leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state is quasi-two-dimensional, as evidenced by the angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage characteristics. An in-plane upper critical field B$_{c2}$ significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit is observed, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity. The strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high-T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.</p>

The physical origin lies in the reorientation of the easy axis of magnetic anisotropy, triggered by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. We show that the transition operates effectively under both static and dynamic conditions, exhibiting remarkable stability and flexibility. Notably, this transition can be achieved entirely through electric control, without requiring any external magnetic field. Furthermore, we propose a binary encoding scheme based on the skyrmion-bimeron transition, presenting a promising path toward energy-efficient spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Ryuichi Shindou</p>
            <p>Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</p>

Hourglass fermions are of interest in spintronics due to their unique and robust band structure, as well as their potential applications in novel electronic devices.

Through symmetry analysis, we explore the band crossings and spin textures along specific high-symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone. Our results reveal a fascinating hourglass-shaped band dispersion and spin polarisation governed by symmetry operations and spin-orbit interaction. We analyse the spin-splitting mechanisms, including Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, and suggest potential applications for spin-based devices.

In the case of the Fe-containing junctions, two distinct oxidation states are present.

            <p>We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.</p>

            <p>For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.</p>

            <p>Recent studies on cavity-coupled two-dimensional electron gas demonstrate that vacuum-field engineering can tailor electronic transport properties of materials. By achieving ultra-strong coupling between a terahertz resonator and mesoscopic graphene, we demonstrate that cavity vacuum fields can alter the effective degeneracies of Landau levels, resulting in a nonlinear Landau fan diagram for massless Dirac fermions while preserving quantum-Hall quantization. Specifically, by leveraging graphene's gate-tunability, we observe that quantum-Hall features, minimum longitudinal and quantized Hall conductance for a given filling factor, occur at carrier densities reduced by more than 20 percent compared to systems without cavity. Theoretical analysis attributes this effect to the virtual cavity photon mediated transitions between the non-equidistant Landau levels in graphene, significantly reducing their effective degeneracy. This study paves the way for investigating cavity quantum electrodynamics in highly tunable, atomically thin two-dimensional crystals.</p>

            <p>One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshali Mitra, Sukrut Mondkar, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Alexander Soloviev</p>
            <p>Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature. We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Variational simulation of quantum phase transitions induced by boundary fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan C. Duriez, Andreia Saguia, Marcelo S. Sarandy</p>
            <p>The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.</p>

            <h2>Mirror-mediated long-range coupling and robust phase locking of spatially separated exciton-polariton condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuang Liang, Hassan Alnatah, Qi Yao, Jonathan Beaumariage, Ken West, Kirk Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Natalia G. Berloff, David W. Snoke</p>
            <p>Lattice arrays have been shown to have great value as simulators for complicated mathematical problems. In all physical lattices so far, coupling is only between nearest neighbors or nearest plus next-nearest neighbors; the geometry of the lattice controls the couplings of the sites. Realizing independently tunable, long-range interactions between distant condensates is a prerequisite for scalable analogue spin machines but has so far been restricted to short-range geometric coupling. In this work we show that it is possible using two-dimensional lattices of polariton condensates to use the third dimension to arbitrarily select two sites to couple coherently. Light emitted in the vertical direction from a condensate at one site can be imaged and sent back into the system to impinge on a different condensate at an arbitrary distance. We demonstrate this for the case of two condensates, in which we first ensure that they have no coupling within the plane of the lattice, and then use external imaging to phase lock the two together. Phase-resolved interferometry confirms clearly visible interference fringes and deterministic phase locking even when direct, planar coupling is suppressed. Analytical modeling reveals complementary mechanisms underpinning the robust coherence. Because the mirror adds no cameras, modulators, or electronic processing, the condensate pair operates as a pure, high-bandwidth analog element. Extension to dense graphs via segmented micro-mirror arrays is therefore ultimately limited only by the field of view and numerical aperture of the imaging optics. Our scheme thus paves the way to reconfigurable, energy-efficient polaritonic hardware for optimization, classification, clustering, and other neuromorphic tasks at the speed of light.</p>

            <h2>Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan V Fyodorov</p>
            <p>We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) of non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The method, which represents an alternative to Girko Hermitization approach, is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to consider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we discuss the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a possible generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.</p>

            <p>Gem-dicarbonyls of transition metals supported on metal (oxide) surfaces are common intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis. While infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a standard tool for detecting these species on applied catalysts, the ill-defined crystallographic environment of species observed on powder catalysts renders data interpretation challenging. In this work, we apply a multi-technique surface science approach to investigate rhodium gem-dicarbonyls on a single-crystalline rutile TiO$_2$(110) surface. We combine spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to determine their location and coordination on the surface. IR spectroscopy shows the successful creation of gem-dicarbonyls on a titania single crystal by exposing deposited Rh atoms to CO gas, followed by annealing to 200-250 K. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) data reveal that these complexes are mostly aligned along the [001] crystallographic direction, corroborating theoretical predictions. Notably, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data reveal multiple rhodium species on the surface, even when the IR spectra show only the signature of rhodium gem-dicarbonyls. As such, our results highlight the complex behavior of carbonyls on metal oxide surfaces, and demonstrate the necessity of multi-technique approaches for the adequate characterization of single-atom catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Anharmonic phonons via quantum thermal bath simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taylor Baird, Rodolphe Vuilleumier, Sara Bonella</p>
            <p>Lattice vibrations within crystalline solids, or phonons, provide information on a variety of important material characteristics, from thermal qualities to optical properties and phase transition behaviour. When the material contains light ions, or is subjected to sufficiently low temperatures and/or high pressures, anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) may significantly alter its phonon characteristics. Unfortunately, accurate inclusion of these two effects within numerical simulations typically incurs a substantial computational cost. In this work, we present a novel approach which promises to mitigate this problem. The scheme leverages the recently introduced quantum correlators approach for the extraction of anharmonic phonon frequencies from molecular dynamics data. To account for NQEs without excessive increase of the computational cost, we include nuclear quantum effects via the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method. This is the first full exploration of the use of QTB for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations. We demonstrate the noteworthy efficiency and accuracy of the scheme, and analyze its upsides and drawbacks by first considering 1-dimensional systems, and then the physically interesting case of solid neon.</p>

            <h2>Ambiguities, Built-in Biases and Flaws in Big Data Insight Extraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Serge Galam</p>
            <p>I address the challenge of extracting reliable insights from large datasets using a simplified model that illustrates how hierarchical classification can distort outcomes. The model consists of discrete pixels labeled red, blue, or white. Red and blue indicate distinct properties, and white represents unclassified or ambiguous data. A macro-color is assigned only if one color holds a strict majority among the pixels. Otherwise, the aggregate is labeled white, reflecting uncertainty. This setup mimics a percolation threshold at fifty percent. Assuming direct access of the various proportions of colors is infeasible from the data, I implement a hierarchical coarse-graining procedure. Elements (first pixels, then aggregates) are recursively grouped and reclassified via local majority rules, producing ultimately a single super-aggregate whose color represents the inferred macro-property of the collection of pixels as a whole. Analytical results, supported by simulations, show that the process introduces additional white aggregates beyond white pixels, which could be initially present. These arise from groups lacking a clear majority, requiring arbitrary symmetry-breaking decisions to attribute a color to them. While each local resolution may appear minor and inconsequential, their repetitions introduce a growing systematic bias. Even with complete data, unavoidable asymmetries in local rules are shown to skew outcomes. This study highlights a critical limitation of recursive data reduction. Insight extraction is shaped not only by data quality, but by how local ambiguity is handled. That results in built-in biases. Thus, the related flaws are not due to the data, but due to structural choices made during local aggregations. Though based on a simple model, the findings expose the high likelihood of inherent flaws in widely used hierarchical classification techniques.</p>

            <p>Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics, chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition. Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Sabri Elatresh, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent studies on topologically non-trivial moiré bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study MoTe$_2$ bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering an untwisted bilayer system with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data were then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then apply our model to a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers - here, we assume rigid layers, which is a crucial simplification. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</p>

Motivated by a recent experiment [Yue et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 094511 (2024)], we discuss if and how the presence of vortex MZMs is reflected in supercurrent measurements, showing that Fraunhofer signatures alone are not suitable to reliably detect vortex MZMs. Next, we propose two ways in which we believe supercurrent measurements could be complemented to further verify that the junction does indeed host MZMs. Explicitly, we discuss how additional Majorana signatures could be obtained by (1) mapping out the local density of states in the junction via scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, and (2) microwave spectroscopy of the spectrum of low-energy CdGM states in the junction.</p>

            <p>A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</p>

            <p>The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</p>

            <p>We study nonreciprocal signatures of Josephson current (JC) in a quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction (JJ) that comprises of two periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs) coupled with an intervening QD. The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.</p>

Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis.

            <p>Advancements in materials design and manufacturing have allowed for the production of ordered and disordered metamaterials with diverse and novel properties. Hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials, which anomalously suppress density fluctuations on large length scales compared to typical disordered systems, and network materials are two classes of metamaterial that have desirable physical properties. Recent focus has been placed on the design of disordered hyperuniform network metamaterials that inherit the desirable properties of both of these metamaterial classes. In this work, we focus on determining the extent to which network structures derived from the spatial tessellations of hyperuniform point patterns inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point patterns. In particular, we examine the Delaunay, Voronoi, Delaunay-Centroidal, and Gabriel tessellations of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform point patterns in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space. We use the spectral density to characterize the density fluctuations of two-phase media created by thickening the edges of these tessellations in two dimensions and introduce a novel variance-based metric to characterize the network structures directly in two and three dimensions. We find that, while none of the tessellations completely inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point pattern, the degree to which the hyperuniformity is inherited is sensitive to the tessellation scheme and the short- and long-range translational disorder in the point pattern, but not to the choice of beam shape when mapping the networks into two-phase media.</p>

A quadrupole order parameter that emerges below $T_0=12$ K acts as a weak symmetry-breaking field on the antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N}=9.4$ K, leading to two-stage magnetic transitions. In the higher-temperature antiferromagnetic phase within the range $T_{\rm s2}=8~{\rm K}<T<T_{\rm N}$, an out-of-plane component of the antiferromagnetic moment may or may not be present. If present, magnetic fields applied along the [100] and [110] directions induce additional magnetic phases.</p>

            <p>When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</p>

            <h2>A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Hahn</p>
            <p>Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional PDMPs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michiya Chazono, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>Finite-momentum superconductivity has become an important research topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is stabi lized in atomically thin films by the orbital effect of an external magnetic field, has been getting attention as a fascinating finite-momentum superconducting state recently. We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</h2>

            <p>Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nilachal Chakrabarti, Neha Nirbhan, Arpan Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</p>

            <p>Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein</p>
            <p>Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Papaj, Lingyuan Kong, Stevan Nadj-Perge, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Pair density modulation is a superconducting state, recently observed in exfoliated iron-based superconductor flakes, in which the superconducting gap oscillates strongly with the same periodicity as the underlying crystalline lattice. We propose a microscopic model that explains this modulation through a combination of glide-mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of nematic superconductivity. The first ingredient results in a sublattice texture on the Fermi surface, which is aligned with the anisotropic superconducting gap of the nematic $s_\pm+d$ state. This gives rise to distinctive gap maxima and minima located on the two inequivalent iron sublattices while still being a zero-momentum pairing state. We discuss how further investigation of such modulations can give insight into the nature of the superconducting pairing, such as the signs of the order parameters and visualization of a phase transition to a mixed two-component state using local probes.</p>

            <p>The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</p>

            <h2>Boron Fullerenes: From Theoretical Predictions to Experimental Reality</h2>

            <p>We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = a/n^b + E_c^{sheet}$ (with $b \approx 1$) captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi_3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO-LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$ eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14 eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3 \, \mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dot energy levels in bilayer graphene: Exact and approximate study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Giavaras</p>
            <p>In bilayer graphene the exact energy levels of quantum dots can be derived from the four-component continuum Hamiltonian. Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schrödinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.</p>

Recently, we reported a family of transition metal sulfides MSene (M2S) with rich properties [Phys. Rev. B 111, L041404 (2025)], it is worth studying whether selenides with similar structure also have rich properties. In this work, through high-throughput screening, we present a novel family of 2D transition metal selenides, M2Se. In this family, there are fifty-eight candidate materials, of which ten are stable and metallic. Notably, eight exhibit superconductivity, among which four are superconducting topological metals. Besides, eight show charge density wave (CDW) behavior, among which five also exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is revealed that CDW originates from electron-phonon coupling rather than Fermi surface nesting. Moreover, strain can be applied to regulate the competition between CDW and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the rich properties of superconductivity, band topology, CDW, and magnetism in M2Se, providing a new platform for the controllable integration of multifunctional quantum states.</p>

            <p>The crystallization of charge carriers, dubbed the Wigner crystal, is anticipated at low densities in clean two-dimensional electronic systems (2DES). While there has been extensive investigation across diverse platforms, probing spontaneous charge and spin ordering is hindered by disorder effects and limited interaction energies. Here, we report transport evidence for Wigner crystals with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in high-quality, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated monolayer MoTe2, a system that achieves a large interaction parameter (r_s) at proper hole densities. A density-tuned metal-insulator transition (MIT) occurring at 3.1E10^11 cm-2 (corresponding to r_s~32) and pronounced nonlinear charge transport in the insulating regime at low temperatures signify the formation of Wigner crystals. Thermal melting of the crystalline phase is observed below approximately 2 K via temperature-dependent nonlinear transport. Magnetoresistance measurements further reveal a substantial enhancement of spin susceptibility as approaching the MIT. The temperature dependence of spin susceptibility in the Wigner crystal phase closely follows the Curie-Weiss law, with the extracted negative Weiss constant illustrating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, we have found the system exhibits metallic-like differential resistivity under finite DC bias, possibly indicating the existence of a non-equilibrium coherent state in the depinning of Wigner crystals. Our observations establish monolayer MoTe2 as a promising platform for exploring magnetic and dynamic properties of Wigner crystals.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures have been used to tailor atomic layers into various artificial materials through interactions at heterointerfaces. The interplay between the band gap created by the band folding of the interfacial potential and the band inversion driven by enhanced spin-orbit interaction (SOI) through band hybridization enables us to realize a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D-TI). Here we report the realization of graphene 2D-TIs by epitaxial growth of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) BiSbTeSe$_2$ ultrathin films on graphene. By increasing the BiSbTeSe$_2$ thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm to enhance SOI on graphene, the electronic state is altered from the trivial Kekul${é}$ insulator to the 2D-TI. The nonlocal transport reveals the helical edge conduction which survives up to 200 K at maximum. Our graphene 2D-TI is stable, easy to make electrical contacts, and of high quality.

            <p>We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Topology plays a cardinal role in explaining phases and quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In this study, we formulate a set of models of Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions with SU($N$)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry that have the potential to host critical points described by field theories with topological terms. For $N=2$ it shows a rich phase diagram containing semimetallic, quantum spin Hall insulating, Kekulé valence bond solid and s-wave superconducting phases and features multiple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phase transitions driven by interaction strength. At $N=1$ a deconfined quantum critical point is observed. At $N=2$ one expects the critical theory to correspond to a level 2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory in 2+1 dimensions. Here the numerical results however show a strong first order transition. Another transition can be governed by a topological $\theta$-term which is rendered irrelevant for even values of $N$ thus leading to Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson behaviour.</p>

            <p>In light of recent experimental data indicating a substantial thermal Hall effect in square lattice antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, we investigate whether a simple Mott insulator can sustain a finite thermal Hall effect. We verify that the answer is "no" if one performs calculations within a spin-only low-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by performing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a finite thermal Hall effect when $t' \neq 0$ and $B \neq 0$ in the Mott insulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for observing a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a semi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which finite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry argument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom that square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite thermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall effect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be excluded a priori.</p>

            <p>This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.</p>

            <h2>Ionic-bond-driven atom-bridged room-temperature Cooper pairing in cuprates and nickelates: a theoretical framework supported by 32 experimental evidences</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu</p>
            <p>Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates and nickelates. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in oxides, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli</p>
            <p>We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.</p>

            <p>The unique atomic monolayer structure of graphene gives rise to a broad range of remarkable mechanical folding properties. However, significant challenges remain in effectively harnessing them in a controllable and scalable manner. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that employs micron-scale cavities, fabricated through ultrafast laser patterning, in a stretchable polymer substrate to locally modulate adhesion and strain transfer to a graphene monolayer. This technique enables the deterministic induction of single folds in graphene with fold dimensions, width and height in the hundreds of nanometers, tunable through the geometry of the polymer cavities and the applied strain. Importantly, these folds are reversible, returning to a flat morphology with minimal structural damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, our method allows for the creation of fields of folds with reproducible periodicity, defining clear potential for practical applications. These findings pave the way for the development of advanced devices that would leverage the strain and morphology-sensitive properties of graphene.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration free models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple intra-unit-cell magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. Straight-forward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</p>

            <h2>Strong Correlations, Green's Function Zeros and Topological Transitions in Orbital-Symmetry-Controlled Chemical Reactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziren Xie, Amir Mirzanejad, Lukas Muechler</p>
            <p>We integrate concepts from topological band theory and strong-correlation physics with the principle of orbital symmetry conservation, which characterizes reactions as symmetry allowed or forbidden based on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. Using a $4\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity on the edge of vanishing magnetic order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Wang, Ke Wang, K. Levin</p>
            <p>There should be no question that magnetism and superconductivity appear in close proximity in many if not most of the unconventional superconductors. These two phases are importantly correlated: the strongest manifestations of this superconducting pairing are generally associated with the weakest magnetism. It is often stated that this behavior results from a quantum critical point (QCP), although not all such superconductors fit into this category. In this paper we consider a second scenario for addressing these proximity phenomena in which no QCP is present. Although there are other examples for this latter category, most notable are those associated with very strongly paired superconductors that have insulating and magnetically ordered ``parent" materials. Here, too, one finds that ``failed" long range order is key to establishing superconductivity. This leads to the general question, which is the focus of this paper. Why, and how, in either of these contexts, does this proximal magnetism play a constructive role in helping to stabilize superconductivity? Our understanding here should help pave the way towards the discovery of new families of superconductors, which are expected to emerge on the brink of magnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyohei Nakamura, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>A supercurrent is well recognized as being of prime importance within mean-field theory, but remains largely unexplored in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) and the quantum critical region. To clarify the impact of the supercurrent on magnetism and superconductivity near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, we study the two-dimensional Hubbard model based on a fluctuation exchange approximation for a current-carrying superconducting state. We show a supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetism and emergence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The former results from Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, suppression in the superconducting gap, and strong correlation effects beyond the mean-field theory. Our results suggest that the supercurrent can bring out rich phenomena of superconductivity in SCES.</p>

This methodology is illustrated in gapped single-layer and Bernal bilayer graphene but can be implemented in arbitrarily complex systems, including disordered and aperiodic systems, opening novel avenues for the design of multifunctional topological electronic devices that work in far-from-equilibrium regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu Yan, Hongxuan Er, Wei Dang, Jiahuan Ren, Chao Chen, Dianxiang Ren, Fulong Dong</p>
            <p>We investigated the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density-matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to graphene whose fishbone-shaped spectra primarily oscillates at twice the frequency of the pump laser, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits a first-order harmonic component induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into this interesting results, we employ a simplified model that considers only the nonequivalent electrons at $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points in the Brillouin zone. This model allows us to derive an analytical expression for the ATAS contribution stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, and reveal that the first-order harmonic component of spectra arises ont only from the Berry connections but also from the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.V. Sadovskii</p>
            <p>We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. Finally we discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants.</p>

            <p>Helical spin textures in one-dimensional magnetic chains on superconductors can enable topological superconductivity and host Majorana zero modes, independent of the presence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that gadolinium (Gd) adatoms, possessing large 4f magnetic moments when placed on a Nb(110) surface, establish indirect exchange interactions mediated by valence electrons, manifesting as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy with density functional theory, we analyze the emergence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in single Gd atoms and Gd dimers and uncover the underlying magnetic interaction mechanisms, on the basis of which we predict by means of spin-dynamics simulations the formation of stable chiral Néel-type spin-spiral configurations in Gd chains. These findings highlight rare-earth magnets as a promising platform for precisely tuning spin-spiral ground states, an essential prerequisite for the realization of topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We show that chiral edge states in graphene under Quantum Hall effect conditions can be selectively probed and excited by terahertz or infrared radiation with single-quasiparticle sensitivity without affecting bulk states. Moreover, valley-selective excitation of edge states is possible with high fidelity. The underlying physical mechanism is the inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This leads to the formation of Landau level-specific and valley-specific absorbance spectral peaks that are spectrally well separated from each other and from absorption by the bulk states, and have different polarization selection rules. Furthermore, inversion symmetry breaking enables coherent driving of chiral edge photocurrents due to second-order nonlinear optical rectification which becomes allowed in the electric dipole approximation.</p>

We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation.

            <p>Spin qubits in semiconducting quantum dots are currently limited by slow readout processes, which are orders of magnitude slower than gate operations. In contrast, Andreev spin qubits benefit from fast measurement schemes enabled by the large resonator couplings of superconducting qubits but suffer from reduced coherence during qubit operations. Here, we propose fast and high-fidelity measurement protocols based on an electrically-tunable coupling between quantum dot and Andreev spin qubits. In realistic devices, this coupling can be made sufficiently strong to enable high-fidelity readout well below microseconds, potentially enabling mid-circuit measurements. Crucially, the electrical tunability of our coupler permits to switch it off during idle periods, minimizing crosstalk and measurement back-action. Our approach is fully compatible with germanium-based devices and paves the way for scalable quantum computing architectures by leveraging the advantages of heterogeneous qubit implementations.</p>

            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for approximately counting the number of solutions to planar 2-satisfiability (2SAT) formulas natively on neutral atom quantum computers. Our algorithm maps Boolean variables to atomic registers arranged in space according to a given formula, so that 2SAT constraints are enforced via the Rydberg blockade between neighboring atoms. A quench under Rydberg dynamics of an initial computational basis state produces a superposition of all solutions after a sufficiently long evolution. For almost uniform superpositions, a polynomial number of measurements is enough to estimate the solution count up to any constant multiplicative factor via sampling based counting. We demonstrate numerically that this protocol leads to almost uniform solution sampling in 1D and 2D grids and that it produces accurate counts for 2SAT instances on punctured grids, suggesting its general applicability as a heuristic for #P-complete problems.</p>

            <p>We solve the one dimensional massive Thirring model or equivalently the sine-Gordon model in the repulsive regime with general Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are characterized by two boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}$ associated with the left and right boundaries respectively. In the presence of these boundary fields, which explicitly break the charge conjugation symmetry, the system exhibits a duality symmetry which changes the sign of the mass parameter $m_0$ and shifts the values of the boundary fields by $\phi_{L,R}\rightarrow \phi_{L,R}+\pi$. When the mass parameter $m_0<0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, or equivalently due to duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0>0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, the system is at a trivial point. Here, the ground state is unique just as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, when the mass parameter $m_0<0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, and equivalently due to the duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0>0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, the system is at a topological point where it exhibits a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, which is characterized by the existence of zero energy bound states at both the boundaries. For a given value of the mass parameter $m_0$, we find that these phases remain stable in the presence of symmetry breaking fields at the boundary, provided they are smaller than certain critical values which depend on the strength of the interactions in the bulk. Hence, we show that the stability of the SPT and trivial phases depends on the interplay of the symmetry breaking boundary field values and the bulk interaction strength.</p>

            <p>High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>La doped SrFeO$_{3}$, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$, exhibits a metal-to-insulator transition accompanied by both antiferromagnetic and charge ordering states along with the Fe-O bond disproportionation below a critical temperature near 200K. Unconventionally slow charge dynamics measured in this material near the critical temperature shows that its excited charge ordering states can exhibit novel electronic structures with nontrivial energy profiles. Here, we reveal possible metastable states of charge ordering structures in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ using the first-principle and climbing image nudged elastic band methods. In the strong correlation regime, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a charge ordering state of the big-small-big pattern, consistent with the experimental measurement of this material at the low temperature. As the correlation effect becomes weak, we find at least two possible metastable charge ordering states with the distinct Fe-O bond disproportionation. Remarkably, a ferroelectric metallic state emerges with the small energy barrier of $\sim$7 meV, driven by a metastable CO state of the small-medium-big pattern. The electronic structures of these metastable charge ordering states are noticeably different from those of the ground-state. Our results can provide an insightful explanation to multiple metastable charge ordering states and the slow charge dynamics of this and related oxide materials.</p>

            <p>The component of the resistivity tensor $\rho_{ij}$ corresponding to voltage transverse to both an applied current and a magnetic field can be separated into odd and even parts with respect to the applied magnetic field. The former contains information, for example, about the ordinary or anomalous Hall effect. The latter is often ascribed to experimental artefacts and ignored. Here, we show that upon suppressing these artefacts in carefully controlled experiments, useful information remains. We first investigate the well-explored ferromagnet CoFeB, where the even part of $\rho_{yx}$ contains a contribution from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which we confirm by Stoner--Wohlfarth modelling. We then apply our approach to magnetotransport measurements of $\rm Mn_5Si_3$ thin films, which undergo a transition from non-collinear to an altermagnetic collinear state. In this material, the even part of the transverse signal is sizable only in the low-spin-symmetry phase below $\approx 80$~K. Transverse resistivity measurements thus offer a simple and readily available probe of magnetic order transitions.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.</p>

            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>The effect of elastic-plastic mismatch and interface proximity on the fracture toughness of Ti-TiN thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nidhin George Mathews, Aloshious Lambai, Marcus Hans, Jochen M. Schneider, Gaurav Mohanty, Balila Nagamani Jaya</p>
            <p>Magnetron sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin films are widely used as protective coatings due to their high hardness, but suffer from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting their applicability. The multilayering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) interlayers in the form of bi-layer and tri-layer systems have been studied using microcantilever fracture tests. Plastic dissipation in the Ti layer is shown to lead to an increase in crack growth resistance. The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch between the two materials on the crack driving force, as well as the size of the fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified in this work for the first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm can improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the initiation fracture toughness in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these multi-layered films. These results will aid in physics informed design of optimised thickness of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin films.</p>

            <p>In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components are inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can facilitate the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising approach for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking, a cavity must discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality uniquely provided by chiral metamaterials. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for the selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific handedness. Our metasurface maintains maximal chirality for oblique incidence up to 20°, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby transforming the angle of incidence from a constraint into a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer-precise tuning of the cavity's resonant wavelength. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and reveal the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces as a novel and potent platform for chiral polaritonics with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as non-reciprocal photonic devices and valleytronics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Origin of the Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannis Ulrich, Johannes Mitscherling, Laura Classen, Andreas P. Schnyder</p>
            <p>We analyze the quantum geometric contribution to the intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) for a general multiband Hamiltonian. The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\text{Yb}_3\text{Pt}_4$, $\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\text{CoNb}_3\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\text{MnNb}_3\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.</p>

            <h2>Tunable anyonic permeability across ${\mathbb{Z}_2}$ spin liquid junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Bhattacharjee, Soumya Sur, Adhip Agarwala</p>
            <p>We introduce two classes of junctions in a toric code, a prototypical model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid, and study the nature of anyonic transport across them mediated by Zeeman fields. In the first class of junctions, termed potential barrier junctions, the charges sense effective static potentials and a change in the band mass. In a particular realization, while the junction is completely transparent to the electric charge, magnetic charge transmission is allowed only after a critical field strength. In the second class of junctions we stitch two toric codes with operators which do not commute at the junction. We show that the anyonic transmission gets tuned by effective pseudospin fluctuations at the junction. Using exact analytical mappings and numerical simulations, we compute charge-specific transmission probabilities. Our work, apart from uncovering the rich physical mechanisms at play in such junctions, can motivate experimental work to engineer defect structures in topologically ordered systems for tunable transport of anyonic particles.</p>

            <h2>Tunable symmetry breaking in a hexagonal-stacked moiré magnet</h2>

            <p>Symmetry plays a central role in defining magnetic phases, making tunable symmetry breaking across magnetic transitions highly desirable for discovering non-trivial magnetism. Magnetic moiré superlattices, formed by twisting two-dimensional (2D) magnetic crystals, have been theoretically proposed and experimentally explored as platforms for unconventional magnetic states. However, despite recent advances, tuning symmetry breaking in moiré magnetism remains limited, as twisted 2D magnets, such as rhombohedral (R)-stacked twisted CrI_3, largely inherit the magnetic properties and symmetries of their constituent layers. Here, in hexagonal-stacked twisted double bilayer (H-tDB) CrI_3, we demonstrate clear symmetry evolution as the twist angle increases from 180^{\circ} to 190^{\circ}. While the net magnetization remains zero across this twist angle range, the magnetic phase breaks only the three-fold rotational symmetry at 180^{\circ}, but it breaks all of the rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries at intermediate twist angles between 181^{\circ} and 185^{\circ}, and all broken symmetries are recovered at 190^{\circ}. These pronounced symmetry breakings at intermediate twist angles are accompanied by metamagnetic behaviors, evidenced by symmetric double hysteresis loops around zero magnetic field. Together, these results reveal that H-tDB CrI_3 at intermediate twist angles host a distinct moiré magnetic phase, featuring periodic in-plane spin textures with broken rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries, which is markedly different from the out-of-plane layered antiferromagnetism in bilayer CrI_3 and the predominantly out-of-plane moiré magnetism in R-tDB CrI_3. Our work establishes H-stacked CrI_3 moiré magnets as a versatile platform for engineering magnetic properties, including and likely beyond complex spin textures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitor Dantas, Héctor Ochoa, Rafael M. Fernandes, Natalia B. Perkins</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for probing moiré phonon modes using Raman spectroscopy, and illustrate it with the example of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). These moiré phonons arise from interlayer sliding motion in twisted 2D materials and correspond to fluctuations of the stacking order in reconstructed moiré superlattices. These include both acoustic-like phason modes and a new set of low-energy optical modes originating from the zone-folding of monolayer graphene's acoustic modes, which are accessible via Raman spectroscopy. We show that the Raman response of TBG exhibits a series of low-frequency peaks that clearly distinguish it from that of decoupled layers. We further examine the role of anharmonic interactions in shaping the phonon linewidths and demonstrate the strong dependence of the Raman spectra on both the twist angle and the polarization of the incident light. Our findings establish Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for exploring moiré phonons in a broad class of twisted van der Waals systems.</p>

            <p>Majorana modes offer great potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their topological protection. However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.</p>

            <h2>The influence of nitrogen doping and annealing on the silicon vacancy in 4H-SiC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel G. Carter, Infiter Tathfif, Charity Burgess, Brenda VanMil, Suryakanti Debata, Pratibha Dev</p>
            <p>The silicon vacancy ($V_{Si}$) in 4H-SiC at its cubic site (V2-center) has shown significant promise for quantum technologies, due to coherent spin states, the mature material system, and stable optical emission. In these SiC-based applications, doping plays a crucial role. It can be used to control the charge state of $V_{Si}$ and formation of different types of defects. Despite its importance, there has been little research on the effects of doping. In this work, we perform a study of the effects of nitrogen doping and annealing on the photoluminescence (PL), optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast, and dephasing times of ensembles of V2 in epilayers of 4H-SiC. The results show an enhancement of PL that depends on the electron irradiation dose for a given electron concentration, supported by theoretical modeling of the charge state of $V_{Si}$ in the presence of nitrogen. Nitrogen substituted for carbon is shown to very efficiently donate one electron to $V_{Si}$. We also observe that the ODMR contrast can be increased from 0.5% in low doped SiC to 1.5% by nitrogen doping of $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ and annealing at 500-600 $^{\circ}$C for 1 hour, with only a 20% decrease in PL compared to unannealed. Some of the improvement in contrast is offset by a reduction in $T_2^*$ at these doping levels, but the estimated cw ODMR shot-noise limited sensitivity is still 1.6 times higher than that of undoped, unannealed SiC.</p>

            <p>Crystal engineering is a method for discovering new quantum materials and phases, which may be achieved by external pressure or strain. Chemical pressure is unique in that it generates internal pressure perpetually to the lattice. As an example, GdAlSi from the rare-earth ($R$) $R$Al$X$ ($X =$ Si or Ge) family of Weyl semimetals is considered. Replacing Si with the larger isovalent element Ge creates sufficiently large chemical pressure to induce a structural transition from the tetragonal structure of GdAlSi, compatible with a Weyl semimetallic state, to an orthorhombic phase in GdAlGe, resulting in an inversion-symmetry-protected nodal-line metal. We find that GdAlGe hosts an antiferromagnetic ground state with two successive orderings, at $T_\mathrm{N1}$ = 35 K and $T_\mathrm{N2}$ = 30 K. In-plane isothermal magnetization shows a magnetic field induced metamagnetic transition at 6.2 T for 2 K. Furthermore, electron-hole compensation gives rise to a large magnetoresistance of $\sim 100\%$ at 2 K and 14 T. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a Dirac-like linear band dispersion over an exceptionally large energy range of $\sim$ 1.5 eV with a high Fermi velocity of $\sim 10^6$ m/s, a rare feature not observed in any magnetic topological materials.</p>

            <p>Intrinsic responses are of paramount importance in physics research, as they represent the inherent properties of materials, independent of extrinsic factors that vary from sample to sample, and often reveal the intriguing quantum geometry of the band structure. Here, we report the experimental discovery of a new intrinsic response in charge transport, specifically the intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE), in the topological semimetal TaIrTe4. This effect is characterized by an induced Hall current that is quadratic in the driving electric field and linear in the in-plane magnetic field. The response coefficient is determined by the susceptibility tensor of Berry-connection polarizability dipole, which is an intrinsic band geometric quantity. Remarkably, the signal persists up to room temperature. Our theoretical calculations show excellent agreement with the experimental results and further elucidate the significance of a previously unknown orbital mechanism in intrinsic NPHE. This finding not only establishes a novel intrinsic material property but also opens a new route toward innovative nonlinear devices capable of operating at room temperature.</p>

Electronic band structure,and density of states were calculated, and total energy have been defined in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. The band gap for the Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se, $x=0.06$ in ferromagnetic phase is equal to $E_g=1.77$ eV, in antiferromagnetic phase $E_g=1.78$ eV. For $x=0.25$, $E_g=1.92$ eV.

            <p>We analyze both the stationary and time-dependent properties of molecular states in atomic chains on a surface, some of which are composed of atomic states decoupled from the substrate - a phenomenon analogous to dark states in quantum dot systems. To illustrate this effect at the atomic scale, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments on short silicon chains fabricated on a Si(553)-Au surface. In contrast to quantum dots, which typically involve characteristic energies in the meV range or lower, the atomic chains studied here operate in a high-energy regime, with energies in the eV range. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local density of states of the chains carries clear signatures of these decoupled states, which significantly affect STM imaging. The topography becomes highly sensitive to the bias polarity, to the extent that some atomic sites may appear nearly invisible to the STM tip. Our time-resolved theoretical analysis reveals that these decoupled states emerge over a finite time interval. This oscillatory dynamical evolution, primarily driven by nearest-neighbor interactions, suggests a universal relaxation mechanism that is largely insensitive to the length of the atomic chain.</p>

            <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.</p>

We observe, depending on the model parameters, three qualitatively different regimes: (i) quantum interplay of quartic and quadratic interactions which suppresses effects of the quadratic coupling, (ii) intermediate-coupling regime with exponential $\propto \exp(\alpha g_2 \Omega^{-1/4})$ scaling of the quasiparticle weight and mass renormalization, and (iii) strong-coupling asymptotic behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moiré materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</p>

            <p>The role of twist angle ($\theta_t$) in tailoring the physical properties of heterostructures is emerging as a new paradigm in two-dimensional materials. The influence of flat electronic bands near the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^{\circ}$) on the phononic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the G and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from $\sim$0.3$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$3$^{\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key finding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to moiré potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the low-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of the 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased electron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sample ($\theta_t \sim$ 1$^{\circ}$) reveal an almost tenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both components of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system. These studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of the twisted bilayer graphene systems.</p>

Among them, the lack of magnetic order down to the milikelvin range in compounds with robust localized electronic moments and their nuclear magnetism. Although reminiscences of short range magnetic interactions may be observed below 1K, such perturbation can be dodged investigating compounds located close to a quantum critical point (QCP), where quantum fluctuations prevent the development of magnetic correlations to develop. Within the family of cubic YbCu4M compounds (M = Ni, Au and Zn), we have investigated YbCu4Zn that shows a logarithmic temperature dependence: C_P /T ~ ln(T/TQ) in its electronic specific heat, as predicted for a QCP. Simultaneously, no signs of RKKY interactions are detected down to 0.03K. Due to the low Kondo temperature of its doublet ground state, the localized 4f electrons weakly couple with conduction electrons, allowing the coupling between nuclear and 4f electron moments to become relevant. However, the reminder Kondo interaction acts on the electronic hyperfine field producing a small deviation from the standard nuclear C_N ~ 1/T^2 dependence into a n < 2 power law. The expected n = 2 dependence is progressively recovered under applied magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Corner Topology Makes Woven Baskets into Stiff, yet Resilient Metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guowei Wayne Tu, Evgueni T. Filipov</p>
            <p>Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.</p>

Hybrid circuit devices incorporating novel quantum materials could also lead to new qubit functionalities, such as gate tunability and noise resilience.

We present a design that enables us to systematically characterize the hybrid device, from DC transport of the S-TI-S junction, to RF spectroscopy, to full circuit QED control and measurement of the hybrid qubit. In addition, we utilize a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity to characterize material and fabrication-induced losses, thereby guiding our efforts to improve device quality.</p>

Starting from a discrete model of self-propelled rods with chemotactic responses, we employ a Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau (BGL) approach to derive coarse-grained dynamical equations for the density, polar and nematic orientational order parameters, and the concentration field of the chemoattractant. We perform a linear stability analysis for fluctuations around uniform steady states corresponding to isotropic and nematic phases. In both phases, we find that translational chemotactic response promotes instability, while rotational chemotactic response suppresses it, elucidating their contrasting effects on the onset of collective dynamics.</p>

We observe a metal-insulator transition characterized by the collapse of Drude response and the emergence of sharp and narrow absorption peaks at low temperatures. Unlike previous excitonic insulator candidates such as TiSe$_2$ and Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, where the excitonic order is intertwined with charge density wave or structural instabilities, the sharp features in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ point to intrinsic excitonic excitations associated with ultra-flat bands driven by many-body renormalization of the band structure via spontaneous exciton condensation. Our findings thus provide clear-cut optical evidence for exciton condensation in a bulk crystal and establish Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring correlated quantum phases and novel excitonic phenomena.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</p>

            <p>Bose-Einstein condensation of spin-polarized triplet excitons can give rise to an intriguing spin supercurrent, enabling experimental detection of exciton condensation. In this work, we predict that Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) ferromagnetic monolayers are spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators (EIs), based on the systematic first-principles GW calculations coupled with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW+BSE). The single-particle calculations of spin-polarized band structures reveal that these monolayers are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, where the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band possess opposite spin polarization. The two low-energy bands, primarily originating from Ta $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, are almost flat. The same-orbital parity and opposite-spin natures of the band-edge states effectively suppress dielectric screening, promoting the emergence of the EI state. The GW+BSE calculations reveal that the binding energy of the lowest-energy exciton is 1.499 eV for Ta3I8 monolayer and 1.986 eV for Ta3Br8 monolayer. Since both values exceed the respective GW band gaps, these results indicate a strong excitonic instability in these monolayers. A wavefunction analysis confirms that the lowest-energy exciton is a tightly bound Frenkel-like state, exhibiting a spin-polarized triplet nature with $S_z=1$. Our findings establish a valuable material platform for investigating spin-polarized triplet EIs, offering promising potential for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Ma, Michael E. Cates</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

We introduce an electron-phonon coupling strength threshold for low-temperature system instability, providing experimentalists with a tool to predict them. Finally, we validate the predictions of our model against first-principles calculations on a 4 Å-diameter carbon nanotube.</p>

Using this concept, we prove that local electron correlations in the Hubbard model are fully classical: in the natural basis the local reduced density matrix is separable and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.</p>

            <p>The dynamical structure factor of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) shows universal power-law divergence at its quantum critical point, signatures of which have been arguably observed in inelastic neutron scattering studies of quantum spin chain materials, for example CoNb2O6. However, it has been recently suggested that its microscopic description is better captured in terms of a twisted Kitaev spin chain (TKSC) with bond-anisotropic couplings. Here, we present exact results for the dynamical structure factor of the TKSC across its quantum critical point, analyzing both the universal low-frequency response and the non-universal high-energy features. In addition, we explore extensions of the model including broken glide symmetry as well as the case of random, and incommensurate magnetic fields. Notably, in the latter case the fermionic excitations exhibit a localization-delocalization transition, which is manifest in the dynamical response as a distinct signature at finite frequency. We discuss the relevance of these features for the observation of quantum critical response in experiments.</p>

            <p>In granular hopper flow, is the clogging probability influenced by gravity? Clogging, the spontaneous arrest of granular flow through a constriction, is a fundamental and widespread phenomenon in granular processing. Accurately predicting clogging risk is essential for space-related activities. Yet, conflicting results leave us without a reliable way to extrapolate terrestrial data to low gravity. We introduce an in-bulk definition of the dimensionless granular Bond number, B, to scale clogging probability from Earth gravity to low gravity. By testing multiple lunar regolith simulants in Earth and Moon gravitational accelerations, using an active drop tower, we reveal that low gravity significantly increases clogging risk, challenging previous findings. We observe a gravity-induced shift in the critical orifice below which clogging occurs by up to one order of magnitude. Scaling data with the Bond number unifies scattered results into a state diagram predicting clogging across materials and gravitational accelerations. Our findings provide a practical tool for anticipating granular clogging in reduced gravity, informing future space missions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milena Petkovic, Natasha Dropka, Xia Tang, Janina Zittel</p>
            <p>The Czochralski (Cz) method is a widely used process for growing high-quality single crystals, critical for applications in semiconductors, optics, and advanced materials. Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity -- especially for new materials -- limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the role of bubble positioning in the force-induced melting of double-stranded DNA using two distinct approaches: Brownian Dynamics simulations and the Gaussian Network Model. We isolate the effect of bubble positioning by using DNA molecules with 50% AT - 50% GC base-pair composition which ensures constant enthalpy. Our results reveal that it is not just the sequence itself, but its specific arrangement that influences DNA stability. We examine two types of DNA sequences containing a block of either AT or GC base-pairs, resulting in the formation of a large bubble or a smaller bubble within the DNA, respectively. By systematically shifting these blocks along the strand, we investigate how their positioning influences the force-temperature phase diagram of DNA. Our Brownian dynamics simulations reveal that, at high forces, melting of the entire DNA strand is initiated after stretching $\approx 9$ GC base-pairs, independent of the specific base-pair sequence. In contrast, no such characteristic length scale is observed in the Gaussian network model. Our study suggests that free strand entropy plays a significant role in determining the force-temperature phase diagram of the DNA.</p>

            <p>Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics. The origins of this subdiffusion are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multi-exponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD over a finite range of time. We show that friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient for capturing the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates from memory effects, not from the free energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.</p>

            <p>The coarse-grained interactions between Néel skyrmions, stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling (iDMI), are studied through the properties of their hexagonal lattices by micromagnetic simulations. The interactions with the film edges are excluded by imposing periodic boundary conditions. The dependence of skyrmion size and interaction energy on the distance is derived. Two types of behavior are observed depending on the value of iDMI compared to the critical value Dc above which the skyrmion size diverges: For iDMI < Dc the skyrmions acquire a finite size that saturates at maximum value independent of the skyrmion distance that corresponds to the one of the isolated skyrmion. This energy is above that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state. For iDMI > Dc the skyrmions tend to increase in size to the extent that their neighboring skyrmions permit and finite size skyrmions can be stabilized only in arrays due to their mutual repulsion. These configurations have energy below that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state.</p>

            <p>The energy band alignment at the interface of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a key design parameter for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Although the Anderson and midgap models have been widely adopted for bulk semiconductor heterostructures, they exhibit severe limitations when applied to vdWHs, particularly for type-III systems. Based on first-principles calculations for approximately $10^3$ vdWHs, we demonstrate these traditional models miss a critical dipole arising from interlayer charge spillage. We introduce a generalized linear response (gLR) model that includes this dipole through a quantum capacitance term while remaining analytically compact. With only two readily computed inputs, the charge neutrality level offset and the sum of the isolated-layer bandgaps, the gLR reproduces DFT band line-ups with $r^2\sim$0.9 across type-I, II, and III stacks. Machine-learning feature analysis confirms that these two descriptors dominate the underlying physics, indicating the model is near-minimal and broadly transferable. The gLR framework therefore provides both mechanistic insight and a fast, accurate surrogate for high-throughput screening of the vast vdW heterostructure design space.</p>

            <p>A recent experiment has reported unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, emerging from a normal state that exhibits a finite anomalous Hall effect -- a signature of intrinsic chirality. Motivated by this discovery, we construct a continuum model for twisted MoTe$_2$ constrained by lattice symmetries from first-principles calculations that captures the moiré-induced inversion symmetry breaking even in the absence of a displacement field. Building on this model, we show that repulsive interactions give rise to finite-momentum superconductivity via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism in this chiral moiré system. Remarkably, the finite-momentum superconducting state can arise solely from internal symmetry breaking of the moiré superlattice, differentiating it from previously studied cases that require external fields. It further features a nonreciprocal quasiparticle dispersion and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect. Our results highlight a novel route to unconventional superconducting states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides moiré systems, driven entirely by intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at complex oxide interfaces offer a unique platform to engineer quantum nanostructures. However, scalable fabrication of locally addressable devices in these materials remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient fabrication approach by patterning narrow constrictions in a superconducting KTaO3-based heterostructure. The constrictions are individually tunable via the coplanar side gates formed within the same 2DEG plane. Our technique leverages the high dielectric permittivity of KTaO3 (epsilon_r ~ 5000) to achieve strong electrostatic modulation of the superconducting 2DEG. Transport measurements through the constriction reveal a range of transport regimes: Within the superconducting state, we demonstrate efficient modulation of the critical current and Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition temperature at the weak link. Further tuning of the gate voltage reveals an unexpectedly regular Coulomb blockade pattern. All of these states are achievable with a side gate voltage |V_SG| < 1 V. The fabrication process is scalable and versatile, enabling a platform both to make superconducting field-effect transistors and to study a wide array of physical phenomena present at complex oxide interfaces.</p>

            <p>Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization?</h2>

            <p>Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.</p>

This study utilizes time-lapse X-ray and spectral micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and deep learning-assisted image analysis to investigate halite crystallization and brine consumption in porous medium. We identified three-dimensional halite growth structures functioning as a secondary porous medium. Visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of salt-brine coexistence and halite precipitation revealed critical insights into the self-enhancing nature of salt growth. Expanding gas-liquid contact surfaces and initial crystal nucleation sites significantly enhanced evaporation and growth rates. Hydrophilic halite crystals attract brine films, establishing a feedback loop that perpetuates growth. The encapsulation of brine between grain surfaces and umbrella-like salt crusts was observed. Delineating the self-enhancing growth, including the role of capillary forces and surface-interface processes, is crucial for improving CO$_2$ injection efficiency and integrity, as well as for addressing environmental challenges related to soil salinization.</p>

            <h2>Differentiable neural network representation of multi-well, locally-convex potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reese E. Jones, Adrian Buganza Tepole, Jan N. Fuhg</p>
            <p>Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes. This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for gradient-based learning and inference. A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression, enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability, making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and physical simulation.</p>

            <p>Version 14 of XtalOpt, evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website this https URL. The new version of the code is designed to perform ground state search for novel crystal structures with variable composition by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been further enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Here, we describe the implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in XtalOpt version 14.</p>

            <h2>AutomataGPT: Forecasting and Ruleset Inference for Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaime A. Berkovich, Noah S. David, Markus J. Buehler</p>
            <p>Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijit Mukherjee, Michał Tomza</p>
            <p>We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked tetratomic molecules (FL tetramers) to deeper bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation (PA) of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement STIRAP and PA using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akarsh Aurora, Alexis R Devitre, Angus PC Wylie, Jonas A Rajagopal, Michael P Short</p>
            <p>Commercial fusion power plants demand magnet materials that retain structural integrity and thermal conductivity while operating under the bombardment of energetic neutrons at cryogenic temperatures. Understanding how thermo-mechanical properties evolve under such extreme loads is crucial for selecting materials with high radiation tolerance and predictable failure mechanisms. Presented here is a facility that combines cryogenic transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) with simultaneous ion irradiation, enabling in-situ measurements of thermal diffusivity and surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency spectra. Employing copper as a benchmark material, an irradiation was performed at 30 K with 12.4 MeV $\text{Cu}^{6+}$ ions producing a final fluence of $1.9 \times 10^{17}$ ions/m$^2$. Over the irradiation period, thermal diffusivity nearly halved from an initial value of $1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$ while SAW speed did not show significant change, maintaining a value of $2162\pm18$ m/s. Given its real-time monitoring capability and the numerous candidate materials that remain uncharacterized under fusion magnet operating conditions, this facility is poised to deliver new scientific insights into fusion magnet material degradation trends, contributing to improved design criteria and operational certainty for forthcoming fusion power plants.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Hysteresis Experiments Performed on Quantum Annealers</h2>

            <p>Quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on exotic spin systems that model quantum materials. However, quantum annealing experiments have yet to explore magnetic memory and hysteresis, features seemingly at odds with hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling, favoring forgetfulness. Here, we present a general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis in a transverse-field Ising model. We implement it on three D-Wave superconducting flux qubit annealers, using up to thousands of spins, and explore both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models across contrasting graph topologies. Crucially, we observe robust memory retention in hysteresis loops, establishing quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena. This approach enables many topics of future exploration including return point memory and hysteresis in frustrated or topologically ordered systems, thus broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Ronald Wilfrid Gurney is one of the lesser-known research students of the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid 1920s. Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke. With the approach of the 100th year anniversary of quantum mechanics, it is timely to commemorate the life and contributions of this somewhat forgotten physicist.</p>

Our Multi-NARP scheme does not rely on polarization filtering and thus enables the near-unity extraction efficiency of single photons from each quantum dot. Our approach also offers the advantages of robustness to variations in the laser pulse parameters and immunity to excitation-induced dephasing tied to electron-phonon coupling. We show that simultaneous triggering of at least 10 emitters is possible, enabling the development of high-bandwidth quantum networks.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen-based materials are able to possess extremely high superconducting critical temperatures, \tc s, due to hydrogen's low atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interaction. Recently, a descriptor based on the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has enabled the rapid estimation of the \tc\ of hydrogen-containing compounds from electronic networking properties, but its applicability has been limited by the small size and homogeneity of the training dataset used. Herein, the model is re-examined compiling a publicly available combined dataset of 244 binary and ternary hydride superconductors. Our analysis shows that though ELF-based networking remains a valuable descriptor, its predictive power declines with increasing compositional complexity. However, by introducing the molecularity index, defined as the highest value of the ELF at which two hydrogen atoms connect, and applying symbolic regression, the accuracy of the predictions can be substantially enhanced. These results establish a more robust framework for assessing superconductivity in hydride materials, facilitating accelerated screening of novel candidates through integration with crystal structure prediction methods or high-throughput searches.</p>

            <p>We present a dry surface treatment combining atomic layer etching and deposition (ALE and ALD) to mitigate dielectric loss in fully fabricated superconducting quantum devices formed from aluminum thin films on silicon. The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach to predict true stress-strain curves of high-strength steels from small punch test (SPT) load-displacement data. The proposed approach uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) to transform load-displacement sequences into images, capturing spatial-temporal features and employs a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by multi-head cross-attention to improved accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy, with minimum and maximum mean absolute errors of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa, respectively. The proposed method offers a promising alternative to traditional experimental techniques in materials science, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of true stress-strain relationship predictions.</p>

            <p>Why are human societies unstable? Theories based on the observation of recurring patterns in historical data indicate that economic inequality, as well as social factors are key drivers. So far, models of this phenomenon are more macroscopic in nature. However, basic mechanisms at work could be accessible to minimal mathematical models. Here we combine a simple mechanism for economic growth with a mechanism for the spreading of social dissatisfaction. Broad wealth distributions generated by the economic mechanism eventually trigger social unrest and the destruction of wealth, leading to an emerging pattern of boom and bust. We find that the model time scales compare well with empirical data. The model emphasizes the role of broad (power law) wealth distributions for dynamical social phenomena.</p>

            <p>Imaging of microwave magnetic fields with nano-scale resolution has interesting applications. Specifically, detecting the orientation of the microwave fields is useful in condensed matter physics and quantum control. However, most of the existing methods for microwave field imaging are limited to detecting the magnitude of the fields. Due to their small sensor size and favorable optical and spin properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly suitable for imaging dc and ac magnetic fields. The reported methods for detecting the orientation of microwave magnetic fields use pulsed Rabi frequency measurements. Here, we demonstrate imaging of the orientation of microwave magnetic fields by only using continuous-wave experiments on NV centers. This simplifies the sensor apparatus and is particularly advantageous in applications where pulsing of the target microwave field is not possible. The method requires static bias magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the quantization axis of NV centers. We detect the direction of an arbitrary microwave magnetic field using NV centers of two different orientations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the projection of the microwave fields onto a plane can be imaged using NV centers of single orientation. It can be straightforwardly implemented using a single NV center.</p>

            <p>Granular flow down an inclined plane is ubiquitous in geophysical and industrial applications. On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's velocity profile and follows the so-called $\mu(I)$ local rheology. On insufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the bottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is not predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method simulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows down both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a dimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional plane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip regime ($R_a \lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip regime ($R_a \gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip regime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature) of the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip laws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local shear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover, the basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends somewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show that the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\mu(I)$ rheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic theory for granular flows. Our findings can help develop more predictive granular flow models in the future.</p>

            <p>Optical neural networks are emerging as a powerful and versatile tool for processing optical signals directly in the optical domain with superior speed, integrability, and functionality. Their application to optical polarization enables neuromorphic polarization sensors, but their operation is limited to fully-polarized light. Here, we demonstrate single-shot analysis of partially-polarized beams with a photonic random neural network (PRNN). The PRNN is composed of a series of optical layers implemented by a stack of scattering media and a few trainable digital nodes. The setup infers the degree-of-polarization and the Stokes parameters of the polarized component with precision comparable to off-the-shelf polarimeters. The use of several optical layers allows to enhance the accuracy, reduce the sensor size, and minimize digital costs, demonstrating the advantage of a deep optical encoder for processing polarization information. Our results point out photonic neural networks as fast, compact, broadband, low-cost polarimeters that are widely applicable from sensing to imaging.</p>

            <p>Topological properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures, described by mixed states, pose significant challenges due to the triviality of the Uhlmann bundle. We introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number, to characterize the topological properties of mixed states. By inserting the density matrix into the Chern character, we introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number that reduces to the pure-state value in the zero-temperature limit and vanishes at infinite temperature, providing a framework to study the temperature-dependent evolution of topological features in mixed states. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous mathematical proof that the first- and higher-order Uhlmann-Chern numbers converge to the corresponding Chern numbers in the zero-temperature limit, differing only by a factor of $1/D$ for $D$-fold degenerate ground states. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through applications to a two-level system, the coherent state model, the 2D Haldane model, and a four-band model, highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of topological invariants. Our results establish a robust bridge between the topological properties of pure and mixed states, offering new insights into finite-temperature topological phases.</p>

            <p>The most studies on the stability of foam bubbles investigated the mechanical stability of thin films between bubbles due to the drainage by gravity. In the current work, we take an alternative approach by assuming the rupture of bubbles as a series of random events and by investigating the time evolution of the size distribution of foam bubbles over a long time up to several hours. For this purpose, we first prepared layers of bubbles on Petri dishes by shaking soap solutions of a few different concentrations, and then we monitored the Petri dishes by using a time-lapse video imaging technique. We analyzed the captured images by custom software to count the bubble size distribution with respect to the initial concentration and elapsed time. From the statistics on our data, we find that the total bubble volume decreases exponentially in time, and the exponent, i.e. the mean lifetime, is a function of the bubble size. The mean lifetimes of larger bubbles are observed to be shorter than those of smaller bubbles, by approximately a factor of 2.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Qing, Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-André model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.</p>

            <p>We present a Solid-State Optical Magnetometer (SOM) based on black phosphorus (BP) multilayers, offering a compact, scalable, and highly sensitive alternative to traditional atomic-based magnetometers. Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared > 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies. This work establishes BP metasurface integration as a promising platform for low-power, miniaturized, and high-performance magnetic field sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Hong-Yi Wang, Zhong Wang, Xiao-Liang Qi</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</p>

            <p>Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladislav Efremkin, Julian Heske, Thomas D. Kühne, Emil Prodan</p>
            <p>Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</p>

            <h2>TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guochu Deng</p>
            <p>Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</p>

            <p>One of the roadblocks towards the implementation of a fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processor is impacts of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. Such impacts temporarily elevate the density of quasiparticles (QPs) across the device, leading to correlated qubit error bursts. The most damaging errors, $T_1$ errors, stem from QP tunneling across the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs). Recently, we demonstrated that this type of error can be strongly suppressed by engineering the profile of superconducting gap at the JJs in a way that prevents QP tunneling. In this work, we identify a new type of impact-induced correlated error that persists in the presence of gap engineering. We observe that impacts shift the frequencies of the affected qubits, and thus lead to correlated phase errors. The frequency shifts are systematically negative, reach values up to $3\,{\rm MHz}$, and last for $\sim 1\,{\rm ms}$. We provide evidence that the shifts originate from QP-qubit interactions in the JJ region. Further, we demonstrate that the shift-induced phase errors can be detrimental to the performance of quantum error correction protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a Rényi generalized mutual information, connecting between Rényi mutual information and Rényi Shannon mutual information. This Rényi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in Rényi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the Rényi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional Rényi Shannon mutual information and Rényi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the Rényi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the Rényi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that Rényi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.</p>

            <h2>Xenophobia based on a few attributes can impede society's cohesiveness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro Castro, Tuan Minh Pham, Ernesto Ortega, David Machado</p>
            <p>Xenophobic interactions play a role as important as homophilic ones in shaping many dynamical processes on social networks, such as opinion formation, social balance, or epidemic spreading. In this paper, we use belief propagation and Monte Carlo simulations on tree-like signed graphs to predict that a sufficient propensity to xenophobia can impede a consensus that would otherwise emerge via a phase transition. As the strength of xenophobic interactions and the rationality of individuals with respect to social stress decrease, this transition changes from continuous to discontinuous, with a strong dependence on the initial conditions. The size of the parameter region where consensus can be reached from any initial condition decays as a power-law function of the number of discussed topics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Wijnen, J. Parker, M. Gagliano, E. Martínez-Pañeda</p>
            <p>We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio Cerezo-Roquebrún, Simon Hands, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirakjyoti Sarma, Nilakshi Das</p>
            <p>The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nassim Derriche, George Sawatzky</p>
            <p>We present a novel and efficient real space, semiclassical model of electric polarization with general applicability to any system in which screening plays an important role. This model includes the effects of both atomic and bond polarizabilities, the latter originating from the modification of local bond charge transfer energies induced by polarizing charges. The nonlinear interference of multiple polarization clouds and the emergence of local field effects are highlighted as key phenomena highly influencing the short-range screening of the Coulomb interaction. As a representative system to showcase this model, the screened interaction between doped holes in the CuO$_2$ planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors is investigated. This leads to the emergence of striking direction-dependent short-range minima in their Coulomb repulsion, which can strongly reduce the need for retardation effects and allow for an enhancement of the attractive interaction resulting from the exchange of bosons between two electrons or holes. This in turn enhances T$_C$, shortens the Cooper pair coherence length and supports the materialization of the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</p>

            <p>The synthesis of nm-thick epitaxial films of iron garnets by physical vapor deposition has opened up exciting opportunities for the on-chip generation and processing of microwave signals encoded in magnons. However, iron garnet thin films suffer from demanding lattice-matching and stoichiometry requirements. Here a new approach to their synthesis is developed, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of iron garnet compositions based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides. By substituting a controlled proportion of iron with additional yttrium, Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality are obtained, combining a widely tunable lattice parameter and excellent magnetization dynamics. This enables iron garnet thin films suited for cryogenic applications, which have long remained impractical due to microwave losses caused by paramagnetic garnet substrates. Low-temperature ferromagnetic resonance confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetic losses for Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films lattice-matched to Y$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$ (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate. The Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates such as (Gd,Y)$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$. Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also have ideal lattice matching to YSGG, demonstrating the versatility of this approach. This opens unprecedented options for cation substitutions in iron garnet films, offering a promising avenue to new properties and quantum magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits can exhibit quantized energy levels and long coherence times. Harnessing the anharmonicity offered by Josephson junctions, such circuits have been successfully employed as qubits, quantum limited amplifiers and sensors. Here, we consider superfluidity as the charge-neutral analogue of superconductivity. Both dissipationless mass flow and Josephson tunneling have been demonstrated in superfluid helium. We propose a quantum device, consisting of a superfluid weak link and a mechanical element. The superfluid motion in this device is quantized. The resulting discrete energy levels are resolvable at millikelvin temperatures essential to maintaining the superfluid state. Appropriate device engineering can yield the necessary nonlinearity to realize qubit functionality. Hence, this device can potentially operate as a charge-neutral, superfluid quantum bit with micron-sized dimensions and millisecond scale coherence time. We show that this quantum regime is within reach for a range of device designs.</p>

            <p>We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</p>

            <h2>Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatially Disordered Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tu Hong, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistivity and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, though temperature limitations prevent us from observing the linear-in-temperature scattering rate. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.</p>

            <p>Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between superexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory demonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.</p>

            <p>We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three super-selection sectors of the Kitaev model (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons), perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.</p>

            <p>Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</p>

            <p>Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</p>

            <p>We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The results are compared with a recently developed theory \cite{ToBe} of sliding wear based on crack propagation (fatigue), originally formulated for elastic contact and here extended to include plasticity. The elastoplastic wear model predicts wear rates that agree reasonably well with the experimental results for PMMA and soda-lime glass. However, deviations observed for quartz suggest that material-specific deformation mechanisms, particularly the differences between crystalline and amorphous structures, may need to be considered for accurate wear predictions across different materials. In addition, the model reveals a non-monotonic dependence of the wear rate on the penetration hardness $\sigma_{\rm P}$. Thus, for plastically soft material, the wear rate increases with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$, while for hard materials, it decreases. This contrasts with Archard's wear law, where the wear rate decreases monotonically with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$.</p>

            <h2>New models of clean and hydrogenated amorphous silicon surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kishor Nepal, Aashish Gautam, Chinonso Ugwumadu, David Drabold</p>
            <p>We present new atomistic models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) surfaces. The a-Si model included 4096 atoms and was obtained using local orbital density functional theory. By analyzing a slab model (periodic in two dimensions with a slab about 44 Å thick), we observed a strong correlation between surface structure and surface charge density, which might be compared to STM experiments. Hydrogen atoms added near the under-coordinated surface atoms passivate dangling bonds and induce structural rearrangements. We analyze the electronic structure, including the localization of the states, and note resonant mixing between bulk and surface defect structures. We also compute the classical normal modes of the hydrogenated a-Si and compare them to experiments where possible. Our work is a step toward understanding the meaning of ``surface reconstruction" for a noncrystalline material.</p>

            <p>We present a study of low-concentration Zn (II) impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal (ZNLA) employing resonant Raman scattering and optical absorption spectroscopy. By analyzing the relative integrated intensity of the selective vibrational modes, we observe a resonant enhancement of Raman-active modes near the UV absorption band, associated with vibrations of the amino and carboxyl groups in ZNLA. These findings suggest that zinc cations occupy an interstitial position coordinated by amino and carboxyl groups. Also, ZNLA single crystal shows a strong antiresonance behavior for some modes associated with amino and carboxyl groups. The antiresonance model in the cross-section allowed the estimation of the bandgap to be 3.8 eV, which perfectly agrees with the direct bandgap obtained from the absorption spectrum (3.75 eV). Finally, our approach proves to be useful for detecting interactions between transition metal ion impurities and intramolecular structures in other transition metal-doped organic amino acid systems.</p>

            <h2>Theory of fractional corner charges in cylindrical crystal shapes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hidetoshi Wada, Tiantian Zhang, Shuichi Murakami</p>
            <p>Recent studies showed that topologically trivial insulators may have fractionally quantized corner charges due to the topological invariant called a filling anomaly. Such crystal shapes in three dimensions are restricted to vertex-transitive polyhedra, which are classified into spherical and cylindrical families. The previous works derived formulas of the fractional corner charge for the spherical family, which corresponds to the tetrahedral and cubic space groups (SGs). In this study, we derive all the corner charge formulas for the cylindrical family, which corresponds to the orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal crystal shapes. We show that all the real-space formulas of the filling anomaly for the cylindrical SGs are universally determined by the total charges at the Wyckoff position (WP) 1a. Moreover, we derive the k-space formulas of the corner charge for the cylindrical cases with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). From our results, we also show that CsLi$_{2}$Cl_{3}, KN_{3}, and Li_{3}N are candidate materials with a quantized corner charge by using the ab initio calculations. Together with our previous work, we exhaust corner charge formulas for all the SGs and crystal shapes having quantized corner charges.</p>

            <h2>Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Michel Pino, Rubén Seoane-Souto, Maria José Calderón, Ramón Aguado, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel</p>
            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Qing Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang, L. F. Quezada, Shi-Hai Dong, Dan-Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Recent studies of 2D moiré materials have opened opportunities for advancing condensed matter physics. However, the effect of 1D moiré potentials on topological and correlated phases remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal a sequence of trivial-to-topological transitions and periodic-moiré-spin density waves induced by the 1D commensurate moiré potentials for spin-1/2 fermionic atoms. Such reentrant topology from a trivial phase is absent without the moiré potential and can be understood as the renormalization of topological parameters by the moiré strength. We then unveil the critical exponent and localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates. The periodic spin density wave of many-body ground states is contributed by the moiré potential, and is enhanced by on-site interactions but suppressed by nearest-neighbor interactions. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moiré systems, and the realization of the proposed model is promising in near-future ultracold atom setups.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</p>
            <p>We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

            <h2>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune</p>
            <p>Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</p>

            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yao Du, Jonas Veenstra, Ryan van Mastrigt, Corentin Coulais</p>
            <p>Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</p>

            <h2>Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhangkai Cao, Shuning Tan, Ji Liu, Xiaosen Yang, Tao Ying, Ho-Kin Tang, Cho-Tung Yip</p>
            <p>Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p>

            <p>The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</p>

            <p>The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</p>

Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</p>

            <p>Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely low-energy optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the low-lying optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that low-energy optical modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.</p>

            <p>We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</p>

            <p>We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room-temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308 %, TER of 707 %, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic-sensing and quantum logic nano-devices.</p>

The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per plaquette, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junction array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junction central weak link area.</p>

            <p>We investigate the squared sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the linear spin wave theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashmi Kandari, Rudolf Podgornik, Sunita Kumari</p>
            <p>Precisely controlling the surface charge of zwitterionic macromolecules is crucial for tailoring their properties and optimizing them for specific applications. Here, we present a generalized calculation scheme for determining the screening length in solutions containing zwitterionic macroions, where the charge of the macroion is controlled by the electrolyte solution. This scheme bypasses the need to solve the Poisson Boltzmann equation by expressing the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative of pressure with respect to chemical potential. The scheme reveals that the screening length has two components: one related to the Debye length with effective charges, and another stemming from the macroion surface dissociation equilibrium, which exhibits a screening resonance behavior. Furthermore, we find that the nonuniform surface charge distribution induced by pH responsive charge regulation strongly affects the screening behavior. The charge regulation properties of macroions, even in dilute solutions, are a key factor in the screening of electrostatic interactions, offering insights into complex biological and nanomaterial systems.</p>

            <h2>Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Gualerzi, Leonardo Pisani, Pierbiagio Pieri</p>
            <p>We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</p>

            <h2>Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. E. Koshelev</p>
            <p>The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science and technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have encountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and competitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multi-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions emerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically defined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for ultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the next generation of topologically defined devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra Jurgens, James P. Crutchfield</p>
            <p>A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. The bidirectional machine is an ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally by making explicit in its state structure all statistical correlation in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurement of a bit, the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming this via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to prediction and retrodiction. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable measures that characterize a process' informational structure. In addition, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.</p>

            <h2>Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Hosseinabadi, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, Eugene Demler, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</p>

            <p>The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited in this material.</p>

            <h2>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</p>

More recently, because of an investigation of a so-called anomalous Hall effect, or topological Hall effect, and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction [W. Yao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 186501 (2025)]. Iron moments in the two-dimensional layers of a hexagonal nuclear structure undergo collinear antiferromagnetic order below a temperature 500 K. The moments depart from the c axis in a spontaneous transition at 63 K to an orthorhombic structure. The magnetism of Yb ions appears to behave independently, which can be confirmed using resonant x-ray diffraction enhanced by a Fe atomic resonance. The inferred magnetic space group is a P(parity)T(time)-symmetric (anti-inversion collinear antiferromagnet. A linear magnetoelectric effect is allowed, as in historically important chromium sesquioxide, and Kerr rotation and the piezomagnetic effect are forbidden. Symmetry informed Bragg diffraction patterns for future x-ray and neutron experiments are shown to be rich in Fe magnetic properties of orthorhombic YbFe6Ge6, including space-spin correlations, anapoles and Dirac quadrupoles familiar in high-Tc ceramic superconductors.</p>

Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</p>

Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials.

            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.</p>

            <p>Materials properties depend strongly on chemical composition, i.e., the relative amounts of each chemical element. Changes in composition lead to entirely different chemical arrangements, which vary in complexity from perfectly ordered (i.e., stoichiometric compounds) to completely disordered (i.e., solid solutions). Accurately capturing this range of chemical arrangements remains a major challenge, limiting the predictive accuracy of machine learning potentials (MLPs) in materials modeling. Here, we combine information theory and machine learning to optimize the sampling of chemical motifs and design MLPs that effectively capture the behavior of metallic alloys across their entire compositional and structural landscape. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by predicting the compositional dependence of various material properties - including stacking-fault energies, short-range order, heat capacities, and phase diagrams - for the AuPt and CuAu binary alloys, the ternary CrCoNi, and the TiTaVW high-entropy alloy. Extensive comparison against experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this approach in enabling materials modeling with high physical fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Brunner, Christian F. Schmidt, Stefan Floerchinger</p>
            <p>We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</p>

            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</p>

            <p>In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</p>

While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.</p>

We start by recalling the main derivation steps of a propagator using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. The mean exit time, the moment-generating function, and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker-Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times such as detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion.

            <p>This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.</p>

As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system, \begin{align*} \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big), \end{align*} where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Qin Chen, Shuo Liu, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-André models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. These numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</p>

            <h2>A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Eilers, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer, Sven Goedeke</p>
            <p>State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.</p>

            <h2>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhang, Jing-Yuan Chen</p>
            <p>Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</p>

            <p>Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</p>

            <p>Quantum states featuring extensive multipartite entanglement are a resource for quantum-enhanced metrology, with sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. However, robust generation of these states using unitary dynamics typically requires all-to-all interactions among particles. Here, we demonstrate that optimal states for quantum sensing can be generated with sparse interaction graphs featuring only a logarithmic number of couplings per particle. We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alice Doimo, Giorgio Nicoletti, Davide Bernardi, Prajwal Padmanabha</p>
            <p>Spatial metapopulation models are fundamental to theoretical ecology, enabling to study how landscape structure influences global species dynamics. Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.</p>

            <p>Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</p>

            <p>Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</p>

Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</p>

            <h2>Non-Gaussian Noise Magnetometry Using Local Spin Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan B. Curtis, Amir Yacoby, Eugene Demler</p>
            <p>Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</p>

            <h2>The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barak Budnick, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 < \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta<0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m>0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)<\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)<\eta<1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined this http URL implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</p>

            <p>One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</p>

            <p>Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</p>

            <p>Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p>

            <p>Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</p>

            <p>Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of Séamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. Röhler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.</p>

            <p>The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</p>

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation.

            <h2>Mean-field theory of the electromagnon resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel A. Andreev, Mariya Iv. Trukhanova</p>
            <p>We present the analytical theory of the electromagnon resonance for the multiferroics of spin origin. We consider the spin density evolution under the influence of magnetoelectric coupling in the presence of the electromagnetic wave. The dielectric permeability is found for the eigen-wave perturbations accompanied by perturbations of the electric field. The imaginary part of the dielectric permeability is found as the function of the applied electric field frequency, while the frequency of the eigen-waves is found from the dispersion equation as the function of the wave vector and parameters of the system. The result shows the existence of two peaks. One sharp peak is associated with the magnon resonance, while the second wide peak at the approximately four times smaller frequency is interpreted as the electromagnon resonance in accordance with existing experimental data.</p>

Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of sodium atoms confined in an optical dipole trap to simulate the matter-wave on the swing. Under the driving of Anti-Sisyphus process, the swing was excited successfully. Moreover, the spin echo like behavior and collective-mode excitation appear during the oscillation of matter-wave swing, manifesting the quantum nature of the system beyond its classical counterpart. Our work lays the foundation for matter-wave on the swing and more generally points to a future of practical applications for the motional quantum states linked with quantum information science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyue Zhou, Yi Chan, Siyuan Zhu, Fu Deng, Wei Bai, Jingdi Zhang</p>
            <p>We report on an ultrafast terahertz spectroscopic study on the dynamics of free carriers and the pertinent bulk plasmons in Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te (MCT) film, a narrowband semiconductor accommodating three dimensional massless Kane fermions. The ultrabroadband terahertz source enables the investigation of the lightly doped equilibrium state in the presence of plasmon-phonon hybridization through the heavily doped excited state, primarily dominated by plasmons. Without the recourse to the resource consuming cryogenic high magnetic field spectroscopy that hinges on observable related to the interband transition, we show that the massless band dispersion can instead be conveniently perceived by the room temperature study of the intraband transition through the determination of the plasmon carrier density relationship. We found the plasma frequency in MCT scales with the cube root of carrier density, in contrast with the square root scaling in the conventional massive fermion system of parabolic band dispersion. This work also answers the curious question of whether the MCT can maintain its massless Kane fermion character in case the strict gapless condition is deviated from. The method presented herein provides a convenient approach to identifying the landscape of both massless and massive band dispersion.</p>

            <h2>Shift current in 2D Janus Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: the role of excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuncheng Mao, Ju Zhou, Myrta Grüning, Claudio Attaccalite</p>
            <p>We study the shift current in two two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum diselenide (MoSSe) and tungsten diselenide (WSSe). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, in which the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This approach incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence of C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is shifted thus giving rise to a significant photocurrent. These results highlight the role played by excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate that these materials are promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <p>Kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) has emerged as an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and other quantum states. Among the three compounds, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a notably lower superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) at ambient pressure, posing challenges in exploring the superconducting state. For instance, the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) is small and thus difficult to measure accurately against other control parameters. Hence, enhancing superconductivity would facilitate $H_{c2}$ measurements, providing insights into key superconducting properties such as the dimensionality. In this letter, we report the tuning of the $T_c$ in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the application of biaxial strain. Utilizing a negative thermal expansion material ZrW$_2$O$_8$ as a substrate, we achieve a substantial biaxial strain of $\epsilon=1.50\%$, resulting in a remarkable 75\% enhancement in $T_c$. We investigate the $H_{c2}$ as a function of temperature, revealing a transition from multi-band to single-band superconductivity with increasing tensile strain. Additionally, we study the $H_{c2}$ as a function of field angle, revealing a plausible correlation between the $T_c$ enhancement and the change in dimensionality of the superconductivity under tensile strain. Further analysis quantitatively illustrates a transition towards two-dimensional superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when subjected to tensile strain. Our work demonstrates that the application of biaxial strain allows for the tuning of both the $T_c$ and superconducting dimensionality in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <p>Interfacial interactions often promote the emergence of unusual phenomena in two-dimensional systems, including high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of full-gap superconductivity with a maximal spectroscopic temperature up to 26 K in a BaAs monolayer grown on ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (abbreviated as BFCA) epitaxial films. The superconducting gap remains robust even when the thickness of underlying BFCA is reduced to the monolayer limit, in contrast to the rapid suppression of $T_\textrm{c}$ in standalone BFCA thin films. We reveal that the exceptional crystallinity of the BaAs/BFCA heterostructures, featured by their remarkable electronic and geometric uniformities, is crucial for the emergent full-gap superconductivity with mean-field temperature dependence and pronounced bound states within magnetic vortices. Our findings open up new avenues to unravel the mysteries of unconventional superconductivity in ferropnictides and advance the development of FeAs-based heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Zhang, Ming Qin, Yanqiu Sun, Siyuan Hong, Yanwu Xie</p>
            <p>The coexistence of superconductivity and ferroelectricity is rare due to their conflicting requirements: superconductivity relies on free charge carriers, whereas ferroelectricity typically occurs in insulating systems. At LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces, we demonstrate the coexistence of two-dimensional superconductivity and ferroelectricity, enabled by the unique properties of KTaO3 as a quantum paraelectric. Systematic gating and poling experiments reveal a universal enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) by 0.2-0.6 K and bistable transport properties, including hysteresis, strongly suggesting the existence of switchable ferroelectric polarization in the interfacial conducting layer. Hysteresis loops indicate robust ferroelectricity below 50 K. The Tc enhancement is attributed to ferroelectric polarization-induced reduction in dielectric constant, which narrows the interfacial potential well, confining carriers closer to the interface. The bistability arises from switchable ferroelectric polarization, which modulates the potential well depending on polarization direction. These findings establish a straightforward mechanism coupling ferroelectricity and superconductivity, providing a promising platform for exploring their interplay.</p>

            <h2>Endoreversible Stirling cycles: plasma engines at maximal power</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Behrendt, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics. We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles, for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.</p>

            <p>Quantum turbulence shares many similarities with classical turbulence in the isotropic and homogeneous case, despite the inviscid and quantized nature of its vortices. However, when quantum fluids are subjected to rotation, their turbulent dynamics depart significantly from the classical expectations. We explore the phenomenology of rotating quantum turbulence, emphasizing how rotation introduces new regimes with no classical analogs. We review recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical developments, and present new numerical results that map out distinct dynamical regimes arising from the interplay of rotation, quantization, non-linearities, and condensed matter regimes. In particular, we show the importance of distinguishing the dynamics of rotating quantum fluids in the slowly rotating, rapidly rotating, and low Landau level regimes. The findings have implications for the dynamics of liquid helium, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and neutron stars, and show how rotating quantum fluids can serve as a unique platform bridging turbulence theory and condensed matter physics revealing novel states of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giniyat Khaliullin, Jiří Chaloupka</p>
            <p>We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.</p>

Such a level structure is supported by square-planar coordination of nickel ions or a suitable substitution of apical oxygens. We construct the corresponding singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.</p>

            <p>We investigate the orbitally resolved superconducting properties of bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the spectral weights of both the large $\Delta_1$ and small $\Delta_2$ superconducting gaps remain nearly unchanged at the top Se sites as the STM tip approaches atomic contact. In contrast, the spectral weight of $\Delta_2$ increases significantly at the Fe and bottom Se sites. These results suggest that the gap $\Delta_2$ is localized in the xy-plane and likely associated with the dxy orbital band. Furthermore, we observe a long-range suppression of the large gap $\Delta_1$ near one-dimensional (1D) defects such as twin boundaries, wrinkles, and step edges, whereas $\Delta_2$ remains robust. This indicates that the two superconducting gaps respond differently to such 1D defects. High-resolution measurement using a Pb-coated tip reveals localized in-gap states near 1D defects, indicating possible defect-induced magnetism. Our findings highlight the contrasting behaviors of gap $\Delta_1$ and gap $\Delta_2$ in response to local electronic and magnetic environments and provide real-space evidence for orbital-selective superconductivity.</p>

We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.</p>

Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</p>

At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</p>

            <p>The jamming transition between flow and amorphous-solid states exhibits paradoxical properties characterized by hyperuniformity (suppressed spatial fluctuations) and criticality (hyperfluctuations), whose origin remains unclear. Here we model the jamming transition by a topological satisfiability transition in a minimum network model with simultaneously hyperuniform distributions of contacts, diverging length scales and scale-free clusters. We show that these phenomena stem from isostaticity and mechanical stability: the former imposes a global equality, and the latter local inequalities on arbitrary sub-systems. This dual constraint bounds contact number fluctuations from both above and below, limiting them to scale with the surface area. The hyperuniform and critical exponents of the network model align with those of frictionless jamming, suggesting a new universality class of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Our results provide a minimal, dynamics-independent framework for jamming criticality and hyperuniformity in disordered systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and iii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.</p>

In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class.

            <h2>Lattice-dependent orientational order in active crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Till Welker, Ricard Alert</p>
            <p>Via mechanisms not accessible at equilibrium, self-propelled particles can form phases with positional order, such as crystals, and with orientational order, such as polar flocks. However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice.</p>

            <h2>Mixed phases in a Fermi--Hubbard model describing altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Langmann, J. Lenells</p>
            <p>We study an extension of the 2D Fermi--Hubbard model, which was recently introduced in [Das et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernhard E. Lüscher, Mark H. Fischer</p>
            <p>Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p>

            <p>We report the creation of an ultracold gas of bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules. We first demonstrate a cooling strategy relying on sympathetic cooling of $^{133}$Cs to produce an ultracold mixture. From this mixture, weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about 130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.</p>

            <p>We show that for a standard continuously-polydisperse model with particle-diameter distribution $P(\sigma) \propto \sigma^{-3}$ and polydispersity index $\Delta$, employing a combination of standard SWAP moves and transient degree of freedom (TDOF) moves during a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like particle-growth process dramatically increases the generated packings' jamming densities $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\Delta)$, for a wide range of $\Delta$. We find that the fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing crystallization or fractionation. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 96% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 154%.</p>

            <h2>Thin active nematohydrodynamic layers: asymptotic theories and instabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehrana R. Nejad</p>
            <p>Starting from a three-dimensional description of an active nematic layer, we employ an asymptotic theory to derive a series of low-dimensional continuum models that capture the coupled dynamics of flat and curved films, including variations in film thickness, shape deformations, internal velocity fields, and the dynamics of orientational order. Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.</p>

This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected.

            <h2>Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model: Insights from entanglement entropy and role of short-range spatial correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankur Majumder, Sudeshna Sen</p>
            <p>The Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition is a paradigmatic phenomenon where Coulomb interactions between electrons drive a metal-insulator phase transition. It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.</p>

            <p>Modulating liquid-to-solid transitions and the resulting crystalline structure for tailored properties is much desired. Colloidal systems are exemplary to this end, but the fundamental knowledge gaps in relating the influence of intermolecular interactions to crystallization behavior continue to hinder progress. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by studying nucleation and growth in systems with modified Lennard-Jones potential. Specifically, we study the commonly used 12-6 potential and a softer 7-6 potential. The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both systems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under these conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is comparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal structures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur predominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the critical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways. One pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement. Our study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through modifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation kinetics. The results have significant implications in designing approaches for polymorph selection and modulating self-assembly mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and non-volatile memory with great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge devices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical properties, such as the effective anisotropy field ($H_{\rm{k,eff}}$, related to magnetic stability) and damping ($\alpha$ key factor in device energy efficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for designing and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced metrology techniques, Time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) stands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing traditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). However, the full potential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully pledged due to the lack of systematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we address this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for optimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our work identifies the optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal amplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to $H_{\rm{k,eff}}$ and $\alpha$. By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting sensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract magnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization framework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics, paving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine the landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.</p>

            <p>CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ has the paradox that low temperature static magnetic order is incompatible with the crystal structure owing to a mirror plane that exactly frustrates magnetic interactions. Despite no observable structural distortion with diffraction, CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ does magnetically order below $T_{\rm N}$ $\sim$ 25 K with the breaking of spin ground state degeneracy proposed to be a realization of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in analogy to the celebrated orbital Jahn-Teller transition. We apply neutron and Raman spectroscopy to study the dynamics of this transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$. We find anomalous acoustics associated with a symmetry breaking strain that characterizes the spin Jahn-Teller transition. Crucially, the energy of this phonon coincides with the energy scale of the magnetic excitations, and has the same symmetry of an optic mode, observed with Raman spectroscopy, which atypically softens in energy with decreasing temperature. Taken together, we propose that the energetics of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ are related to cooperative magnetoelastic fluctuations as opposed to conventional soft critical dynamics which typically drive large measurable static displacements.</p>

            <p>The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Here we present an experimentally practical and robust method to compute the transient extensional viscosity from exponential shear on a wide variety of viscoelastic complex fluids. To achieve this, we derive an analytical, frame-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function, valid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original framework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect of rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern strain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain rates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and up to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to observe finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the kinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations of the method, establishing firm windows of data validity. The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids. We show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of producing "strong flow" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with coil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in extensional flows (Wi > 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach finite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then quantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional extensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using the same PIB solution. Questions related to generality of this approach are addressed, including discussions on multi-mode relaxation and shear thinning.</p>

            <p>AlN has the largest bandgap in the wurtzite III-nitride semiconductor family, making it an ideal barrier for a thin GaN channel to achieve strong carrier confinement in field-effect transistors, analogous to silicon-on-insulator technology. Unlike SiO$_2$/Si/SiO$_2$, AlN/GaN/AlN can be grown fully epitaxially, enabling high carrier mobilities suitable for high-frequency applications. However, developing these heterostructures and related devices has been hindered by challenges in strain management, polarization effects, defect control and charge trapping. Here, the AlN single-crystal high electron mobility transistor (XHEMT) is introduced, a new nitride transistor technology designed to address these issues. The XHEMT structure features a pseudomorphic GaN channel sandwiched between AlN layers, grown on single-crystal AlN substrates. First-generation XHEMTs demonstrate RF performance on par with the state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs, achieving 5.92 W/mm output power and 65% peak power-added efficiency at 10 GHz under 17 V drain bias. These devices overcome several limitations present in conventional GaN HEMTs, which are grown on lattice-mismatched foreign substrates that introduce undesirable dislocations and exacerbated thermal resistance. With the recent availability of 100-mm AlN substrates and AlN's high thermal conductivity (340 W/m$\cdot$K), XHEMTs show strong potential for next-generation RF electronics.</p>

            <p>Chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides, including complex chalcogenides and transition metal dichalcogenides, are emerging semiconductors with direct or indirect band gaps within the visible spectrum. These materials are being explored for various photonic and electronic applications, such as photodetectors, photovoltaics, and phase-change electronics. Understanding the fundamental properties of these materials is crucial for optimizing their functionalities. Therefore, the availability of large, high-quality single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides is essential for a better comprehension of their structure and properties. In this study, we present a novel crystal growth method that utilizes the exchange reaction between BaS and ZrCl$_4$/ HfCl$_4$. By carefully controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the binary sulfide to the chloride, we can grow single crystals of several materials, such as ZrS$_2$, HfS$_2$, BaZrS$_3$, and ZrOS. This method results in large single crystals with a short reaction time of 24 to 48 hours. High-resolution thin film diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirm the quality of the crystals produced through this exchange reaction. We also report the optical properties of these materials investigated using photoluminescence and Raman measurements. The chloride exchange reaction method paves the way for the synthesis of single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenide systems with a short reaction time but with low mosaicity and can be an alternative growth technique for single crystals of materials that are difficult to synthesize using conventional growth techniques.</p>

            <p>We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>A recent experiment [Son et al., Soft Matter, 2024, 20,2777-2788] showed that self-propelled particles confined within a circular boundary filled with granular medium spontaneously form a motile cluster that stays on the boundary. This cluster exhibits persistent (counter)clockwise motion driven by symmetry breaking, which arises from a positive feedback between the asymmetry of the cluster and those of the surrounding granular medium. To investigate this symmetry-breaking mechanism in broader contexts, we propose and analyze the dynamics of an active hinge moving through a crowded two-dimensional channel. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the lifetime of the hinge's motile state varies nonmonotonically with both the packing fraction of the granular medium and the strength of self-propulsion. Furthermore, we observe an abrupt transition in the configuration of passive particles that sustain hinge motility as the hinge's maximum angle relative to the channel wall increases. These findings point to the possibility of designing superstructures composed of passive granular media doped with a small number of active elements, whose dynamics modes can be switched by tuning the properties of their components.</p>

We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Cyclic Tensile Properties of Fluids with Composite Harmonic Exponential Waveforms (CHEW)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.A. Kroo, R.A. Nicholson, M.W Boehm, S.K. Baier, P.A. Underhill, G.H. McKinley</p>
            <p>Building off recent advances on how to practically use exponential shear in a torsional rheometer to compute transient planar extensional viscosity (Kroo et al. 2025a), we extend the technique to cyclic tensile measurements in complex fluids and soft solids. An novel input strain waveform provides a unifying approach that smoothly interpolates between exponential shear (ES) and oscillatory shear (SAOS/MAOS/LAOS) as a flow type parameter is varied. Analogous to cyclic tensile fatigue tests in solids, or the process of chewing in the oral cavity, this complex strain history is used to quantify the evolution of extensional material properties at large strains over sequential cycles of stretch. In the limit of large Hencky strain rates, the waveform locally increases exponentially and generates a period of strong material stretching. This allows for the direct computation of a transient planar extensional viscosity within specific domains of the periodic function. We demonstrate this technique on a set of model fluids, and then apply it to complex multiphase materials that mutate. These latter fluids exhibit progressive evolution in their rheological properties over repeated cycles of extensional deformation. Here we focus on two examples: a delicate foodstuff material (melted provolone cheese) which systematically decreases its extensional response over successive stretching cycles, mutating at a rate that is directly dependent on the effective Hencky strain rate. We contrast this with a PVA-borax solution which exhibits precisely the opposite effect during successive stretching cycles: increasing its planar extensional response over successive cycles, as interchain associative interactions (controlled via stretching) build structure within the fluid. These results highlight a promising new approach to study bulk extensional properties during cyclical stretching of complex fluids.</p>

            <h2>Giant Magneto-Optical Effects in Two-Dimensional Flat-Band Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Yang, Wanxiang Feng, Siyuan Liu, Shan Guan, Liwei Wen, Wei Jiang, Gui-Bin Liu, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>In this work, we reveal giant magneto-optical responses in two-dimensional(2D) antiferromagnets with nearly flat electronic bands, based on first-principles calculations and group-theoretical analysis. We identify a record-large second-order magneto-optical Schafer-Hubert(SH) effect, featuring a polarization rotation angle of 28 degree, in monolayer antiferromagnetic RuOCl2, driven by flatband-enhanced interband optical transitions. Both the valence and conduction bands exhibit pronounced directional flatness, giving rise to highly anisotropic optical absorption and broadband hyperbolic frequency windows spanning the entire visible spectrum. This anisotropy leads to an exceptionally strong linear dichroism (LD) reaching 50%, far exceeding values reported in other 2D magnetic systems. Remarkably, the giant SH effect and LD appear at distinct photon energies, reflecting a momentum-direction-dependent crossover between flat and dispersive bands. Both responses are further amplified with increasing RuOCl2 film thickness. Our results establish flat-band antiferromagnets as a fertile platform for realizing giant nonlinear magneto-optical effects and open new avenues for 2D opto-spintronic device applications.</p>

            <p>For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well, such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, a Schottky-gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky-gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. Here, we used a ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway to improve performance in transistors based on 2DEG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siya Zhu, Doguhan Sariturk, Raymundo Arroyave</p>
            <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their unique structural and functional properties. In the study of HEAs, thermodynamic properties and phase stability play a crucial role, making phase diagram calculations significantly important. However, phase diagram calculations with conventional CALPHAD assessments based on experimental or ab-initio data can be expensive. With the emergence of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we have developed a program named PhaseForge, which integrates MLIPs into the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) framework using our MLIP calculation library, MaterialsFramework, to enable efficient exploration of alloy phase diagrams. Moreover, our workflow can also serve as a benchmarking tool for evaluating the quality of different MLIPs.</p>

            <p>Skyrmions, originally from condensed matter physics, have been widely explored in various physical systems, including soft matter. A crucial challenge in manipulating topological solitary waves like skyrmions is controlling their flow on demand. Here, we control the arbitrary moving direction of skyrmions in a chiral liquid crystal system by adjusting the bias of the applied alternate current electric field. Specifically, the velocity, including both moving direction and speed can be continuously changed. The motion control of skyrmions originates from the symmetry breaking of the topological structure induced by flexoelectric-polarization effect. The omnidirectional control of topological solitons opens new avenues in light-steering and racetrack memories.</p>

            <h2>Non-collinear magnetism contra frustration: Magnetic order and anisotropy in hexagonal MnPtGa</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerhard H. Fecher, Roshnee Sahoo, Claudia Felser</p>
            <p>MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Topological characterization of magnon-polaron bands and thermal Hall conductivity in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have not been addressed in the literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in a non-collinear antiferromagnet via two different kinds of coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their macroscopic origin. In the case of a local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytical approach through a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons, that renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes and yields a magnon-polaron quasiparticle state. In both the coupling regimes, the robust support of the topological signatures is derived systematically from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we witness transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity, which aid in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.</p>

            <h2>Electron-phonon coupling in Kekulé-ordered graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Szczȩśniak</p>
            <p>Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekulé-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekulé bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.</p>

            <p>We derive an effective field theory for a noncollinear altermagnet and magnons on top of the noncollinear ground state from an altermagnetic Heisenberg model. We obtain the ground-state phase diagram, revealing a noncollinear phase and four distinct collinear phases. The ground state of the noncollinear phase fully breaks the spin rotational symmetry, while the ground state of the collinear phases possesses unbroken $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry. The resulting effective field theory for the noncollinear phase is an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ sigma model in which the magnonic excitation has three independent degrees of freedom and exhibits the $d$-wave-like anisotropic linear dispersion. We also discuss possible topological solitons, including $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.</p>

            <p>The structural distortions, orbital correlations, and electronic states in cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) were investigated using complementary characterisation techniques, including SR-XRD, HAXPES, XANES, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. SR-XRD confirms phase purity and reveals a temperature-dependent superlattice reflection between 200 K and 100 K, consistent with the emergence of short-range orbital ordering driven by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion (JTD). The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing and the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet splitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core levels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES analysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions. Temperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local disorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by enhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation redistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily affecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100 K) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports these findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in the same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation and exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour. Together, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly involving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence, and orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.</p>

            <p>This communication presents an examination of a two-dimensional, non-Hermitian Su -Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is differentiated from its conventional Hermitian counterpart by incorporating gain and/or loss terms, mathematically represented by imaginary on-site potentials. The time-reversal symmetry is disrupted due to these on-site potentials. Exceptional points in a non-Hermitian system feature eigenvalue coalescence and non-trivial eigenvector degeneracies. Utilization of the rank-nullity theorem and graphical analysis of the phase rigidity factor enable identification of true exceptional points. Furthermore, this investigation achieves vectorized Zak phase quantization and examines a topolectric RLC circuit to derive the corresponding topological boundary resonance condition and the quantum Hall susceptance. Although Chern number quantization is not feasible, staggered hopping amplitudes corresponding to unit-cell lattice sites lead to broken inversion symmetry with non-zero Berry curvature, resulting in finite anomalous Nernst conductivity.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetism and superconductivity can lead to intriguing emergent phenomena. Here we combine two different two-dimensional antiferromagnetic magnet-superconductor hybrids (MSH) and study their properties using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Both MSHs show the characteristics of a topological nodal point superconducting phase with edge modes to the trivial substrate superconductor. At the boundary between the two MSHs we find low-energy modes which are spin-polarized. Based on a tight-binding model we can explain the experimental observations by considering two different topological nodal point superconductors. This gives rise to spin-polarized chiral edge modes that connect topological nodal points of the two different MSH. We demonstrate via the complex band structure that due to an asymmetric lateral decay these edge modes are spin-polarized, regardless of the details of the spin structure at the boundary. The presence of spin-polarized edge states between different topological superconductors enables advanced functional design for the exploitation of MSHs as a platform for topology-based applications.</p>

            <p>Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.</p>

By introducing conditional boundary conditions (CBCs) for non-Hermitian quantum systems, we explore a winding-control mechanism that selectively collapses specific periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra onto their open boundary condition (OBC) counterparts, guided by their specific winding numbers, together with a composite reconstruction of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). The corresponding eigenstates also manifest nontrivial skin effects or extended behaviors arising from the interplay between BZ and GBZ structures. Furthermore, we can generalize our control by incorporating similarity transformations and holomorphic mappings with the boundary controls. We demonstrate the winding control numerically within various models, which enriches our knowledge of non-Hermitian physics across the spectrum, topology, and bulk-boundary correspondence.</p>

The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p>

            <p>Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</p>

            <p>Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$) bilayer films (YHO/MoO$_3$) are produced using reactive magnetron sputtering, and their photochromic properties are investigated in relation to the thickness and density of the MoO$_3$ layer. Compared to single YHO films, the YHO/MoO$_3$ films exhibit faster coloration and larger contrast, with both parameters adjustable by varying the thickness or deposition pressure of the MoO$_3$ layer. Transparent YHO/MoO$_3$ films (~75% at 550 nm) demonstrate a photochromic contrast of up to 60%, significantly higher than the 25-30% contrast observed for single YHO films after 20 hours of UVA-violet light exposure. This enhancement arises from hydrogen intercalation from the (200)-textured polycrystalline YHO film into the X-ray amorphous MoO$_3$, leading to the formation of molybdenum bronze (HxMoO$_3$), as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopies. However, the darkened YHO/MoO$_3$ films do not fully recover to their initial transparency after illumination due to the irreversible nature of the coloured MoO$_3$ layer. Most of the hydrogen intercalated into MoO$_3$ originates from the YHO layer during the initial darkening process. Furthermore, the bilayer films are chemically unstable, exhibiting gradual darkening over time even without intentional UV illumination, as confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis.</p>

            <p>Topological Josephson junctions enable nonreciprocal transport involving Majorana fermions (MFs). Here we examine a topological Josephson junction with mixed $s$+$p$-wave pairing, where topological phase transition can be driven by adjusting the ratio between the pairing components. There exist two exact symmetrically positioned zero-energy level crossings for the Andreev-bound states, which can be shifted by external fields, and can be destroyed or recreated in pairs by a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field or inhomogeneities, exhibiting band-like structure. The dependence of the shift on the Zeeman field is linear when the two $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors on both sides are identical while quadratic when they are distinct. Near the topological phase transition, the topological $p$-wave dominant junctions host MF-induced pronounced superconducting diode effect with high efficiency factor $Q$ up to 30 %, in contrast to the trivial $s$-wave dominant junctions possessing relatively small $Q$.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</p>

            <p>Heterogeneous nucleation at surface edges is pervasive across nature and industry, yet the role of line tension, arising from asymmetric capillary interactions at geometric singularities, remains poorly understood. Herein we develop a generalized nucleation theory that explicitly incorporates line tension induced by edge pinning, thereby extending classical frameworks to account for nanoscale confinement and interfacial asymmetry. Through analytical treatment of droplet formation within geometrically defined nanopores, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge-pinned line tension as a function of Laplace pressure, pore geometry, and wettability. This formulation reveals that line tension can significantly reshape the nucleation energy landscape, introducing nontrivial dependencies on contact angle and pore morphology. Our results uncover a tunable, geometry-mediated mechanism for controlling nucleation barriers, offering predictive insight into phase transitions in confined environments and suggesting new strategies for design in applications ranging from nanofluidics to crystallization control.</p>

We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</p>

            <h2>Simulating Correlated Electrons with Symmetry-Enforced Normalizing Flows</h2>

            <p>We present the first proof of principle that normalizing flows can accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution of the fermionic Hubbard model - a key framework for describing the electronic structure of graphene and related materials. State-of-the-art methods like Hybrid Monte Carlo often suffer from ergodicity issues near the time-continuum limit, leading to biased estimates. Leveraging symmetry-aware architectures as well as independent and identically distributed sampling, our approach resolves these issues and achieves significant speed-ups over traditional methods.</p>
