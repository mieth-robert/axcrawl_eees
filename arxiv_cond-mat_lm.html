            <h2>Anomalous Transport In Low Dimension Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Lopes</p>
            <p>This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iskandar Raufov, Dilshod Nematov, Saidjafar Murodzoda, Sakhidod Sattorzoda, Anushervon Ashurov</p>
            <p>This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</p>

            <h2>Interface Modeling of Perovskite Polymer Heterostructures for Enhanced Charge Transfer Efficiency in Hybrid Photovoltaic Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somayyeh Alidoust, V. Ongun Özçelik</p>
            <p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Twisted Trilayer Graphene, Quasiperiodic Superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinghai Zhang, Ziyan Zhu, Justin H. Wilson, Matthew S. Foster</p>
            <p>Twisted multilayer moiré materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moiré scale due to the interference of different misaligned moiré periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.</p>

            <h2>A scanning probe microscopy approach for identifying defects in aluminum oxide</h2>

            <p>The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-induced electronic degeneracy breaking: a SSAdNDP interpretation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javiera Cabezas-Escares, Andrea Echeverri, Francisco Muñoz, Anastassia N. Alexandrova</p>
            <p>This work explores how phonon perturbations can induce the breaking of electronic degeneracies near the Fermi level and how this response can be interpreted from a chemical perspective through the SSAdNDP method. We apply this approach to a family of structurally similar yet electronically distinct hexagonal materials-MgB2, graphene, and hBN-to analyze how a single phonon mode simultaneously modifies the electronic structure (band dispersion) and the nature of chemical bonding (natural occupations and nodal patterns) in real space. Our results show that band splitting becomes physically relevant only when it is accompanied by an electronic redistribution, reflected in changes of the occupation numbers or bonding topology. Thus, SSAdNDP provides a direct bridge between reciprocal- and real-space representations, translating phenomena such as electron-phonon coupling into chemically intuitive reorganizations of multicenter bonds, and offering a unified framework to interpret vibrationally driven electronic effects in solids.</p>

            <h2>Kitaev interaction and possible spin liquid state in CoI2 and Co2/3Mg1/3I2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaozhenghang Ma, Ke Yang, Yuxuan Zhou, Hua Wu</p>
            <p>Kitaev materials are of great interest due to their potential in realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and applications in topological quantum computing. In the pursuit of realizing Kitaev QSL, a Mott insulator with strong bond-dependent frustration and weak geometric frustration is highly desirable. Here we explore Kitaev physics in the van der Waals triangular antiferromagnet (AF) CoI$_2$, through the spin-orbital states and Wannier function analyses, exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties. We find that the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ ion is in the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ state because of strong spin-orbit coupling, and the weak trigonal elongation and crystal field contribute to the observed weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The strong $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping via the strong Co 3$d$-I 5$p$ hybridization gives rise to a strong Kitaev interaction ($K_1$) at the first nearest neighbors (1NN), and the long Co-Co distance and the weak $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hoppings determine a weak Heisenberg interaction $J_1$. The resultant $|K_1/J_1|$ = 6.63 confirms a strong bond-dependent frustration, while the geometric frustration due to the 3NN Heisenberg interaction $J_3$ gets involved, and they all together result in the experimental helical AF order in CoI$_2$. We then propose to suppress the $J_3$ using a partial Mg substitution for Co, and indeed we find that Co$_{2/3}$Mg$_{1/3}$I$_2$ has the much reduced geometric frustration but hosts the robust bond-dependent frustration, and thus it would be a promising Kitaev material being so far closest to the QSL state.</p>

            <h2>Competing Trion and Exciton Dynamics in a Quasi-One-Dimensional Correlated Semiconductor</h2>

            <p>Strong Coulomb interactions in low-dimensional quantum materials give rise to emergent bound states such as excitons and trions, which play a central role in correlated electronic phases. In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons. These findings extend ultrafast quasiparticle photoemission spectroscopy to complex bound states in bulk quantum materials, enabling the dynamical control of charged and neutral excitations.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic field and pressure tuning of the heavy fermion antiferromagnet CePdIn</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Shen, Feng Du, Rui Li, Hang Su, Kazunori Umeo, Xin Lu, Toshiro Takabatake, Michael Smidman, Huiqiu Yuan</p>
            <p>Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\rm{M}} \approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure.</p>

            <h2>Fast collisional $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafi Weill, Jonathan Nemirovsky, Yoav Sagi</p>
            <p>Collisional gates in optical superlattices have recently achieved record fidelities, but their operation times are typically limited by tunneling. Here we propose and analyze an alternative route to a fast $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for two fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice based on optimized, time-dependent control of the short and long lattice depths. The gate is implemented by transiently releasing the atoms into a quasi-harmonic confinement centered between the two sites. With an appropriately chosen contact interaction strength, a controlled collision accumulates the exchange phase required for $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and generates entanglement. We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schrödinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\sim 21\,\mu\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\gtrsim 99\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration of Superconductor Shift Registers with Energy Dissipation Below Landauer's Thermodynamic Limit</h2>

            <p>We study energy dissipation and propagation of information encoded by Josephson vortices in two types of circular shift register: a) a uniform register composed of sections of discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL) forming a closed loop with a flux pump allowing to change the number of moving fluxon; b) a nonuniform register composed of sections of the regular JTL and sections of JTLs utilizing nSQUIDs - dc-SQUIDs with negative inductance between their arms - instead of single Josephson junctions. nSQUIDs are parametric devices with a flexible double-well potential that were proposed as components for reversible computing. For the uniform register, we demonstrate the energy dissipation per bit-shift operation below the Landauer's thermodynamic limit $E_T=k_BTln2$ up to propagation delays of ~0.7 ns, corresponding to the circular information motion with frequencies up to ~1.4 GHz. This does not contradict Landauer's minimum energy requirement for computations since information is not destroyed. For the nonuniform register, we find the minimum energy dissipation per bit-shift of about 16$E_T$ and attribute this to a nonuniform movement of vortices and energy barriers between the regular JTL and nSQUID sections. Differences of Josephson vortex propagation in both types of circular registers are discussed based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, extracted effective resistance and the terminal speed of Josephson vortices, and their dependences on the number of moving vorticies. nSQUID inductance connecting JJs to the ground leads to an unusual type of lossless discrete transmission line with frequency-dependent impedance and propagation speed, both different from the regular JTLs.</p>

            <h2>Giant-Magnetocaloric effect and phonon dynamics in (GdCe)CrO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravi Kiran Dokala (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden), Shaona Das (Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany), Subhash Thota (Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India)</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic ordering and phonon dynamics of the GdCrO$_3$ orthorhombic perovskite. The Ce doped compound exhibits long-range canted antiferromagnetism with Neel transitions, T$_N$ at $\sim$ 173 K, accompanied by spin-flip, T$_{SF}$ at $\sim$ 10 K. Ce$^{3+}$ incorporation drives a modification of the spin-flip transition from the $\Gamma{(G_x,A_y,F_z)}$ configuration to $\Gamma$ inducing a reorientation of the spin axis between the (001) and (001) crystallographic planes. This spin reorientation is governed by Zeeman energy and produces pronounced field-induced irreversibility between FCC and FCW magnetization processes. The substituted compound Gd$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (GCCO) exhibits a remarkably large magnetic entropy change, $\Delta$ S $\sim$ 45-40 J/kg-K for $\Delta$ H = 90-70 kOe at 3 K among the highest reported for rare-earth orthochromites. The interplay of spin-only magnetocrystalline anisotropy from Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit-driven magnetic moments of Gd$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ results in pronounced spin-phonon coupling, manifested through the A$_{1g}$(6) vibrational mode. The observed temperature-dependent spectral evolution is consistent with behaviour reported in isostructural magnetic perovskites.</p>

            <p>We report the influence of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic structures and phonon dynamics in SmCrO$_3$ perovskites. Magnetic landscapes are spanned by long-range canted anti-ferromagnetism, AFM with Neel temperatures $\sim$196 K accompanied by spin-reorientation transitions, T$_{SRPT}$ at 42 K. In Sm$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (SCCO), Ce$^{3+}$ substitution at Sm$^{3+}$ sites transform the weak ferromagnetic (FM) $\Gamma_4$ state into robust AFM $\Gamma_1$ configuration through a gradual crossover. Such coexistence of magnetic spin configurations $\Gamma_1$(AFM) to $\Gamma_4$ (WFM) results in the enhanced high coercive field and a pronounced exchange bias-field, $H_{\mathrm{EB}}$ $\sim$ 2 kOe. Spin-only driven magneto-crystalline anisotropy of Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit driven magnetic moment in Sm$^{3+}$, and Ce$^{3+}$ exhibits spin-phonon coupling through $A_{1g}(6)$ mode in SCCO are consistent with the temperature dependent spectral features of the isostructural magnetic systems and quite significant in SCCO which is in accordance with the higher structural distortion in SCCO. These results demonstrate that site-specific R$^{3+}$ substitution modulates lattice distortions, spin-phonon coupling, and spin-orbit interactions, offering pathways to optimize perovskites for diverse spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Fast and accurate Fe-H machine-learning interatomic potential for elucidating hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuma Ito</p>
            <p>Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.</p>

            <p>Topological magnetic textures are particle-like spin configurations stabilized by competing interactions. Their formation is commonly attributed to fluctuation-driven, first-order nucleation processes requiring activation over a topological energy barrier. Here, we demonstrate an alternative barrier- and fluctuation-free pathway for nucleating topological magnetic textures, triggered in our experiments by an excitation-induced spin reorientation transition. By combining x-ray imaging, scattering and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the system follows a deterministic cascade of symmetry-breaking phase transitions after excitation. First, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a homogeneous state to weak stripe domains, then a first-order transition to topologically trivial bubbles, and finally a topological switching event into skyrmionic textures. Through simulations, we generalize our findings and demonstrate that this pathway is active in a vast range of low-anisotropy materials. This previously unrecognized, spontaneous transition pathway suggests strategies for rapid, low-energy generation of topological spin textures and points to a general role of intrinsic modulational instabilities in phase transitions beyond magnetism.</p>

            <p>Inspired by previous works on epidemic-like processes in open quantum systems, we derive an elementary quantum epidemic model that is simple enough to be studied via Quantum Jump Monte Carlo simulations at reasonably large system sizes. We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection.</p>

We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.</p>

            <h2>Effects of electron-electron interaction and spin-orbit coupling on Andreev pair qubits in quantum dot Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teodor Iličin, Rok Žitko</p>
            <p>We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2\Delta$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.</p>

            <h2>Efficient population transfer in a quantum dot exciton under phonon-induced decoherence via shortcuts to adiabaticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Spyridon G. Kosionis, Sutirtha Biswas, Christina Fouseki, Dionisis Stefanatos, Emmanuel Paspalakis</p>
            <p>In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</p>

            <h2>A Simple and Efficient Non-DFT-Based Machine Learning Interatomic Potential to Simulate Titanium MXenes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis F. V. Thomazini, Alexandre F. Fonseca</p>
            <p>Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Topological Electronic Crystals in Bilayer Graphene--Mott Insulator Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wangqian Miao, Tianyu Qiao, Xue-Yang Song, Xi Dai</p>
            <p>We predict a new class of topological electronic crystals in bilayer graphene-Mott insulator heterostructures. Interlayer charge transfer creates a charge neutral electron hole bilayer, in which itinerant carriers in graphene interact attractively with localized carriers from a flat Hubbard band. In the heavy fermion limit and dilute limit, this interplay leads to symmetry breaking crystalline phases stabilized not only by pure repulsion, but also by interlayer Coulomb attraction shaped by band topology. Using comprehensive Hartree Fock calculations, we uncover triangular, honeycomb, and kagome charge orders hosting different quantized anomalous Hall effects at moderate interlayer attraction.</p>

            <h2>Phase transition revealed by eigen microstate entropy</h2>

            <p>We introduce the eigen microstate entropy ($S_{\text{EM}}$), a novel metric of complexity derived from the probabilities of statistically independent eigen microstates. After establishing its scaling behavior in equilibrium systems and demonstrating its utility in critical phenomena (mean spherical, Ising, and Potts models), we apply $S_{\text{EM}}$ to non-equilibrium complex systems. Our analysis reveals a consistent precursor signal: a significant increase in $S_{\text{EM}}$ precedes major phase transitions. Specifically, we observe this entropy rise before biomolecular condensate formation in liquid-liquid phase separation in living cells and months ahead of El Niño events. These findings position $S_{\text{EM}}$ as a general framework for detecting and interpreting phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Compositional and Oxygen-Vacancy Effects on Phase Stability and Electronic Properties in Ceria-Based Lanthanide High-Entropy Oxides</h2>

            <p>Cerium-based lanthanide high-entropy oxides (LN-HEOs) are promising candidates for solid-state electrolyte (mass transport) applications due to their ability to accommodate high concentrations of oxygen vacancies while retaining a fluorite-derived structure. However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-\delta}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the mechanisms of supported lipid membrane reshaping into tubular networks using quantitative DIC microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Regan, Paola Borri, Wolfgang Langbein</p>
            <p>Biological membranes are known to form various structural motifs, from lipid bilayers to tubular filaments and networks facilitating e.g. adhesion and cell-cell communication. To understand the biophysical processes underpinning lipid-lipid interactions in these systems, synthetic membrane models are crucial. Here, we demonstrate the formation of tubular networks from supported lipid membranes of controlled lipid composition on glass. We quantify tube radii using quantitative differential interference contrast (qDIC) and propose a biophysical mechanism for the formation of these structures, regulated by surface tension and lipid exchange with connected supported membranes. Two lipid types are investigated, namely DOPC and DC15PC, exhibiting a liquid disordered and a solid ordered phase at room temperature, respectively. Tube formation is studied versus temperature, revealing bilamellar layers retracting and folding into tubes upon DC15PC lipids transitioning from liquid to solid phase, which is explained by lipid transfer from bilamellar to unilamellar layers. This study introduces a novel model system for bilayer tubes, allowing to elucidate the biophysics of lipid-lipid interactions governing lipid membrane reshaping into tubular structures, important for our understanding of biological membrane filaments.</p>

            <h2>The Geometric Foundations of Microcanonical Thermodynamics: Entropy Flow Equation and Thermodynamic Equivalence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Loris Di Cairano</p>
            <p>We develop a geometric foundation of microcanonical thermodynamics in which entropy and its derivatives are determined from the geometry of phase space, rather than being introduced through an a priori ensemble postulate. Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy. Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^\alpha$ interactions.</p>

            <h2>Survey on Lattice Gas Models on 2D Lattices: Critical Behavior of Closed Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoey Zhou</p>
            <p>Lorentz lattice gases (LLGs) are discrete-time transport models in which a point particle moves ballistically between lattice sites and is scattered by randomly placed, quenched local scatterers such as ``rotators'' or ``mirrors.'' Despite the elementary update rules, LLGs exhibit rich dynamical regimes: typically, trajectories close quickly and the distribution of loop lengths has exponential tails, but at special concentrations of scatterers one observes critical behavior with scale-free statistics and fractal geometry. This survey focuses on the critical behavior of closed trajectories in two-dimensional LLGs, starting from the numerical study of Cao and Cohen, and its relation to percolation-hull scaling and kinetic hull-generating walks. We highlight the scaling hypothesis for loop-length distributions, the emergence of critical exponents $\tau=15/7$, $d_f=7/4$, and $\sigma=3/7$ in several universality classes, and the appearance of alternative exponents in partially occupied models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianxin Yu, Kun Yang, Jiawen Li, Sheng Meng, Xinghua Shi, Jin Zhang</p>
            <p>We demonstrate anisotropic photostriction in two-dimensional orthorhombic semiconductors using time-dependent density functional theory. By tracing the dynamics of photoexcited carriers, we establish a quantitative link between carrier density and lattice deformation in layered black phosphorus and germanium selenides. The structural response exhibits significant anisotropy, featuring lattice expansion along the armchair direction and contraction along the zigzag direction, which is attributed to the interplay between charge redistribution and intrinsic lattice anisotropy. Both the magnitude and orientation of the photostrictive strains can be tuned by photodoping densities, enabling precise control over the photoinduced response. Notably, the photoinduced strains significantly increase carrier recombination lifetimes by suppressing nonradiative recombination, primarily due to the enlarged bandgap and weakened nonadiabatic coupling. These results provide microscopic insight into the origin of anisotropic photostriction in low-dimensional systems and lay the groundwork for light-controllable, directionally sensitive optomechanical devices at the atomic scale.</p>

By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Hayoun, Ilya A. Gruzberg, Marcel Filoche</p>
            <p>We introduce a conceptual reformulation of the Mott-Berezinskiĭ (MB) theory of low-frequency AC conductivity in disordered systems based on localization landscape theory. Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets demonstrate significant potential in spintronics due to their unique non-relativistic spin-splitting properties, yet altermagnetic devices still face challenges in efficiently switching logic states. Here, we report electrostatically controllable spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO and design a dual-gate altermagnetic tunnel junction (AMTJ), which can switch between high and low resistance states without switching the Néel vector. First-principles calculations demonstrate that vertical electric field can induce significant spin splitting in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Reversing the electric field direction can alter the spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Leveraging this electric-field-tunable spin splitting, the dual-gate AMTJ exhibits an ultrahigh tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of $10^{7}$. This work provides theoretical support for the design of fully electrically controlled AMTJs and demonstrates their great potential for applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions.</p>

            <p>The interplay between laser parameters and liquid environments dictates the outcome of femtosecond laser-induced nanoparticle modification. We present a study of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles in water and a water-acetone mixture, irradiated with femtosecond lasers at 808 nm and 404 nm. While aggregation was observed in pure water at both wavelengths, the results revealed a strong stability and a rather unexpected wavelength-dependency in the acetone-water mixture. In this case, 808 nm irradiation produced some decrease in nanoparticle sizes, while 404 nm led to some nanoparticle growth. As a result, the acetone effect is found to be twofold: (i) on one hand, it helps to prevent aggregation; (ii) on the other hand, it acts as a reactive medium allowing to tune the nanoparticle size and composition simply by changing laser wavelength. So, this work emphasizes that solvent physical properties as well as laser-induced chemical processes in the solvent are not merely secondary effects but can dominate the final morphological outcome, providing a predictive framework for nanoparticle synthesis.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities to realize emergent phenomena by reducing dimensionality. Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder.</p>

            <p>The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D sheet of gold exfoliated from $Ti_3AuC_2$, offers high specific surface area (~260 $m^2g^{-1}$), roughly twice that of fine nanodots (~100 $m^2g^{-1}$), and unique electronic properties due to its dense d-orbital. In this work, we investigate the adsorption of single atom catalyst (SAC) of hydrogen atom on pristine goldene (pG), monovacant goldene (vG), and sulfur-functionalized variants (thiol-pG and thiol-vG) using ab initio calculations. The adsorption energy of a single H atom and $\Delta G_H$, determines the efficiency of the Volmer step of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and is a key descriptor for HER activity. We explore various potential sites for H adsorption and its impact on descriptors such as Bader charges, d-band shift and the exchange current density.</p>

            <p>Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Bauschinger to Bauschinger Crossover under Steady Shear in Amorphous Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rashmi Priya, Smarajit Karmakar</p>
            <p>Directional memory in amorphous solids is commonly quantified through the Bauschinger effect, yet the observation of the inverse Bauschinger effect suggests that the sign of memory can invert, pointing to distinct underlying plastic organization. Here, we connect directional memory to the nature of yielding in steadily sheared amorphous solids. Using simulations of two-dimensional polydisperse glasses, we show that the type of directional memory (Bauschinger versus inverse Bauschinger) is jointly controlled by deformation history, strain rate, and parent temperature. We identify a critical history amplitude $\gamma_{N,\mathrm{crit}}(T_p,\dot{\gamma})$ and construct a phase diagram that delineates regimes with memory inversion from those showing only conventional Bauschinger response. Microscopically, memory inversion correlates with network-like shear-band morphology and plastic healing, whereas conventional memory is associated with persistent localization and cumulative damage. These results establish directional memory as an order parameter for a shear-rate and annealing-controlled brittle-ductile crossover and suggest that plastic healing provides a generic route to memory inversion in disordered solids.</p>

            <p>Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Delzescaux, D. Mouhanna</p>
            <p>We investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach, following the pioneering work of Mauri et al. [Phys. Rev. B 102, 165421 (2020)] based on a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA). We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim \ell^{2}(\lambda+2\mu)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim 2\kappa$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations.</p>

            <h2>Universal Entanglement Growth along Imaginary Time in Quantum Critical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-Yu Shen, Shuai Yin, Zi-Xiang Li</p>
            <p>Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.</p>

            <p>The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</p>

            <p>We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.</p>

            <p>Order versus disorder in the structure of materials plays a key role in the theoretical prediction of their properties. However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Ferromagnetic Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hao Wan, Peng-Yi Liu, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect holds fundamental importance in topological physics and technological promise for electronics. It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Terahertz switching of antiferromagnetic order by Néel spin-orbit torques</h2>

            <p>Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ by $\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.</p>

            <h2>Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthieu Mambrini, Nathan Goldman, Didier Poilblanc</p>
            <p>At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.</p>

            <h2>Universal and Experiment-calibrated Prediction of XANES through Crystal Graph Neural Network and Transfer Learning Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichang Lin, Wenjie Chen, Yitao Lin, Xinxin Zhang, Yuegang Zhang</p>
            <p>Theoretical simulation is helpful for accurate interpretation of experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra that contain rich atomic and electronic structure information of materials. However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction.</p>

            <h2>Reversible Excitonic Charge State Conversion and High Quasiparticle Densities in PVA-doped Monolayer WS$_2$ on 2D Microsphere Array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debasish Biswasray, Yogendra Singh, Amar Jyoti Biswal, Bala Murali Krishna Mariserla</p>
            <p>Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.</p>

            <p>Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 °C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.</p>

            <p>Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. V. Tokatly, Y. Lu, F. S. Bergeret</p>
            <p>We show that nonequilibrium spin injection into a superconductor can generate an anomalous supercurrent or induce a phase gradient, even for spin voltages below the superconducting gap. Our mechanism does not require breaking time-reversal symmetry in the effective superconducting Hamiltonian, but instead relies on nonequilibrium spin injection. We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages. Our results provide a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predict novel effects arising from spin-charge coupling, including the electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling. These effects are broadly testable in a variety of materials and hybrid superconducting structures.</p>

            <p>Phosphorus-based lubricant additives are used for protecting metallic contacts under boundary lubrication by forming surface films that reduce wear and friction. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) and their nanocomposites are driving the next generation of photonic applications. Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.</p>

            <p>We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.</p>

We report three primary quantitative discoveries: (i) The characteristic energy decay time exhibits a universal inverse scaling $\tau_0 \propto \epsilon^{-1.03 \pm 0.02}$ with the dissipation parameter $\epsilon = 1 - e^2$. (ii) The steady-state temperature follows a precise power-law $T_{\mathrm{steady}} \propto \epsilon^{-1.51 \pm 0.03}$, reflecting the non-linear balance between thermostat heating and collisional dissipation. (iii) The velocity autocorrelation function $\bar{A}(\tau_w, \tau)$ demonstrates pronounced aging, with decay rates $\lambda$ following a power-law slowing down $\lambda(\tau_w) \propto \tau_w^{-0.82 \pm 0.05}$.

            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient-pressure in strained thin films raises the question of how superconductivity can be optimized through strain. In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $\Gamma$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritesh Bhola, Kedar Damle</p>
            <p>Recent work that analyzed the effect of vacancy disorder on a short-range resonating valence bond spin liquid state of kagome-lattice antiferromagnets argued that such spin liquids are stable to vacancy disorder. The argument relied crucially on a numerical study that identified the following property of the site-diluted kagome lattice: maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of any connected component of such site-diluted kagome lattices have at most one unmatched vertex that hosts a monomer. Here, we provide an inductive proof of a stronger result that implies this property: If a connected cluster of such a lattice has an odd number of vertices, its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition~\cite{Lovas_Plummer_1986} has exactly one ${\mathcal R}$-type region that spans the entire connected cluster and hosts a single monomer of any maximum-density dimer packing. If on the other hand it has an even number of sites, it admits perfect matchings (fully-packed dimer coverings with no monomers) and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition consists of a single ${\mathcal P}$-type region that spans the entire cluster. Our proof also applies to the site-diluted Archimedean star lattice, the site-diluted pyrochlore lattice (corner-sharing tetrahedra), the site-diluted hyperkagome lattice, and, more generally, to any lattice satisfying a certain local connectivity property. It does not apply to bond-diluted versions of such lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Urna Basu, Satya N. Majumdar, Alberto Rosso</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of a run-and-tumble particle in a double-well potential and demonstrate that, in stark contrast to Brownian particles, active dynamics can lead to strong ergodicity breaking. When the barrier height exceeds a critical threshold, the long-time position distribution depends crucially on the initial condition: if the particle starts within the basin of attraction of one well, it remains trapped there, while if it begins between the two basins, it can reach either well with a finite probability, which we compute exactly via hitting probabilities. Below the critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution, which we derive analytically. Using this result, we also estimate the characteristic barrier crossing time and show that it violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law, and displays a divergence near the critical height following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like form with an anomalous exponent $1/2$.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for rare-region physics in the structural and electronic degrees of freedom of the nickelate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$</h2>

            <p>We present a diffuse neutron and x-ray scattering study of structural, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations in the electrical insulator La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$. This lamellar nickelate is an isostructural analogue of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, for which recent experiments uncovered evidence for unusual structural and superconducting fluctuations indicative of rare-region physics due to inherent inhomogeneity unrelated to common point disorder effects. We find closely analogous nanoscale orthorhombic fluctuation behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$, including exponential scaling of the diffuse scattering intensity and power-law scaling of the characteristic length with relative temperature. Moreover, our neutron and x-ray scattering data reveal similar behavior for short-range magnetic and charge fluctuations above the respective ordering temperatures. These observations indicate that rare-region effects are a generic feature of perovskite-related structures and lead to universal fluctuations of both structural and electronic degrees of freedom over extended temperature ranges.</p>

            <h2>Symbolic recursion method for strongly correlated fermions in two and three dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ermakov, Oleg Lychkovskiy</p>
            <p>We present a symbolic implementation of recursion method for the dynamics of strongly correlated fermions on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices. Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters.</p>

            <h2>Relation between winding numbers and energy dispersions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quancheng Liu, Klaus Ziegler</p>
            <p>Two-band Hamiltonians provide a typical description of topological band structures, in which the eigenfunctions can be characterized by a %Bloch vector field whose winding number that defines an integer topological invariant. This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures.</p>

            <h2>Octahedral rotation instability in Ba$_2$IrO$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alaska Subedi</p>
            <p>Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ has been refined in the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase without octahedral rotations, and its physical properties have been interpreted in this high-symmetry structure. However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Shu-Heng Shao, Ruben Verresen</p>
            <p>Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for scientific data extraction from publications, but rely on manual prompt refinement. We present an expert-grounded automatic prompt optimization framework that enhances LLM entity extraction reliability. Using high-entropy alloy lattice constant extraction as a testbed, we optimized prompts for Claude 3.5 Sonnet through feedback cycles on seven expert-annotated publications. Despite a modest optimization budget, recall improved from 0.27 to > 0.9, demonstrating that a small, expert-curated dataset can yield significant improvements. The approach was applied to extract lattice constants from 2,267 publications, yielding data for 1,861 compositions. The optimized prompt transferred effectively to newer models: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash. Analysis revealed three categories of LLM mistakes: contextual hallucination, semantic misinterpretation, and unit conversion errors, emphasizing the need for validation protocols. These results establish feedback-guided prompt optimization as a low-cost, transferable methodology for reliable scientific data extraction, providing a scalable pathway for complex LLM-assisted research tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Süzen</p>
            <p>The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.</p>

            <p>With the availability of ever-increasing computational capabilities, robust and automated research workflows are essential to enable and facilitate the execution and orchestration of large numbers of interdependent simulations in supercomputer facilities. However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD).</p>

            <h2>Discrete equations and auto-traveling kinks of the $ϕ^6$ model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. Susanto, N. Karjanto</p>
            <p>We study the $\phi^{6}$ model and derive two broad classes of lattice discretizations that admit static, translationally invariant kinks; that is, stationary kink profiles that can be centered at an arbitrary position relative to the lattice. These discretizations are constructed using a one-dimensional map, $\phi_{n+1}=F(\phi_{n})$, which provides a direct and systematic algorithm for generating such models. Numerical computations for two representative cases show that the discrete kinks do not possess internal modes, consistent with the continuum theory, although an additional high-frequency mode may appear above the phonon band. We also show that generic discretizations of the $\phi^{6}$ model do not support static kink solutions. Instead, the resulting dynamics produce auto-traveling and self-accelerating kinks that propagate at the maximal group velocity while continuously emitting radiation.</p>

            <h2>A novel large-strain kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced laminated composites and its application in the characterization of damage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandipan Paul Shivam</p>
            <p>In this paper, a novel kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced composite materials is presented. For this purpose, we use the multiple natural configurations in conjunction with the multi-continuum theory of Bedford and Stern~(1972). Keeping the underlying physics of the proposed kinematics consistent. The proposed kinematics results in a three-term decomposition of the deformation gradient i.e. $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}^e\mathbf{F}^r_\alpha\mathbf{F}^d_\alpha$, where $\alpha$ represents either the matrix or the fiber. After discussing the kinematic framework in detail, we use this new kinematic framework to characterize the damage contents associated with four damage mechanisms. These damage mechanisms are matrix cracking, fiber breakage, interfacial slip or debonding, and delamination. While the first two are derived by measuring the incompatibility of the pertinent configuration occupied by individual constituents, the latter two involve a relative displacement between either the constituents or the laminæ. The geometric interpretation corresponding to these damage mechanisms is also presented using tools from differential geometry. The derived damage contents can be used in developing an appropriate constitutive model for laminated composites undergoing damage.</p>

We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna-Maria Alexandrova, Jesus Valdiviezo</p>
            <p>A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</p>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.</p>

Using a combination of polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) spectroscopy, we identify clear phase- and morphology-dependent anisotropic nonlinear responses. Triangular \zbAgI $(111)$ flakes exhibit sixfold SHG symmetry and isotropic 2PPL emission, while rod-shaped \wzAgI $(101)$ samples display twofold-symmetric patterns in both SHG and 2PPL, which are explained by polarization analysis using second- and third- order nonlinear susceptibilities.

            <p>The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.</p>

            <p>In the outer core of neutron stars, $^3$P$_2$ superfluid neutrons and $^1$S$_0$ superconducting protons are deemed to exist, forming quantum vortices and magnetic fluxtubes, respectively. Those quantum vortices and fluxtubes play an important role in explaining observed sudden changes of rotational frequency, known as pulsar ``glitches.'' While the most of conventional glitch models rely on pinning/unpinning dynamics of neutron $^1\text{S}_0$ superfluid vortices in the inner crust, contributions of the outer core have not been ruled out. However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\text{S}_0$ protons. In this contribution, we outline our theoretical framework and report tentative results showing how shape of quantum vortices could be affected by the presence of a proton fluxtube.</p>

            <p>We develop a systematic Hamiltonian formulation of minimally doubled lattice fermions in (3+1) dimensions, derive their nodal structures (structures of zeros), and classify their symmetry patterns for both four-component Dirac and two-component Weyl constructions. Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires "moderate" parameter tuning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</p>

            <p>The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria. We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.</p>

            <h2>Elastomer-based whispering gallery mode microlasers with low Young's modulus for biosensing applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melisa A. Bayrak, David Ripp, Joseph S. Hill, Marcel Schubert</p>
            <p>Sensing biological forces with microscopic lasers is an emerging technique that offers significant advantages over conventional fluorescent probes and imaging-based techniques. However, the limited availability of suitable deformable or elastic microlaser materials is restricting the scale of forces that can be detected which strongly narrows their overall applicability. Here, we describe the synthesis of spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a commercially available elastomer material in a microfluidic system with high viscosity. Upon doping with organic dye molecules, the microbeads show excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds. Measurements of the mechanical properties reveal that the lasing characteristics are directly proportional to the applied external force. The measured Young's modulus confirms that the newly synthesized microlasers are very soft and can detect higher forces than previously applied deformable microlasers made from oil droplets. Furthermore, we show that elastomer microlasers are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments, making them ideally suited for sensing forces inside tissues and small animals.</p>

            <h2>Switching Transition in a Resource Exchange Model on Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreeman Auromahima, Sitangshu Bikas Santra, Biplab Bose</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate a simple nonequilibrium system with many interconnected, open subsystems, each exchanging a globally conserved resource with an external reserve. The system is represented by a random graph, where nodes represent the subsystems connected through edges. At each time step, a randomly selected node gains a token (i.e, a resource) from the reserve with probability (1-p) or loses a token to the reserve with probability p. When a node loses a token, its neighbors also lose a token each. This asymmetric token exchange breaks the detailed balance. We investigate the steady state behavior of our model for different types of random graphs: graphs without edges, regular graphs, Erdős-Rényi, and Barabási-Albert graphs. In all cases, the system exhibits a sharp, switch-like transition between a token-saturated state and an empty state. When the control parameter p is below a critical threshold, almost all tokens accumulate on the graph. Furthermore, in a non-regular graph, most tokens accumulate or condense on nodes of minimum degree. A slight increase in p beyond the threshold drains almost all the tokens from the graph. This switching transition results from the interplay between drift and the conservation of tokens. However, the position of the critical threshold and the behavior at the transition zone depend on graph topology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Cicalese, Giuliana Fusco, Giovanni Savaré</p>
            <p>We continue the variational study of the discrete-to-continuum evolution of lattice systems of Blume-Emery-Griffith type which model two immiscible phases in the presence of a surfactant. In our previous work \cite{CFS}, we analyzed the case of a completely wetted crystal and described how the interplay between surfactant evaporation and mass conservation leads to a transition between crystalline mean curvature flow and pinned evolutions. In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states. This provides, to our knowledge, the first discrete-to-continuum variational description of partially wetted crystalline interfaces, bridging the gap between microscopic lattice models and experimentally observed surfactant-induced pinning phenomena in immiscible systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Canossa, Lode Pollet, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado, Hao Song, Ke Liu</p>
            <p>Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.</p>

            <p>Mesoscopic models of the optical response of metals have emerged as fundamental building blocks in quantum plasmonics, in principle overcoming the computational bottlenecks of ab initio techniques by implementing aspects of the atomistic description of the metal in otherwise classical calculations. Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries.</p>

            <p>We study the average bipartite entanglement entropy of Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry, constrained to fixed total spin $J$ and magnetization $J_z = 0$. Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f < \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.</p>

In reality, molecules are spatially extended and embedded in anisotropic environments, where molecular orbitals (MOs) play a central role in determining quantum behavior. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model within the MO framework, with explicit inclusion of intramolecular vibrational motion. From this MO foundation, we derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM). As a demonstration, we analyze hydrogen molecules and hydrogen molecular ions with vibrational degrees of freedom, revealing their linear absorption spectra.</p>

Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the efficient modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators (FTRs) using flip-chip or on-chip-based input coils. The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $\beta_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$\Phi_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals.</p>

            <p>We study the replica-symmetric saddle point equations for the Ising perceptron with Gaussian disorder and margin $\kappa\ge 0$. We prove that for each $\kappa\ge 0$ there is a critical capacity $\alpha_c(\kappa)=\frac{2}{\pi\,\mathbb E[(\kappa-Z)_+^2]}$, where $Z$ is a standard normal and $(x)_+=\max\{x,0\}$, such that the saddle point equation has a unique solution for $\alpha\in(0,\alpha_c(\kappa))$ and has no solution when $\alpha\ge \alpha_c(\kappa)$. When $\alpha\uparrow \alpha_c(\kappa)$ and $\kappa>0$, the replica-symmetric free energy at this solution diverges to $-\infty$. In the zero-margin case $\kappa=0$, Ding and Sun obtained a conditional uniqueness result, with one step verified numerically. Our argument gives a fully analytic proof without computer assistance.

To this aim, we reformulate the partition function of the model in terms of a discrete log-gas, and study its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit. We reproduce previous results, obtained by using a differential equation approach. Moreover, we provide the explicit form of the resolvent in all possible regimes.

            <p>H2O is a unique substance with exceptional thermal properties arising from the subtle interplay between its electronic, phononic, and structural degrees of freedom. Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems.</p>

            <p>The energy-transfer efficiency of the natural photosynthesis system seems to be perfectly optimized during the evolution for millions of years. However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems.</p>

            <p>Multicomponent vesicles suspended in viscoelastic fluids are crucial for understanding a variety of physiological processes. In this work, we develop a continuum surface force (CSF) phase-field model to investigate the hydrodynamics of inextensible multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid flows with inertial forces. Our model couples a fluid field comprising both Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, a surface concentration field representing the multicomponent distribution on the vesicle membrane, and a phase-field variable governing the membrane evolution. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the full Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid field. The surface concentration field is determined by Cahn-Hilliard equations, while the membrane evolution is governed by a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. The membrane is coupled to the surrounding fluid through the continuum surface force (CSF) framework. To ensure stable numerical solutions of the highly nonlinear multi-field model, we employ a residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method for the Navier-Stokes equations, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the Oldroyd-B equations, and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The system of PDEs is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized-$\alpha$ time integration method. To enhance spatial accuracy, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present a series of two-dimensional numerical examples in shear and Poiseuille flows to elucidate the influence of membrane composition and fluid viscoelasticity on the hydrodynamics of multicomponent vesicles.</p>

We give three examples of such quantum dilogarithms, leading to integrable 3D lattice models.

            <p>Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) offer robust platforms for light manipulation, but reconfigurable control of their topological properties without degrading performance remains a major challenge. While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices.</p>

            <p>How can we learn the laws underlying the dynamics of stochastic systems when their trajectories are sampled sparsely in time? Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks.

Present article has gone through systematic microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed. The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a solid-based to a fluid-based picture.

            <p>The Mott transition, a metal-insulator transition due to strong electronic interaction, is observed in many materials without an accompanying change of system symmetry. An important open question in Mott's proposal is the role of long-range screening, whose drastic change across the quantum phase transition may self-consistently make the transition more abrupt, toward a first-order one. Here we investigate this effect in a model system of hydrogen atoms in a cubic lattice, using charge self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory that incorporates approximately the long-range interaction within the density functional treatment. We found that the system is well within the charge-transfer regime and that the charge-transfer gap intimately related to the Mott transition closes smoothly instead. This indicates that the long-range screening does not play an essential role in this prototypical example. This finding can be understood from the fact that the obtained insulating phase in this model system is driven by strong local interaction, and the transition is associated with the closing of charge-transfer gap. Contrary to Mott's length scale argument, such energetic competition between kinetic energy and local interaction is thus insensitive to long-range screening.</p>

Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</p>

            <p>Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C. H. Lai, M.-J. Hsieh, N. Puri, Yiing-Rei Chen, J. K. Wang, Y. H. Liang, P.-Y. Chen, Shin-ichiro Yano, C.-W. Wang, C. H. Du, C. L. Huang, J.-Y. Lin</p>
            <p>The copper metaborate CuB_2O_4(CBO) has been studied within the parametric space of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T), showing a series of distinct phases, including commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders, as well as magnetic soliton phases. However, no single study has simultaneously demonstrated all these phases. moreover, the existence of additional phases below 2 K or above 2 T for B perpenducular to c has been scarcely explored. This work presents the first comprehensive construction of the complex B-T phase diagram for T = 0.1 to 25 K and B = 0 to 9 T (B perpenducular to c), utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our findings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles calculations help to gain a deeper understanding of this complex phase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T regime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange and superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B) sublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground state at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to low temperatures is only 0.76 Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin 1/2. Using CBO as a model system, the present work elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying the formation of complex magnetic phases.</p>

            <p>We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Roček, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a global one-form ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Wetting by Concentrated Granular Suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reza Azizmalayeri, Peyman Rostami, Thomas Witzmann, Christopher O. Klein, Günter K. Auernhammer</p>
            <p>Many functional materials, such as paints and inks used in applications like coating and 3D printing, are concentrated granular suspensions. In such systems, the contact line dynamics and the internal structure of the suspension interact through shear rate dependent viscosity and microstructural rearrangements. The local shear rate increases sharply near moving contact lines, leading to the non-Newtonian rheology of dense suspensions in this region. While hydrodynamic solutions can describe dilute suspensions, their applicability near advancing contact lines in dense suspensions remains unclear. This study quantifies the deviation from the Newtonian solution by systematically varying interparticle interactions through the choice of dispersion medium. We use silica particles suspended in two refractive index-matched fluids: (i) aqueous 2,2'-thiodiethanol (weak interactions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (strong interactions). These systems exhibit substantially different rheological responses, shear-thickening and yield-stress behaviour, respectively. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), we resolve the three-dimensional trajectories of tracer particles within a drop driven over a substrate, in an arrangement enabling tracking the internal flows over a long travel distance of the drop. We observe distinct flow behaviours depending on the particle interactions and the resulting suspension rheology. The more the particle interactions play a role, i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian effects are, the stronger the measured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian solution to the hydrodynamic equations. In the shear-thickening suspension, a notable deviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, the yield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, with Newtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near the substrate.</p>

            <h2>Exciton pairs coupled via the long-living phonons and their superfluorescent markers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Al. Osipov, Boris Fainberg</p>
            <p>A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Generalized $η$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Lieta</p>
            <p>By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ji-Hui Pei, Christian Maes</p>
            <p>Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Molecular Interactions Near an Atomic Feshbach Resonance: Stability and Collapse of a Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Wang, Ke Wang, Zhendong Zhang, Qijin Chen, Cheng Chin, K. Levin</p>
            <p>Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules is a cornerstone of quantum chemistry. While the laboratory creation of degenerate molecular gases comprised of bosonic atoms has unlocked powerful new platforms for quantum simulation, progress is limited by the absence of a robust theoretical framework for characterizing inter-molecular interactions. This is in stark contrast to the situation for Fermi gases. In this Letter, we present such a framework providing universal expressions for these molecular scattering lengths as functions of experimentally measurable quantities. Our discoveries are crucial for understanding molecular condensate formation. Calculations of the compressibility reveal that a sign change in such molecular scattering lengths is directly correlated with the instability of these condensates. These results offer fresh insight with broad applications for atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics, as well as quantum chemistry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush De, Leo Radzihovsky, Snir Gazit</p>
            <p>We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Cocconi, Michalis Chatzittofi, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>The study of active solids offers a window into the mechanics and thermodynamics of dense living matter. A key aspect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such active systems is a mechanistic description of how the underlying mechano-chemical couplings arise, which cannot be resolved in models that are phenomenologically constructed. Here, we follow a bottom-up theoretical approach to develop a thermodynamically consistent active solid (TCAS) model, and uncover a non-trivial cross-talk that naturally ensues between mechanical response and dissipation. In particular, we show that dissipation reaches a maximum at finite stresses, while it is inhibited under large stresses, effectively reverting the system to a passive state. Our findings establish a generic mechanism plausibly responsible for the non-monotonic behaviour observed in recent experimental measurements of entropy production rate in an actomyosin material and enzymatic activity in crowded condensates.</p>

            <p>Following recent intensive studies on altermagnetism(ALM) characterized by non-relativistic even-parity spin splitting, realizing unconventional odd-parity magnetism has also attracted increasing interest. Here, using symmetry arguments based on spin-group analyses, we elucidate the sufficient conditions for the presence of odd-parity spin splitting in collinear antiferromagnetic systems, which is further established as the standard odd-parity ALM. Then, we utilize the well-known Haldane-Hubbard model to identify the odd-parity spin splitting in the collinear ALM ground state where the nonmagnetic TRS is broken by sublattice currents coming from the Haldane hopping. A comprehensive phase diagram involving the Haldane hopping strength and the onsite electron Coulomb repulsion is established to elucidate correlation-driven electronic phases.</p>

            <p>The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</p>

            <p>The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is widely used for modeling disordered materials under periodic boundary conditions, with the ATAT mcsqs module being one of the most established implementations. However, SQS generation with mcsqs typically relies on manual preparation of input files, ad hoc execution scripts, and post-processing steps, which introduces user-dependent errors and limits reproducibility. Here, we present SimplySQS (this https URL), an automated and reproducible workflow for SQS generation that is delivered through an online, interactive interface. SimplySQS guides users through structure import, compositional and supercell definition, and cluster parameter selection, while automatically generates all required ATAT input files and a single all-in-one execution script that encapsulates the complete search process. By standardizing input preparation, execution, and output analysis, the framework minimizes errors associated with manual file handling and enables consistent reproducibility of SQS searches. The workflow is demonstrated on the Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)) perovskite system. SQSs spanning the entire concentration range were generated using a single automated bash script produced by SimplySQS, after which all resulting structures were subjected to geometry optimization using a universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0). This approach reliably reproduced the experimentally observed cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic region (x > 0.5) and less than 4 % in the tetragonal region (x < 0.5). Overall, SimplySQS transforms SQS generation with ATAT into intuitive, reproducible, and systematic framework for modeling disordered materials.</p>

Exploiting the field-theoretic renormalization group approach within the minimal subtraction scheme, we compute the three-loop renormalization group functions. On their basis, with the help of asymptotic series resummation methods, we estimate the correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ characterising the new universality class for $d=3$ and for those values of $\sigma$ for which long-range interactions are relevant for the critical behaviour.</p>

            <p>The coalescence of liquid lenses is relevant in various applications, including inkjet printing and fog harvesting. However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\theta < 40^{\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition.</p>

            <p>Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Magnus F Ivarsen</p>
            <p>Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that the polar alignment interaction is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics. This constraint naturally generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. These results classify chiral active matter as a dissipative spintronic fluid, revealing that the transition to active turbulence is the emergence of a topological quasiparticle gas, where macroscopic Onsager dipoles acquire effective inertia from the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Ge, Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Majid Hosseinzadeh, Erfan Salahinejad</p>
            <p>This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the Broken Symmetry Phase of Solid Hydrogen: A Neural Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengdu Chai, Chen Lin, Xinyang Dong, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Wang, X.C. Xie</p>
            <p>The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</p>

            <h2>Spiral states, first-order transitions and specific heat multipeak phenomenon in $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model: A Wang-Landau algorithm study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Habib Ullah, Kun Li, Haoyu Lu, Youjin Deng, Wanzhou Zhang</p>
            <p>The classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is important for understanding frustrated magnetic phenomena in materials such as FePS$_3$ and Ba$_2$CoTeO$_6$, where diverse phases (e.g., striped, zigzag, armchair) and magnetization plateaus have been experimentally observed. To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and specific-heat multipeak phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</p>

            <h2>An exact dimension-reduced dynamic theory for developable surfaces and curve-fold origami</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhixuan Wen, Sheng Mao, Huiling Duan, Fan Feng</p>
            <p>Curve-fold origami, composed of developable panels joined along a curved crease, exhibits rich dynamic behaviors relevant to metamaterials and soft robotic systems. Despite multiple approximated models, a comprehensive and exact dynamical theory for curve-fold origami remains absent, limiting the precise predictions of its dynamics, especially for those with wide panels. In this work, we develop an exact dimension-reduced theory that focuses on the dynamics of curve-fold origami, utilizing the intrinsic one-dimensional nature of developable surfaces. Starting from a single developable surface, we investigate the kinematics and kinetic energy of a moving developable surface. By overcoming the difficulty of describing the motion of local frames, we derive the exact velocity field of wide surfaces solely described by the motion of the reference curve, which leads to the kinetic energy of the entire surface. Owing to the one-dimensional feature, the Lagrangian of the system, composed of both kinetic and elastic energy, is a functional of the reference curve. Thus, we may variate the Lagrangian and derive a nonlinear dynamical theory for the reference curve, which comprises governing equations similar to the rod model but can precisely describe the motion of developable surfaces. The theory is validated consistently in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks and is further extended to curved-fold origami modeled as a coupled bi-rod system. Utilizing our exact 1D model, we theoretically analyze the dynamical behaviors of various developable structures, revealing that the coupling of curvature and torsion along with the motion of local frames in our theory leads to the accurate modeling of arbitrarily deformed developable surfaces, which are validated by finite element analysis quantitatively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Tahmasbi, Andreas Knüpfer, Thomas D. Kühne, Hossein Mirhosseini</p>
            <p>The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahil N. Valani</p>
            <p>Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~Sáenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like oscillatory statistics can also arise from a purely local dynamical mechanism, revealed using a minimal Lorenz model description of a walking droplet viewed as an active particle with internal degrees of freedom. A localized defect directly perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This work opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs by revealing how quantum-like statistics can emerge from local internal-state dynamics of active particles.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at this https URL</p>

            <h2>Adhesion Energy of Phosphorene on Different Pristine and Oxidized Metallic Substrates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Vezzelli, Carsten Gachot, Maria Clelia Righi</p>
            <p>Black phosphorus and its single-layer constituent, phosphorene, have emerged as promising two-dimensional materials with remarkable tribological properties. However, recent experimental investigations revealed that the their lubricating capabilities can change with the substrate. The present computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these interfacial property with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene presents higher adhesion to all substrates with respect to pristine phosphorene, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the iron substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution correlates with the adhesion and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent lubricating properties of black phosphorus, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion.</p>

            <p>Terahertz (THz) technology shows great potential in 6G communications and imaging, but faces challenges related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation. Here, we integrate interferometric enhancement of absorption (IEA) from a metal reflection layer with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC)-based photodetector. The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 microseconds. We further demonstrate the potential of the device to distinguish concealed liquids, advancing high-responsivity, room-temperature, and compact terahertz imaging technology.</p>

            <p>In this article we present a new approach to the numerical valuation of derivative securities. The method is based on our previous work where we formulated the theory of pricing in terms of tradables. The basic idea is to fit a finite difference scheme to exact solutions of the pricing PDE. This can be done in a very elegant way, due to the fact that in our tradable based formulation there appear no drift terms in the PDE. We construct a mixed scheme based on this idea and apply it to price various types of arithmetic Asian options, as well as plain vanilla options (both european and american style) on stocks paying known cash dividends. We find prices which are accurate to $\sim 0.1%$ in about 10ms on a Pentium 233MHz computer and to $\sim 0.001%$ in a second. The scheme can also be used for market conform pricing, by fitting it to observed option prices.</p>

            <p>New evidence is presented in favor of irreversible decoherence as the mechanism which leads an initial out-of-equilibrium state to quasi-equilibrium in nematic liquid crystals. The NMR experiment combines the Jeener-Broekaert sequence with reversal of the dipolar evolution and decoding of multiple-quantum coherences to allow visualizing the evolution of the multi-spin coherence spectra during the formation of the quasi-equilibrium states. We vary the reversion strategies and the preparation of initial states and observe that the spectra amplitude attenuate with the reversion time, and notably, that the decay is frequency selective. We interpret this effect as evidence of "eigen-selection", a signature of the occurrence of irreversible adiabatic decoherence, which indicates that the spin system in liquid crystal NMR experiments conforms an actual open quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Emori, Hiroyasu Tajima</p>
            <p>Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</p>

We establish the formula for the exact conversion rate by completely specifying the relevant set of resource measures. The exact conversion is generally asymptotically irreversible due to the existence of multiple independent resource measures, and we find the necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic reversibility. On the other hand, we show that the approximate conversion rates diverge or vanish, which implies that the asymmetry can be infinitely amplified if we allow a vanishingly small error. We reveal the underlying mechanism of such a counterintuitive phenomenon by utilizing the properties of maximally asymmetric states.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulators based on trapped ions enable the study of spin systems and models with rich dynamical phenomena. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for fermions in one dimension is a canonical example that can support a topological insulator phase when couplings between sites are dimerized, featuring long-lived edge states. Here, we experimentally implement a spin-based variant of the SSH model using one-dimensional trapped-ion chains with tunable interaction range, realized in crystals containing up to 22 interacting spins. Using an array of individually focused laser beams, we apply site-specific, time-dependent Floquet fields to induce controlled bond dimerization. Under conditions that preserve inversion symmetry, we observe edge-state dynamics consistent with SSH-like behavior. We study the propagation and localization of spin excitations, as well as the evolution of highly excited configurations across different interaction regimes. These results demonstrate how precision Floquet engineering enables the exploration of complex spin models and dynamics, laying the groundwork for future preparation and characterization of topological and exotic phases of matter.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurelien Mordret, Adolfo G. Grushin</p>
            <p>Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</p>

Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters.</p>

            <p>Folklore belief holds that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erdős-Rényi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM.</p>

            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p>We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</p>

Classical holography of perfect (\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schrödinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself. Coupled phenomena, such as the Schrödinger--Newton system, are also discussed. The presented thermodynamic framework can shed light on some connections between formulations of classical and quantum physics.</p>

            <h2>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haimeng Zhao, Yuzhen Zhang, John Preskill</p>
            <p>The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</p>

            <h2>Mixed state deep thermalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xie-Hang Yu, Wen Wei Ho, Pavel Kos</p>
            <p>We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</p>

            <h2>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Pütz, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</p>

            <h2>Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holger Grosshans, Gizem Ozler, Simon Jantač</p>
            <p>Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.</p>

Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erdős-Rényi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erdős-Rényi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</p>

            <p>We construct a mathematical model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet, which is floating at a liquid surface and is driven by the surface tension gradient originating from the surface concentration field of the chemicals that are emitted from the droplet. We define the free energy of the system by including the surface and line energies. From the calculation of the functional of the free energy, we obtain a mathematical model for the diffusiophoretic motion with deformation. By only considering the deformation of the second mode, we explicitly derive the time-evolution equations for the translational motion and the elliptic deformation. There are three stable states: an immobile circular droplet, an immobile elliptically deformed droplet, and a moving droplet with the elliptic deformation in which the minor axis meets the motion direction, and we discuss the transition between these three stable states.</p>

We study the corresponding impacts in a perturbative expansion, formulating a scaling hypothesis for the order of shape corrections. We find that the pure nonlinearities dominate the mean and skewness. Crucially, we uncover that the leading correction to the variance is driven by noise propagation from the signal's effective curvature. We test the derived expansion with numerical simulations and illustrate its applicability on real neural spike data.</p>

In particular, we present the power spectral density of these processes and their increments. Our analytical findings are validated with numerical simulations. This work provides a comprehensive framework for modeling anomalous diffusion phenomena in multidimensional systems where component interdependencies are crucial.</p>

            <p>In order to find reliable and efficient numerical approximation schemes, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of one-particle irreducible two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. Based on this reformulation and reinterpretation we adopt a numerical scheme for the solution of field-dependent flow equations as nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more interesting problems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</p>

            <h2>Microscale selective laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles with a short-wavelength nanosecond laser</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youwen Liang, Bo Shen, Wan Shou</p>
            <p>Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</p>

            <p>The effective interaction between composite fermions, set entirely by the Coulomb potential and the underlying electronic Landau level orbitals, can stabilize exotic fractional quantum Hall states. In particular, half-filled Landau levels with different orbital character can host either metallic or paired phases of composite fermions. Here, we leverage experimental control over the orbital composition to realize a composite-fermion pairing transition in the first excited Landau level of bilayer graphene. Transport measurements at filling factors v = 9/2 and 11/2 reveal conductive states giving way to well-developed plateaus with increasing displacement fields. These states are insensitive to an in-plane magnetic field, indicating single-component ground states and thus pointing at non-Abelian orders. Our numerical study, based on displacement-field-dependent Landau-level wavefunctions, supports the orbital origin of the pairing transition and suggests Moore-Read or anti-Pfaffian ground states.</p>

            <h2>Criticality as a Universal Thermodynamic Requirement for Perfect Intrinsic Superconducting Diodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $\epsilon = I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+>I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $\epsilon=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $\epsilon\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $\epsilon$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $\epsilon$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.</p>

            <h2>Disorder driven maximum in the magnetoresistance of spin polaron systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanmoy Mondal, Pinaki Majumdar</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetic polarons are self trapped states of an electron in a locally spin polarised environment. They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $\rho(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\sim 20-30 \%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\sim 80\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation. This paper establishes the optimum disorder for maximising the magnetoresistance, suggests the physical process behind the unusual disorder dependence, and provides a magnetoresistance map - in terms of coupling and disorder - that locates some of the existing magnetic semiconductors within this framework.</p>

            <p>Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators can host quantum states with quantized magneto-electric responses, such as the axion and Chern insulators states evidenced in ultra-thin MnBi2Te4 films. Yet, whereas quantization is investigated thoroughly, transport properties related to the phase of charge carriers remains unexplored. Here, we study quantum coherent transport in mesoscopic Hall bars fabricated from thick exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes, and reveal the longest phase-coherence length ever observed in a mesoscopic magnet (about 500nm at 1K), associated to 2D topological surface states. In the fully-coherent regime, significant non-local contributions to quantum interference up to the micron scale lead to giant-amplitude universal conductance fluctuations (about 20e2/h). In the self-averaging regime, the statistical properties of conductance fluctuations confirm the 2D nature of quantum interference and different dephasing mechanisms are identified, as due to either magnetism or magnetic flux through coherent loops. Remarkably, the weak decoherence in magnetic topological insulator nanostructures show their potential to realize novel quantum spin interferometers based on dephasing by local magnetic textures at liquid-helium temperatures.</p>

            <p>The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $\delta$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$\delta$ phase diagram.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajun Lu, Mu Tian, Chaoxi Cui, Zhi-Ming Yu, Run-Wu Zhang, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>We propose a fractionally quantized polarization induced by interlayer sliding in bilayer altermagnets, unveiling a previously unrecognized multiferroic phase termed sliding fractional quantum multiferroicity (SFQM). This unconventional magnetic phase uniquely integrates sliding ferroelectricity with fractional quantum ferroelectricity, enabling highly efficient switching and nonvolatile electrical control of spin.~Unlike conventional multiferroics, SFQM simultaneously exhibits lattice-scale atomic displacements, ultralow switching barriers, and spin splitting, giving rise to a large fractionally quantized polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify bilayer altermagnet Ca(CoN)$_2$ and its family materials as promising candidates hosting SFQM. In contrast to gate-controlled schemes, the spin-layer coupling in SFQM is intrinsically induced by spontaneous electrical and layer polarization, requiring no sustained gate field and exhibiting nonvolatile character. This mechanism enables nonvolatile electrical control of spin through biaxial sliding, where displacements along the \textit{x}- and \textit{y}-axes generate opposite polarization directions in the layer-dependent electrical polarization. Furthermore, SFQM exhibits a fully switchable anomalous Hall effect and a pronounced magneto-optical response, which can be utilized for its detection and distinction. These findings highlight the promising role of sliding-mediated couplings among unconventional magnetism, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, and stacking order in realizing electrically controllable two-dimensional multiferroics.</p>

            <p>Graphene-based moire superlattices exhibit novel quantum phenomena driven by pronounced interactions, leading to topological corrected states like orbital Chern insulators exhibiting quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Typically, intrinsic Chern insulators are stabilized at odd moiré fillings, as even fillings often result in valley-balanced, topologically trivial states at zero magnetic field. In our work, we report the observation of an intrinsic Chern insulator with C = 1 state at moire filling v = 2 in rhombohedral octalayer graphene (R8G)/hBN moire superlattice. Observing such Chern insulators in particular with C = 1 at v = 2 is intriguing, as each moiré band carries Chern number C = 1 or -1. We further demonstrate such a state can originate from the entanglement between the low-energy moire flat bands and high-energy remote bands according to the Hartree-Fock calculation. Our findings extend the known topological phase diagram of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) moire systems and establish this platform as highly promising for investigating strong electron correlations and multiband hybridized transport.</p>

            <p>The realization of fractional Chern insulators opens up the possibility of exploring fractionally charged excitations and anyonic statistics in the absence of a magnetic field. One of the central questions is whether lattice-based systems can give rise to radically new states, distinct from those observed in traditional fractional quantum Hall systems. In this work, we investigate a new type of moire flat band system composed of Bernal bilayer graphene and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. First, we discover an unprecedented richness of states with high Chern numbers. At v = 1 moire filling, we observe Chern insulators with Chern numbers C = 4 and 3. Flanking v = 3 state, we observe a series of Chern insulators from C = 2 to C = 7. All of these states exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Remarkably, we observe an exotic fractional Chern insulator with C = 7/3 around v = 2/3 which is beyond all known fractional Chern insulators described by either the Jain sequence as or current high Chern theory. Our work expands the understanding of fractionally charged excitations beyond the Landau level basis and offers a new moiré platform for exploring anyons.</p>

In magnetic topological insulators, dissipationless edge states give functional devices in zero magnetic field, of interest for quantum metrology (resistance standard) or topological electronics (Chern networks). Here we show that a new generation of simple quantum circuits (disk, ring) with non-Hermitian topology, based on the interconnection of 1D Chern states in the quantum anomalous Hall regime, can have a much stronger quantization of their invariant than that of the Chern invariant itself, when measured in a non-metrology grade setup - that is, in industry-relevant conditions. Remarkably, the chirality-related topological skin effect is realized without the need of a magnetic field or an electrical gate, with a record degree of localization for a quantum Hall device. This new type of topological quantum devices based on magnets, with an exponential response that can be switched at small magnetic fields (about 200mT), can operate at liquid-Helium temperature with a good quantization and have some potential as cryogenic sensors for applications in high-precision impedance or magnetic field measurements.</p>

Here we study the velocities in a system with equal interaction strengths and equal masses of bosons and fermions. The resulting model is integrable and admits an exact Bethe-ansatz solution. We analyze it and analytically derive various exact results, which include the Drude weight matrix. We show that the excitation velocities can be calculated from the knowledge of the matrices of compressibility and the Drude weights, as their squares are the eigenvalues of the product of the two matrices. The elements of the Drude weight matrix obey certain sum rules as a consequence of Galilean invariance. Our results are consistent with the presence of a momentum-momentum coupling term between the two subsystems of bosons and fermions in the effective low-energy Hamiltonian. The analytical method developed in the present study can be extended to other models that possess a nested Bethe-ansatz structure.</p>

            <h2>Time-dependent fluctuating local field approach for description of the correlated fermions dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.D. Silakov, Ya.S. Lyakhova, A.N. Rubtsov</p>
            <p>We formulate a time-dependent Fluctuating Local Field (TD-FLF) method for correlated fermion dynamics, extending the stationary FLF approach. The wavefunction is approximated as an ensemble of non-interacting states subject to a classical fluctuating field, with dynamics encoded in the field's time-dependent distribution. This reduces the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to a generalized eigenvalue problem in a significantly reduced basis. Applied to half-filled 2D Hubbard lattices, TD-FLF yields highly accurate results, outperforming mean-field theory and capturing oscillation frequencies and amplitudes in good agreement with exact diagonalization. Its low computational cost and flexibility make TD-FLF a promising tool for simulating driven correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum tunneling and defect-induced transport modulation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayoub Bahlauoi, Youness Zahidi, Ahmed Naddami</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by interplay of anisotropic exchange interactions in honeycomb ferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Yu Ni, Xia-Ming Zheng, Peng-Tao Wei, Da-Yong Liu, Liang-Jian Zou</p>
            <p>A variety of distinct anisotropic exchange interactions commonly exist in one magnetic material due to complex crystal, magnetic and orbital symmetries. Here we investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnon in a honeycomb ferromagnet, and find a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by a complicated interplay of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), accompanied by the bulk gap close and reopen with chiral inversion. Moreover, this novel topological phase transition involves band inversion at high symmetry points $K$ and $K'$, which can be regarded as a pseudo-orbital reversal, i.e. magnon valley degree of freedom, implying a new manipulation corresponding to a sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. Indeed, it can be realized in 4$d$ or 5$d$ correlated materials with both spin-orbit coupling and orbital localized states, such as iridates and ruthenates, etc. This novel regulation may have potential applications on magnon devices and topological magnonics.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Magnetic and Topological Phases in EuMnXBi$_2$ (X=Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) Pnictides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deep Sagar, Abhishek Sharma, Arti Kashyap</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of the layered pnictides EuMnXBi2 (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn), focusing in particular on the relatively unexplored Bi-based member of the EuMn2X2 family. Unlike the well-studied As-, Sb-, and P--based analogues, we show that EuMn2Bi2 stabilizes in a C-type antiferromagnetic ground state with a narrow-gap semiconducting character. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) drives a transition from this trivial antiferromagnetic semiconductor to a Weyl semimetal hosting four symmetry-related Weyl points and robust Fermi arc states. Systematic substitution of Mn with Fe, Co, and Zn further reveals a tunable sequence of magnetic ground states: Fe and Co induce ferrimagnetism with semimetallic behavior, while Zn stabilizes a ferromagnetic semimetal with a large net moment. These findings establish Bi-based EuMnXBi2 pnictides as a versatile platform where magnetic exchange interactions and band topology can be engineered through SOC and chemical substitution. The complex interplay of magnetic interactions and topological effects in the proposed bulk and doped pnictides opens a promising avenue to explore a wide range of electronic and magnetic phenomena. In particular, this study demonstrates that EuMn2Bi2 hosts tunable magnetic and topological phases driven by electron correlations, chemical substitution, and spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico J. Gonzalez, Carmen A. Tachino, H. Fabio Busnengo</p>
            <p>In this work we investigate the dissociation of CO$_2$ on Cu(110) by performing density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional, with a potential energy surface parameterized using artificial neural networks. We computed quasi-classical trajectory calculations of molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities as a function of the initial impact energy of the molecules and surface temperature, by comparing our results with available supersonic molecular beam experimental data for normal incidence. Concerning the general dependence of the molecular and dissociative adsorption probabilities on the initial translational energy of the molecules, our theoretical results agree with experiments. Also in agreement with experiments, we have found that dissociative adsorption is not affected by surface temperature between 50 and 400 K, for impact energies for which the dissociation probability is larger than $\sim 10^{-3}$. We have investigated the influence of impact energy and surface temperature on the final state of the dissociation products by extending the time integration of the reactive trajectories up to 10 ps. We have found that above $\sim 2.5$ eV and close to or above room temperature, CO$_2$ dissociation induces strong surface distortions including final structures involving Cu adatoms. The creation of Cu vacancy-adatom pairs is stimulated by the presence of both CO$_{ads}$ and O$_{ads}$ which interact strongly with the Cu adatoms and even give rise to unexpected (O-Cu-CO)$_{ads}$ linear moieties anchored to the surface by the dissociated O atom and involving a Cu adatom almost detached from the surface. These surface distortions produced by dissociation products of high energy CO$_2$ molecules at and above room temperature might explain recent experiments that have found a greater saturation oxygen coverage for high energy molecules.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the relative importance of electronic and phononic energy dissipation during the molecular adsorption of CO on Cu(110). Initial sticking probabilities as a function of impact energy for CO impinging at normal incidence at a surface temperature of 90 K were computed using classical trajectory simulations. To this aim, we use a full-dimensional potential energy surface constructed using an atomistic neural network trained on density functional theory data obtained with the nonlocal vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functional. Two models are compared: one allowing only energy transfer and dissipation from the molecule to lattice vibrations, and the other also incorporating the effect of molecular energy loss due to the excitation of electron-hole pairs, modeled within the local-density friction approximation. Our results reveal, firstly, that the molecule mainly transfers energy to lattice vibrations, and this channel determines the adsorption probabilities, with electronic friction playing a minor role. Secondly, once the molecule is trapped near the surface (where electronic density is higher), electron-hole pair excitations accelerate energy dissipation, significantly promoting CO thermalization. Still, the faster energy dissipation when electron-hole pair excitations are accounted for accelerates the accommodation of the adsorbed molecules in the chemisorption well but does not significantly alter their lateral displacements over the surface.</p>

            <h2>Necessary conditions for spin-resolved Josephson diode effect across strongly spin-polarized magnetic materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danilo Nikolić, Niklas L. Schulz, Matthias Eschrig</p>
            <p>We present a set of necessary conditions for the appearance of charge and spin Josephson diode effects across strongly spin-polarized inhomogeneous magnetic materials (FM) placed between two spin-singlet superconductors. Noncoplanarity of the FM's spin texture gives rise to quantum geometric phases, $\Delta\varphi'$, that enter the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) similarly to the superconducting phase difference, resulting in charge and spin Josephson diode effects. Our study shows that such effects appear if the CPR possesses no phase-inversion center, achieved under the following conditions. First, noncoplanarity of the spin texture is necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry. Second, both spin bands have to contribute to the transport, i.e., the effect is absent in half-metallic junctions. Third, different band-specific densities of states are required, and this condition is ensured by the strong spin polarization of the FM. Finally, higher harmonics in the CPR are necessary, i.e., the effect is absent in the tunneling limit. However, even in this case, the CPR must not have a phase-inversion center, which is ensured by the restriction of the quantum geometric phase to values $\Delta\varphi'\neq k\pi/2, k\in\mathbb{Z}$. We formulate a minimal phenomenological model that incorporates all these points, qualitatively illustrating our theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Watanabe, Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda</p>
            <p>In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.</p>

            <p>X-ray circular dichroism (XCD), defined as the difference in absorption or scattering intensity between X-rays of opposite polarizations, arises from the breaking of spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry and is thus sensitive to chirality, magnetism, and their interplay. Non-reciprocal XCD, in which the dichroic response changes upon reversing the propagation direction of the probe, is generally forbidden in systems with both symmetries. Using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO$_3$, which we term ferro-rotational phonons. Their excitations provide a direct demonstration of non-reciprocal XCD in a system that globally preserves inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose that a condensate of these phonons, manifested as standing waves, underlies the ferro-rotational order in MnTiO$_3$. The interplay among photon helicity, phonon polarization, and the axial ferro-rotational order gives rise to the observed non-reciprocal circular dichroism.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.</p>

            <p>Terahertz (THz) technology shows great potential in 6G communications and imaging, but faces challenges related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation. Here, we integrate interferometric enhancement of absorption (IEA) from a metal reflection layer with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC)-based photodetector. The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 {\mu}s. We further demonstrate the potential of the device to distinguish concealed liquids, advancing high-responsivity, room-temperature, and compact terahertz imaging technology.</p>

            <p>Copper selenide is an exceptional quasi-layered monolithic material that exhibits both semiconducting and metallic properties in adjacent visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges. Here we introduce a thiol-free colloidal synthesis for generating quasi-2D klockmannite copper selenide nanocrystals via hot injection method, achieving shape control by tuning the injection temperature and precursor concentrations without any additional ligands. This approach produces large klockmannite nanosheets with lateral sizes from 200 nm to several micrometres, as well as uniform triangular nanoplatelets with sizes of 12-25 nm that are monocrystalline and display strong NIR plasmonic absorption. The spectral features of the anisotropic klockmannite phase in the NIR have been analysed using complex-scaled discrete dipole approximation (CSDDA) calculations, which reveal pronounced optical anisotropy and the emergence of hyperbolic regime. The combined effect of propagating and evanescent fields is regarded as the underlying reason of such modes in the hyperbolic domain. Finally, the ultrafast photophysical behaviour of the material in klockmannite phase is examined, including hot-hole cooling, trapping, and coherent phonons generation. Our findings emphasize the important role of the intrinsic crystal anisotropy in governing the physical properties of nanoscale klockmannite.</p>

            <p>The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.</p>

            <p>The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.</p>

We introduce a minimal model that captures the resulting non-linear pressure-flow relationship and propose a methodology capable of reproducing the time-dependent behaviour of the espresso brewing process. Finally, we show that dissolution dynamics play a central role in determining the temporal evolution of flow during extraction.</p>

            <p>Standard spectroscopic protocols model the dynamics of open quantum systems as a superposition of isolated, exponentially decaying eigenmodes. This paradigm fails fundamentally at Exceptional Points, where the eigenbasis collapses and the response becomes dominated by non-diagonalizable Jordan blocks. We resolve this ambiguity by introducing a geometric framework based on \textit{Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules} (DMHM). By replacing the scalar linewidth with a topological \textit{Weight Filtration}, we derive ``Weight Filtered Spectroscopy'' (WFS)--a protocol that spatially separates decay channels based on the nilpotency rank of the Liouvillian. We demonstrate that WFS acts as a dissipative x-ray, quantifying dissipative leakage in molecular polaritons and certifying topological isolation in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm rings. This establishes that topological protection persists as an algebraic invariant even when the spectral gap is closed.</p>

            <p>We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the existence of a pair of almost dissipationless oscillating modes at low temperatures in both the shear and sound channels of a hybrid quantum system, comprised of a weakly self-interacting perturbative sector coupled to strongly self-interacting holographic degrees of freedom described by a black hole geometry. We argue that these modes realize prethermal time-crystal behavior in semiholographic systems without fine-tuning and can be observed by measuring operators that probe either the hard (perturbative) or the soft (holographic) sector. We also find novel Gregory Laflamme type instabilities that lead to the formation of inhomogeneities at higher temperatures. These results provide evidence that black holes with planar horizons and dynamical boundary conditions can develop both inhomogeneous and metastable time crystal phases over a wide range of temperatures set by an intermediate scale. Furthermore, they suggest that such phases can be realized without external driving in nonAbelian plasmas of asymptotically free gauge theories in the large-$N$ limit.</p>

By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</p>

We present a direct and elementary spectral-theoretic proof treating the $d=1$ and $d=2$ cases on an almost equal footing. Moreover, we re-interpret the localizer as a higher-dimensional topological insulator via the bulk-edge correspondence.</p>

            <h2>Nascent biofilms on soft surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Garima Rani, G. H. Philipp Nguyen, René Wittmann, Hartmut Löwen, Anupam Sengupta</p>
            <p>Soft surfaces, spanning vastly different environmental and biomedical settings, are frequently colonised by surface-associated bacteria. Yet, how soft surfaces govern bacterial dynamics and their self-organisation into colonies remains poorly understood. Using experiments and agent-based modelling, we report the self-organisation of bacterial cells into nascent biofilms on soft substrates. By tuning the elastic modulus over two orders of magnitude, we show that the colony morphology, spreading dynamics and collective behaviour depend on the substrate stiffness, wherein softer surfaces promote slowly expanding, geometrically anisotropic, multilayered colonies, while harder substrates drive rapid, isotropic expansion of bacterial monolayers before multilayer structures emerge. Supported a cell mechanical model and two-dimensional agent-based simulations, our results identify that anisotropic drag forces on soft substrates, emerging due to local deformations, underpin colony anisotropy and swift verticalisation. In contrast, reduced drag on hard surfaces allows rapid expansion of monolayers, thus delaying the transition to a multilayer structure. Surface compliance, a key but overlooked determinant of early-stage biofilm development, could be harnessed to engineer biofilm structures and dynamics for nature-inspired and biomedical applications.</p>

            <h2>Tuning diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions by hydrostatic pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena F. Silkina, Evgeny S. Asmolov, Olga I. Vinogradova</p>
            <p>When two reservoirs of a distinct salinity are connected by channels or pores, a fluid flow termed diffusio-osmotic is generated. This article investigates the flow emerging in an uniformly charged long slit whose thickness exceeds the local Debye screening length. Attention is focussed on the role of hydrostatic pressure drop $\Delta p$ between reservoirs. For a thick slit we recover the known formula for a local diffusioosmotic slip over a single wall, which is determined by the surface potential, salt concentration and its gradient. An equation for the global fluid flow rate $\mathcal{Q}$ is presented as a sum of the diffusio-osmotic and pressure-driven contributions. Although the diffusio-osmotic term itself remains unaffected by $\Delta p$, the concentration and surface potential profiles along the slit, and consequently, the local slip velocity are dramatically modified. We present an equation relating the local concentration to $\mathcal{Q}$ and employ it to derive an expression describing the surface potential variation in the slit. Since $\mathcal{Q}$ can easily be tuned by $\Delta p$, the variety of possible concentration and surface potential profiles becomes very rich. Our theory provides a simple explanation of recent flow rate measurements and shows that experimental data provide rather direct information about concentration and surface potential profiles in the uniformly charged slit. The relevance of our results for sensing the salt dependence of surface potentials is discussed briefly.</p>

            <h2>Spacetime Spins: Statistical mechanics for error correction with stabilizer circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cory T. Aitchison, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>General Construction of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes from Multiple Classical Codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Wu, Meng-Yuan Li, Chengshu Li, Hui Zhai</p>
            <p>The hypergraph product (HGP) construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offers a general and explicit method for building a QECC from two classical codes, thereby paving the way for the discovery of good quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension. Our general construction protocol provides another perspective for enriching the structure of QECCs and enables the exploration of richer possibilities for good codes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vlad Temkin, Zack Weinstein, Ruihua Fan, Daniel Podolsky, Ehud Altman</p>
            <p>We investigate the statistical physics of quantum error correction in ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry-enriched topological quantum memories. Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders. At low nonzero temperatures and strong disorder, we find numerical evidence of a disorder-dominated loop-glass phase which corresponds to a "confidently incorrect" decoder. The zero-temperature limit defines the minimum-cost flow decoder, which serves as the ${\rm U}(1)$ analog of minimum-weight perfect matching in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological codes. Both the optimal and minimum-cost flow decoders are shown to dramatically outperform the charge-agnostic optimal decoder in symmetry-enriched topological codes.</p>

            <h2>Information Critical Phases under Decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Vijay, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges. We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.</p>

            <p>Relying on the quantum tunnelling concept and Maxwell-Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, Gamow shows that the star-burning process happens at temperatures comparable to a critical value, called the Gamow temperature ({\tt T}) and less than the prediction of the classical framework. In order to highlight the role of the equipartition theorem in the Gamow argument, a thermal length scale is defined, and then the effects of non-extensivity on the Gamow temperature have been investigated by focusing on the Tsallis and Kaniadakis statistics. The results attest that while the Gamow temperature decreases in the framework of Kaniadakis statistics, it can be bigger or smaller than {\tt T} when Tsallis statistics are employed.</p>

            <p>Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve coupled phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of coupled phonon-ion hopping modes which enhance Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes greatly increases the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of vibrational modes associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving TiO6 rocking modes via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the differential impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons. Additionally, we differentiate the ultrafast responses of LLTO due to ultrafast heating and THz-range vibrations using laser-driven spectroscopy (LUIS), finding a unique long-lived response for the THz-range excitation. These findings provide new insights into coupled ion migration mechanisms, indicating the important role of THz-range coupled phonon-ion hopping modes in enabling fast ion conduction at room temperature.</p>

In this work, we study the upper critical fields mu0Hc2 of 4Hb-TaS2 and 4Hb-TaS1.99Se0.01 single crystals systematically. Transport measurements up to 35 T show that both of ab-plane and c-axis upper critical fields (mu0Hc2,ab and mu0Hc2,c) for 4Hb-TaS2 and 4Hb-TaS1.99Se0.01 exhibit a linear temperature dependent behavior down to 0.3 K, suggesting the three-dimensional superconductivity with dominant orbital depairing mechanism in bulk 4Hb-Ta(S, Se)2. However, the zero-temperature mu0Hc2,ab(0) for both crystals are far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit mu0HP. It could be explained by the effects of spin-momentum locking in 1H-Ta(S, Se)2 layers with local inversion symmetry broken and the relatively weak intersublattice interaction between 1H layers due to the existence of 1T layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian-Peng Zhang, Chuanchang Zeng, Zhen-Biao Yang, Jose Carlos Egues, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>Nondemolition protocols use ancilla qubits to identify the fragile quantum state of a qubit without destroying its encoded information, thus playing a crucial role in nondestructive quantum measurements particularly relevant for quantum error correction. However, the multitude of ancilla preparations, information transfers, and ancilla measurements in these protocols create an intrinsic overhead for information processing. Here we consider an Andreev qubit defined in a quantum-dot Josephson junction and show that the macroscopic time-dependent oscillatory supercurrent arising from the quantum interference of the many-body eigenstates, can be used to probe the qubit itself-arbitrarily close to the nondestructive limit-under currently available experimental capabilities. This readout of arbitrary superposition states of Andreev qubits avoids ancillae altogether and significantly reduces experimental overhead as no repetitive qubit reinitialization is needed. Our prediction of an AC-like Josephson effect without an applied external voltage, which enables the nondestructive qubit readout, is a unique macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic dynamics of the Andreev quantum state. Our findings should have an unprecedented impact on advancing research and applications involving Andreev dots, thus positioning them as promising qubit contenders for quantum processing and technologies.</p>

            <h2>Hidden self-duality and exact mobility edges in quasiperiodic network models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai-Tao Hu, Xiaoshui Lin, Ai-Min Guo, Guangcan Guo, Zijin Lin, Ming Gong</p>
            <p>In one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, only a few models with exact mobility edges (MEs) have been constructed using generalized self-duality theory, Avila's global theory, or the renormalization group method. This raises an intriguing question that whether we can realize more physical models with exact solvable MEs. In this work, we uncover the hidden self-duality within a class of quasiperiodic network models constituted by periodic and quasiperiodic sites. Although the original Hamiltonians appear to lack self-duality, their effective Hamiltonians obtained by integrating out the periodic sites exhibit self-duality, which yield MEs. The well-studied mosaic model, which is the simplest case of quasiperiodic network models, was previously thought to exhibit MEs due to the absence of self-duality, but we show that they actually arise from the hidden self-duality. Using the effective Hamiltonian, we further introduce the concept of resonant states to understand the shape of MEs. Finally, we present in detail how to determine the MEs in various network models, including some non-Hermitian models, based on the hidden self-duality. These predictions can be experimentally realized using optical and acoustic waveguide arrays. Our work can greatly advance our understanding of MEs in Anderson transition.</p>

            <p>Quasiperiodic models are important physical platforms to explore Anderson transitions in low dimensional systems, yet the exact mobility edges (MEs) are generally hard to be determined analytically. To date, the MEs in only a few models can be determined exactly. In this manuscript, we propose a new class of network models characterized by quasiperiodic slowly varying potentials and the absence of hidden self-duality, and exactly determine their MEs. We take the mosaic models with slowly varying potentials as examples to illustrate this result and derive its MEs from the effective Hamiltonian. In this method, we can integrate out the periodic sites to obtain an effective Hamiltonian with energy-dependent potentials $g(E)V$ and effective eigenenergy $f(E)$, which directly yields the MEs at $f(E) = \pm(2t^\kappa \pm g(E)V)$, where $\kappa \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. With this idea in hand, we then generalize our method to more quasiperiodic network models, including those with much more complicated geometries and non-Hermitian features. Finally, we propose the realization of these models using optical waveguides and show that the Anderson transition can be observed even in small physical systems (with lattice sites about $L = 50 - 100$). Our results provide some key insights into the understanding and realization of exact MEs in experiments.</p>

For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging $p$-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.</p>

It introduces the foundational ideas and consolidates practical calibration (PSD-based trap stiffness and position sensitivity), protocol design (forward/reverse finite-time drives over multiple amplitudes and durations), and robust estimators for free-energy difference and dissipated work, highlighting finite-sampling and rare-event effects. We demonstrate the procedures using an extensive set of measured trajectories under different conditions and provide openly accessible datasets and Python code, enabling new researchers or educators to reproduce the results with minimal effort. Beyond pedagogical validation, we discuss how these recipes translate to broader soft-matter and mesoscopic contexts.

            <p>Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals, and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood. In this work, we attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of silicon crystallization during LIFT printing. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to investigate the size effect on the melting and crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found with the decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes rare, even with a low cooling rate. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 Å). The atomic structure evolution during solidification is also monitored to provide guidance for LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on single-crystal additive manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Localization of wave functions in disordered systems can be characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, which is zero in the extended phase and nonzero in the localized phase. Previous studies have shown that this exponent is an analytic function of eigenenergy in a given phase, thus its non-analytic behavior has been commonly used to determine the boundaries between the extended and localized phases. In this work, we show that if the localization centers are inhomogeneous across the whole chain and the system possesses (at least) two different localization modes, the Lyapunov exponent can become non-analytic in the localized phase at the boundaries between the different localization modes. We establish this central result by using several one-dimensional slowly varying models, and reveal that the non-analytic feature in the Lyapunov exponent is inherently tied to the singularities in the density of states through the Thouless formula. The possible existence of delicate structures in the localized phase effectively broadens our understanding of Anderson localization.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) materials, with their unique combination of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, are emerging as promising platforms for exploring excitonic phenomena. Thus far, the choice of materials with exceptional excitonic response has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) configurations of vdW materials. At the same time, large interlayer distance and the possibility to create a variety of heterostructures offers an opportunity to control the dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and van der Waals 3D materials, thus engineering the excitonic properties. Here, we reveal that bulk vdW crystal CrCl3 answers this quest with a record exciton binding energy of 1.64 eV owing to a delicate interplay of quasi-2D electronic confinement and local magnetic correlations. We also suggest that the non-local magnetic correlations play an important role in the temperature dependence of photoluminescence intensity. Furthermore, we observe colossal binding energies in vdW crystals NbOCl2 (0.66 eV) and MoCl3 (0.35 eV) and formulate a universal exciton binding energy dependence on bandgap for 2D and 3D vdW materials. Hence, our findings establish a fundamental link between the layered structure of vdW materials and their excitonic properties.</p>

            <p>Predicting the stable phase configuration in a liquid-gas system becomes a fundamental challenge when the stratification favored by gravity conflicts with arrangements induced by heat flow, particularly because standard equilibrium thermodynamics is insufficient in such non-equilibrium steady states. We propose a variational principle based on an extended thermodynamics, called global thermodynamics, to address this state selection problem. Our key finding is that gravity and heat flow effects are unified into a single parameter, ``effective gravity'' ($g_\mathrm{eff}$), within this framework. Crucially, the sign of $g_\mathrm{eff}$ determines the stable configuration: liquid is at the bottom if $g_\mathrm{eff} > 0$, and floats above the gas if $g_\mathrm{eff} < 0$. This provides a quantitative tool for the configuration prediction under competing drives.</p>

By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos.

In the case of the hydrogenated surface, the system spin is quenched, yielding a negatively charged azafullerene (C$_{59}$N$^-$) and neutrally charged NV$^0$ as the most stable electronic configuration. In contrast, fluorinating the surface favours the negatively charged NV$^-$, and conserves the C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$, neutrality and stabilizes uncompensated free spins. This opposing behaviour is attributed to surface charge doping emerging from different band bending effects associated with the surface EA. This study is consistent with experimentally observed photoluminescence quenching, and shows that surface passivation by fluorination could efficiently tackle the problem of charge transfer between adsorbed molecules and shallow NV centers.</p>

            <h2>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Hao Fu, Qianqian Lv, Yong Xu, Jorge Cayao, Jun-Feng Liu, Xiang-Long Yu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics beyond the limits of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and spin orbit coupled systems. We investigate spin selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two dimensional d-wave altermagnet, and identify a universal mechanism for achieving perfect spin polarization. The mechanism is dictated by Fermi surface geometry: closed Fermi surfaces in weak altermagnets yield partial and oscillatory spin filtering, whereas open Fermi surfaces in strong altermagnets intrinsically enforce fully spin polarized conductance. Exploiting these distinct transport regimes, we propose all electrical spin filter and spin valve architectures, where resonant tunneling produces highly spin polarized conductance tunable by gate voltage and interface transparency. Altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces further support gate reversible perfect spin polarization that remains robust against interface scattering, disorder, and temperature. We also demonstrate an electrically controlled spin valve that reproduces the functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions without magnetic fields or relativistic mechanisms. d-wave altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces thus provide a promising platform for low dissipation, scalable, and magnetic field free spintronic devices with potential for integration into next generation quantum and CMOS compatible technologies.</p>

            <h2>Magnon-plasmon coupling mediated by linear magnetoelectric effect in two-dimensional crystals with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wojciech Rudziński, Mirali Jafari, Józef Barnaś, Anna Dyrdał</p>
            <p>Recently, one can observe a renewed interest in coupling of spin waves (magnons) and collective charge oscillations (plasmons), especially in two-dimensional systems. Several mechanisms of the magnon-plasmon hybridization in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems have been proposed. Here, we consider another mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization, which is based on the linear magnetoelectric interaction. As a specific system we consider a monolayer of vanadium-based diselenide with perpendicular easy-axis magnetic anisotropy and Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction. The derived parameter of magnon-plasmon coupling is proportional to the magnetoelectric constant. Assuming for this constant an adequate experimental value, we calculate dispersion relations of the hybridized magnon-plasmon mods. Moreover, we also show that an external electric field normal to the layer (due to a gate voltage) can be used as a tool to tune the magnon modes and this way also hybridized magnon-plasmon coupling. A specific case of magnon-plasmon coupling based on tuning Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction is also considered.</p>

            <h2>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuyuki Okuma, Tomonari Mizoguchi</p>
            <p>The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</p>

            <h2>Quantum metric-based optical selection rules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongpan Li, Cheng-Cheng Liu</p>
            <p>The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>On the relationship between noise squeezing and Rabi oscillations in active quantum dot ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ori Gabai, Amnon Willinger, Igor Khanonkin, Vitalii Sichkovskyi, Johann Peter Reithmaier, Gadi Eisenstein</p>
            <p>Squeezed light is usually generated using passive nonlinear materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer nonlinearities but they differ in that they add amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Squeezing to below the vacuum level has been demonstrated in a semiconductor laser, and gain saturation in SOAs can likewise reduce photon-number fluctuations to, and in some cases below, the vacuum limit. Here, we demonstrate that Rabi oscillations in room-temperature quantum-dot SOAs, induced by short resonant pulses, cause cyclical noise modification that repeat with every change of 2pi in pulse area, corresponding to a fourfold increase in excitation pulse energy. Homodyne measurements reveal in those cases elliptical Wigner functions corresponding to squeezed thermal states and in certain regimes, the state is squeezed to below the vacuum level. At other pulse areas, the Wigner functions are circular representing thermal coherent states. This periodic behavior persists over two orders of magnitude in input pulse energy, spanning several 2pi cycles. Under specific bias and excitation conditions, we further observe a non-Gaussian Wigner function featuring two bright lobes. Although its precise nature remains unresolved, this structure may be consistent with a Schrodinger cat - like state whose accompanying negativity is suppressed due to an approximately 10 dB optical output loss. Notably, the emergence of this non-Gaussian state is itself periodic in excitation pulse energy.</p>

            <p>Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyu Tang, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. P. Mikitik, Yu. V. Sharlai</p>
            <p>We propose a four-band model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Allen Myers, Nigel Lee En Hew, Shun-Li Shang, Zi-Kui Liu</p>
            <p>The recursive property of entropy is well known in the field of information theory; however, the concept is rarely used in the field of thermodynamics, despite being the field where the concept of entropy originated. This work shows that the equation for entropy used in the zentropy approach, which is an exact multiscale approach to thermodynamics, is a statement of the recursive property of entropy. Further, we clarify the meaning of entropy as the uncertainty arising from unconstrained degrees of freedom and separate configurational and intra-configurational contributions. Building on this, we derive the Helmholtz energy and the partition function, as used in zentropy. The resulting framework is exact for a chosen level of description and enables principled coarse-graining, thereby reducing computational complexity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. These results position zentropy as a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, facilitating quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena.</p>

            <p>The fabrication of large, high-quality single crystals (SCs) of all-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) via accessible methods remains a significant challenge. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method, where the experimental design is guided by a theoretical methods at each step. A synergistic 9:1 (v/v) DMSO/DMF binary solvent was selected to balance solubility and kinetics, a choice rationalized by an analysis of Gutmann's donor numbers. Subsequently, ethanol was selected as a promising antisolvent by evaluating its properties against key criteria of miscibility and diffusion rate using Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Fick's law expressed in terms of saturated vapor pressure. Within this rationally-defined chemical system, the "growth window" was experimentally mapped, identifying an optimal precursor concentration of 0.35 M and a preliminary titration step to induce a controlled metastable state. The optimized protocol consistently yields phase-pure, orthorhombic CsPbBr$_3$ SCs up to 1 cm in size within one week at room temperature. The resulting crystals exhibit high crystallinity and thermal stability up to \SI{550}{\celsius}</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung Ba Tran, Toyoto Sato, Ryuhei Sato, Hiroyuki Saitoh, Shin-ichi Orimo, Hao Li</p>
            <p>Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet effective and reversible storage remains challenging. AB3-type intermetallic alloys are promising for solid-state hydrogen storage due to intermediate thermodynamic stability and rapid hydrogen uptake. Optimizing stability and gravimetric density is hindered by competing thermodynamic and magnetic effects. Here, we analyze AB3 compounds (A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni) and ternary alloys CaxYyMg1-x-yB3 using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a direct correlation between formation energy and total magnetic moment that dictates alloy stability, explaining the trade-off in hydrogen storage. In Co-rich systems with large lattice volumes, formation energy rises with magnetization, showing magnetism as the dominant factor. Mg-rich compositions achieve high gravimetric densities, but strong magnetism destabilizes the system, requiring Y substitution to suppress magnetic moments. Replacing Co with Ni weakens magnetism: YNi3 is nonmagnetic, while CaNi3 and MgNi3 are weakly polarized, allowing thermodynamic stability across compositions. Notably, CaMg2Ni9 combines high theoretical capacity (3.32 wt%) with good reversibility. Mg-rich Ni-based alloys are predicted to offer negative formation energies with the highest gravimetric densities (up to 3.40 wt%). These results show that controlling magnetism via transition-metal substitution is key to overcoming the stability-capacity trade-off in AB3 hydrogen storage materials.</p>

This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters. Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 570 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</p>

The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>First-principles density functional simulations were employed to investigate the geometries, electrical properties, and hyperfine structures of various beryllium-doped diamond configurations, including interstitial (Be$_i$), substitutional (Be$_s$), and beryllium-nitrogen (Be-N) complexes. The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion. Be$_s$-N$_3$ and Be$_s$-N$_4$ co-doping introduces shallow donors, while Be$_s$ exhibits $n$-type semiconductivity, but the deep donor level renders it impractical for room-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of beryllium as a dopant in diamond and highlight the potential of beryllium-nitrogen co-doping for achieving $n$-type diamond semiconductors.</p>

This approach enables accurate reconstruction of the DOS across a wide temperature range, allowing clear identification of shallow and deep trap levels and revealing thermally activated transport mechanisms. Simulated ToF currents are also used to evaluate the hole drift mobility under various thermal and field conditions. Activation energies are extracted from Arrhenius plots of the mobility data.

            <p>We study the learning dynamics of the soft committee machine (SCM) with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation using a statistical-mechanics approach within the annealed approximation. The SCM consists of a student network with $N$ input units and $K$ hidden units trained to reproduce the output of a teacher network with $M$ hidden units. We introduce a reduced set of macroscopic order parameters that yields a unified description valid from the conventional regime $K \ll N$ to the ultra-wide limit $K \ge N$. The control parameter $\alpha$, proportional to the ratio of training samples to adjustable weights, serves as an effective measure of dataset size. For small $\gamma = M/N$, we recover a continuous phase transition at $\alpha_{c} \approx 2\pi$ from an unspecialized, permutation-symmetric state to a specialized state in which student units align with the teacher. For finite $\gamma$, the transition disappears and the generalization error decreases smoothly with dataset size, reaching a low plateau when $\gamma=1$. In the asymptotic limit $\alpha \to \infty$, the error scales as $\varepsilon_{g} \propto 1/\alpha$, independent of $\gamma$ and $K$. The results highlight the central role of network dimensions in SCM learning and provide a framework extendable to other activations and quenched analyses.</p>

            <h2>Structure of the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in a ring: role of interaction asymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Tang, Guan-Hua Huang, Eugene Zaremba, Shizhong Zhang, Zhigang Wu</p>
            <p>The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.</p>

            <h2>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.A. Mousavi, A. Moshfeghi, F. Davoodian, E. Salahinejad</p>
            <p>Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</p>

            <h2>$p$-wave superconductivity and Josephson current in $p$-wave unconventional magnet/$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka</p>
            <p>We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective $p$-wave unconventional magnet model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems.</p>

            <h2>A voltage-responsive strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin network with emergent dynamics for computing</h2>

            <p>Emergent behavior, which arises from local interactions between simple elements, is pervasive in nature. It underlies the energy-efficient computing in our brains. However, realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge. While dipole-dipole interactions are typically suppressed in magnetic storage, here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients: strong dipolar coupling by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, and disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, intrinsic to strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions. It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable, low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.</p>

            <h2>Collective behavior of independent scaled Brownian particles with renewal resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ohad Vilk, Baruch Meerson</p>
            <p>We study collective dynamics of an ensemble of $N\gg 1$ independent particles undergoing anomalous diffusion with random renewal resetting. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H}$, where $H>0$. The particles independently reset to the origin, and each particle's clock is set to zero upon spatial resetting. Employing the known steady-state position distribution of a \emph{single} particle undergoing the sBm with renewal resetting [Bodrova et al., Phys. Rev. E \textbf{100}, 012120 (2019)], we study the collective dynamics of $N$ particles. We determine the statistics of the system radius $\ell$. The typical fluctuations of $\ell$ fall under the Gumbel universality class, and we use extreme value statistics to calculate the moments of $\ell$. We also study the large-deviation statistics of the center of mass (COM), where for $H>1/2$ we uncover an anomalous scaling behavior of the COM distribution, and a singularity in the corresponding rate function, due to a ``big jump" effect.</p>

            <h2>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Chen, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Bing-Xin Lao</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Multicritical quantum sensors driven by symmetry-breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Mondal, Ayan Sahoo, Ujjwal Sen, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>Quantum criticality has been demonstrated as a useful quantum resource for parameter estimation. This includes second-order, topological and localization transitions. In all these works reported so far, gap-to-gapless transition at criticality has been identified as a crucial resource for achieving the quantum-enhanced sensing, although there are several important concepts associated with criticality, such as long-range correlation, symmetry breaking. In this work, we show that symmetry-breaking alone can drive a quantum-enhanced sensing, even without any gap-to-gapless transition. We analytically demonstrate that the estimation of the superconducting pairing amplitude in the one-dimensional Kitaev model achieves Heisenberg scaling when the system is prepared near a multicritical point and is varied along a gapless critical line, implying symmetry breaking as a standalone metrological resource. Extending our analysis in the realm of simultaneous multiparameter estimation of both the pairing term and the chemical potential, we show that it is possible to obtain $L^6$ scaling in a narrow parameter range, but with definite observable consequence, where the quantum advantage is assisted by gap-to-gapless transition as well. Our work thus identifies a new resource for criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, and also suggests multicritical systems as useful platform for multiparameter sensing.</p>

            <p>We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Despite the complexity arising from many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetry enables the exact construction of a steady state that displays the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</p>

            <p>Imaging and hyperspectral data analysis is central to progress across biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The core challenge lies in converting high-resolution or high-dimensional datasets into interpretable representations that enable insight into the underlying physical or chemical properties of a system. Traditional analysis relies on expert-designed, multistep workflows, such as denoising, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolution, or on machine learning (ML) methods that accelerate individual steps. Both approaches, however, typically demand significant human intervention, including hyperparameter tuning and data labeling. Achieving the next level of autonomy in scientific imaging requires designing effective reward-based workflows that guide algorithms toward best data representation for human or automated decision-making. Here, we discuss recent advances in reward-based workflows for image analysis, which capture key elements of human reasoning and exhibit strong transferability across various tasks. We highlight how reward-driven approaches enable a shift from supervised black-box models toward explainable, unsupervised optimization on the examples of Scanning Probe and Electron Microscopies. Such reward-based frameworks are promising for a broad range of applications, including classification, regression, structure-property mapping, and general hyperspectral data processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Yu Zheng, Xueliang Wang, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis P. Clougherty</p>
            <p>Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Scott, Bryce Gadway, V. W. Scarola</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high-frequency pulses to dynamically design steady-state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a nonstroboscopic high-frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters: $R$ measuring right-oriented influence and $L$ measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</p>

Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</p>

            <p>Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations. When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle cluster.</p>

Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of Möbius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</p>

            <p>Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</p>

            <p>We develop a unified framework for computing Rényi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.</p>

Here, we examine strongly repulsive fermions on a ladder -- a minimal platform for unconventional $d$-wave pairing -- and show that flattening of the lower band through an additional diagonal hopping term produces non-Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by the violation of Luttinger's theorem, as well as axial $d$-wave pairing correlations. Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing. This offers broadly relevant insights for correlated flat-band systems, ranging from ultracold atoms to strongly interacting electrons in solids.</p>

            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p>

            <p>Silicon spin qubits offer long coherence times, a compact footprint and compatibility with industrial CMOS manufacturing. Here, we investigate spin qubits hosted in quantum dots fabricated in a state-of-the-art 300 mm nanoelectronics foundry and demonstrate substantially enhanced coherence, achieving a Hahn-echo time of $T_2^{\text{Hahn}} = 4\,\mathrm{ms}$ for singlet--triplet oscillations. Employing noise spectroscopy and noise correlation measurements, we identify detuning noise with an amplitude of $\delta \varepsilon_{\mathrm{rms}} = 2.2\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ (integrated over 90 s) and observe strong zero-phase correlations between two spatially separated spin qubits. The singlet--triplet basis intrinsically rejects these common-mode fluctuations, yielding a pronounced suppression of dephasing. Our results suggest that exploiting the versatility of silicon quantum dots to adapt the qubit encoding to the microscopic noise landscape represents a promising strategy for advancing scalable quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Bias, length, or coupling? What controls the quantum efficiency of electroluminescent single-polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Facundo Tarasi, Esteban D. Gadea, Tchavdar Todorov, Damian A. Scherlis</p>
            <p>Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Charge Transfer and Electronic Structure Modulation in Ultrathin Graphene P3HT Hybrid Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yosra Mater, Salih Demirci, V. Ongun Özçelik</p>
            <p>Ultrathin polymer-graphene heterostructures are promising materials for next generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic technologies, while the influence of the polymer's structural variation on interfacial charge transfer remains unclear. Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <h2>Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum Polarization in Thouless Topological Charge Pumping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esmaeil Taghizadeh Sisakht, Uiseok Jeong, Xiao jiang, Jinseok Oh, Yizhou Liu, Binghai Yan, Noejung Park</p>
            <p>Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingming Huang, Xiaofang Fu, Junlong Wu, Laifeng Li, Liang Qiao, Ye Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <p>An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states.

            <p>Spin-orbit torque efficiency is conventionally fixed by bulk materials. $D$-wave altermagnets introduce an additional nonrelativistic spin-charge conversion channel beyond inverse spin-Hall effect. Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry, describing the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function in momentum space, has recently been recognized as a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics. The flat-band system offers the paradigmatic platform where quantum geometry plays the essential role in correlated electron phases. However, systems that suffer from significant effects of quantum geometry are not limited to flat-band systems; dispersive-band systems also exhibit quantum condensed phases driven by quantum geometry. In this perspective, we provide a transparent account of quantum geometry and its role in correlated electron phases, throughout flat-band and dispersive-band systems.</p>

            <p>High-order anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is observed up to the 18th harmonic in cubic Fe(001) thin films, overturning the long-standing paradigm that only two- and four-fold terms are symmetry-allowed. Using angle-resolved transport and Fourier analysis, we show that six-fold and higher-order terms are intrinsic, tunable by temperature and thickness, and predicted by crystal symmetry. Microscopically, the two-fold sign reversal arises from a crossover between weak and strong scattering regimes, while high-order terms emerge from the interplay of anisotropic Fermi velocity and relaxation time. Our results establish high-order AMR as a symmetry-prescribed property of cubic ferromagnets, providing critical benchmarks for spin-orbit transport theory and enabling new angular-sensitive spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekulè superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</p>

            <p>We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations.

            <p>Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</p>

            <p>We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a unique multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90\degree$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and Néel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens other avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.</p>

            <p>Understanding how granular materials respond to shear stress remains a central challenge in soft matter physics. We report direct observations of persistent granular convection in the bulk shear zones of spherical particle packings -- a phenomenon previously associated primarily with particle shape anisotropy or boundary effects. By employing various bead-coloring techniques in a split-bottom geometry, we reveal internal flow fields within sheared granular packings. We find robust convection rolls, strikingly governed by system geometry: at low filling heights, two counter-rotating convection rolls emerge, while at higher filling heights, a single dominant convection roll forms, featuring radially outward flow at the surface. This transition is driven by the height-dependent broadening of the shear zone, which introduces shear rate asymmetry across its flanks. Notably, the transition occurs entirely within the open shear band regime. These findings underscore the pivotal role of system geometry in shaping secondary flow formation in dense packings of frictional particles, suggesting possible broader relevance to geophysical flow dynamics and industrial applications.</p>

            <p>Thanks to improved methods for numerical analytic continuation with constraints, spectral functions with sharp features can now be extracted from imaginary-time correlation functions computed by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,\omega)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,\tau)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,\omega)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</p>

Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry. Hence, our finding showcases a competition of different unconventional pairing channels, and demonstrates via a simple model how band geometry can induce fermionic pairing.

            <p>Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful variational framework for two-dimensional quantum matter and have been widely used to capture bosonic topological order, including chiral spin liquids. Here we extend this approach to \emph{fermionic} topological order by variationally optimizing $U(1)$-symmetric fermionic iPEPS for a fractional Chern insulator (FCI), with bond dimensions up to $D=9$. We find evidence for a critical bond dimension, above which the ansatz faithfully represents the FCI phase. The FCI state is characterized using bulk observables, including the equal-time single-particle Green's function and the pair-correlation function, as well as the momentum-resolved edge entanglement spectrum. To enable entanglement-spectrum calculations for large iPEPS unit cells, we introduce a compression scheme and show that the low-lying part of the spectrum is already well converged at relatively small cutoff dimensions.</p>

            <p>Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms.</p>

First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for Clean d-wave Superconductivity in Samarium Nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingming Huang, Xiaofang Fu, Junlong Wu, Laifeng Li, Liang Qiao, Ye Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of superconducting nickelates provides a unique opportunity to explore the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio Approach to Collective Excitations in Excitonic Insulators</h2>

            <p>An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states. Our work paves the way for quantitative predictions of excited state phenomena from first-principles calculations in electronic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p>

            <h2>Ferromagnetic interface engineering of spin-charge conversion in RuO$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongchao Yang, Zhaoqing Li, Yu Dai, Lili Lang, Zhong Shi, Zhe Yuan, Shi-Ming Zhou</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit torque efficiency is conventionally fixed by bulk materials. $D$-wave altermagnets introduce an additional nonrelativistic spin-charge conversion channel beyond inverse spin-Hall effect. Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel Schaub, Martinus H. V. Werts</p>
            <p>Multi-Tau Pulsed Illumination Differential Dynamic Microscopy (MTPI-DDM) is introduced as a method for significantly enhancing the time resolution of DDM. The technique employs simple, low-cost instrumentation comprising a single monochrome digital camera and a single pulsed LED. A timing sequence, based on a geometric progression of time lags, is used to generate a "multi-tau" scheme, providing high sampling density at short timescales where dynamics are fastest. In the current implementation, a temporal resolution of 80 $\mu$s is achieved, limited by the dead time of the camera electronics. Validation of MTPI-DDM was performed by measuring the diffusion of 99 nm polystyrene nanoparticles in water. Compared to conventional continuous-wave (CW) DDM, the pulsed approach extends the range of the shortest measurable time lags by nearly two orders of magnitude and enhances DDM signal amplitudes by eliminating motion blur.</p>

            <p>High-order anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is observed up to the 18th harmonic in cubic Fe(001) thin films, overturning the long-standing paradigm that only two- and four-fold terms are symmetry-allowed. Using angle-resolved transport and Fourier analysis, we show that six-fold and higher-order terms are intrinsic, tunable by temperature and thickness, and predicted by crystal symmetry. Microscopically, the two-fold sign reversal arises from a crossover between weak and strong scattering regimes, while high-order terms emerge from the interplay of anisotropic Fermi velocity and relaxation time. Our results establish high-order AMR as a symmetry-prescribed property of cubic ferromagnets, providing critical benchmarks for spin-orbit transport theory and enabling new angular-sensitive spintronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekulè superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</p>

            <p>We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations.

            <p>Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhikbrata Sarkar, Daniel Loss</p>
            <p>We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,\mu$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Enforced Topological Chiral Fermions in Amorphous Chiral Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin Schirmann, Adolfo G. Grushin, Benjamin J. Wieder</p>
            <p>Since the prediction and observation of topological Weyl semimetals (chiral TSMs), there have been enormous efforts to characterize further condensed matter realizations of chiral fermions. These efforts were dramatically accelerated by the subsequent discovery of a profound link between low-energy topological and lattice chirality in structurally chiral crystals. Though TSMs are well understood in the limit of perfect translation symmetry, real solid-state materials host defects and disorder, and may even be rendered amorphous down to all but the smallest system length scales. Previous theoretical studies have concluded that chiral TSMs transition into trivial diffusive metals at moderate disorder scales, raising concerns that chiral TSM states may only be accessible in highly crystalline samples. In this work, we in contrast identify large families of chiral TSMs that persist under strong structural disorder - even into the amorphous regime. We show that amorphous chiral TSM phases can in particular be stabilized by the presence of long-range order in the local structural chirality. We present extensive analytic and numerical calculations demonstrating the existence of both Weyl and higher-charge chiral fermions in amorphous metals whose topology and spin and orbital angular momentum textures are tunable via the interplay of average symmetry and geometry. To distinguish and generate new realizations of strongly disordered chiral fermions, we introduce an analytic approach grounded in symmetry group theory. We then introduce an amorphous Wilson loop numerical method to characterize chiral fermions with quantized Berry curvature fluxes in metals with 3D structural disorder. Our findings bridge the crystalline and strongly disordered regimes of chiral TSMs, and indicate a clear route towards engineering geometry-enforced topology in non-crystalline materials and metamaterials.</p>

            <h2>All-to-All interactions via multifractal wavefunction geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> YouYoung Joung, Jemin Park, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.</p>

Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.</p>

            <p>Thanks to recent experimental advances in simulating and detecting quantum dynamics with high precision and controllability, our understanding of the physics of monitored quantum systems has considerably deepened over the past decades. In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.</p>

An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders. Our schemes provide realistic platforms to implement Majorana zero modes, paving the way for studying the Majorana physics.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.</p>

            <p>The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of Néel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.</p>

            <p>Hyperbolic metamaterials enable extreme light confinement and control of photonic states, but their realization has been restricted to inorganic architectures. Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>We build a minimal theoretical model to describe the opening of a gap in the dispersion of the collective excitations of a driven-dissipative condensate when the condensate phase is fixed by an additional coherent phase-locking drive. We map out the phase diagram as a function of the frequency and the strength of the coherent drive. We identify regions where the gap is purely imaginary or has a finite real part. When the coherent drive is unable to lock the condensate phase, a gapless Goldstone mode is recovered in the Floquet-Bogoliubov dispersion of collective modes. We finally characterize regions of finite-wavevector dynamical instability, where the condensate tends to develop a supersolid-like spatial modulation. While our theoretical framework is directly related to recent experiments with exciton-polariton condensates, it can be applied to describe the effect of external injection also in a variety of spatially extended optical parametric oscillators or laser devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Optoelectronically Directed Self-Assembly of Active and Passive Particles into Programmable and Reconfigurable Colloidal Structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donggang Cao, Sankha Shuvra Das, Gilad Yossifon</p>
            <p>Controlled assembly of active-passive colloidal mixtures offers a route to reconfigurable microscale machines, but their self-assembly pathways remain poorly understood. We study the directed assembly of metallo-dielectric Janus particles (JPs) and passive polystyrene (PS) beads using optoelectrically reconfigurable AC-field patterning, which allows precise control over particle composition and binding sequence. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and simulations, we show that dipolar interactions drive robust JP-JP and JP-PS dimer formation with frequency-dependent stability. At intermediate and high frequencies, JP-PS binding is strongly attractive, whereas at low frequencies it becomes effectively repulsive due to electrical double-layer screening and electrohydrodynamic flows at the metallic hemisphere. In multi-particle systems, PS beads act as cooperative hubs that hierarchically recruit JPs, yielding higher-order hybrid structures. We identify structural isomers - for example, 3JP + 1PS clusters can form chain-like or triangular configurations depending on assembly sequence. Simulations confirm both as equilibrium states, with the triangular isomer slightly more stable. Similar polymorphism appears in larger clusters (4JPs). Overall, we establish a framework for controlled active-passive colloidal assembly, showing how frequency-tunable interactions and structural polymorphism enable the design of reconfigurable colloidal machines for applications in microrobotics, targeted delivery, and adaptive materials.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.</p>

            <p>Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.</p>

            <p>We develop theoretical methods to predict the effects of paramagnetic impurities on the microwave response of conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Our focus is on superconducting devices and resonators with low concentrations of impurities and exchange interactions with conduction electrons. We connect the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum generated by pair-breaking to the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity for superconductors operating at microwave frequencies. We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder.</p>

            <p>The literature on experimentally verified material properties of tritium is sparse but information about this is crucial in fusion for pellet production (Magnetic Confined Fusion), target fueling (Inertial Confined Fusion), cryogenic distillation, as well as in astroparticle physics for neutrino experiments, and search for rare physics. To improve on this, the T$_2$ApIR experiment has been designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), and is in its scientific commissioning phase. The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated. This is achieved using a cryogenic setup capable of reaching less than 10 in a measurement cell that allows optical access for infrared absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and a polariscope setup, as well as temperature and pressure measurement.</p>

            <h2>Learning transitions of topological surface codes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Finn Eckstein, Bo Han, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaohui Zhi, Qingyun Qian, Jin-Guo Liu, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.</p>

Here, we study information scrambling in strongly disordered spin systems with power-law interactions via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Haneder, Gerrit Caspari, Juan Diego Urbina, Klaus Richter</p>
            <p>Out-of-Time-Ordered Commutators (OTOCs), representing a key diagnostic for scrambling as a facet of short-time quantum chaos, have attracted wide-ranging interest, from many-body physics to quantum gravity. By means of a suitable form of the Wigner-Moyal expansion, and invoking ensemble equivalence in statistical physics, we provide a consistent approach to the growth rate of the OTOC for many-body systems with chaotic classical limit where both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the quantum nature of the density of states enter. Applying this construction to quantized high-dimensional hyperbolic motion, i.e., a quantum chaotic system that exhibits gravity-like correlation functions in the late-time regime, we compute the OTOC growth rate $\Lambda$ as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $f$, and inverse temperature, $\beta$. We show that the scaled growth rate, $\Lambda/f$, can be described by a universal function of $f \beta$ and displays a cross-over from classical to quantum behavior as we increase $f$ and/or lower the temperature. In the deep quantum regime of infinite $f$, we find maximally fast scrambling in the sense of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. This elucidates the non-perturbative mechanism underlying the saturation of the bound via quantum contributions to the mean density of states, and it provides further support for this dynamical system as a dual to two-dimensional quantum gravity. In this way, we present first evidence of maximally fast scrambling in a quantum chaotic system with a well-defined classical Hamiltonian limit, without invoking any external mechanism such as (disorder) averaging.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Tensor in the Wild: Resolving Stokes Phenomena via Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prasoon Saurabh</p>
            <p>Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian physics has unlocked a wealth of unconventional wave phenomena beyond the reach of Hermitian systems, with exceptional points (EPs) driving enhanced sensitivity, nonreciprocal transport, and topological behavior unique to non-Hermitian degeneracies. Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamic inference from coarse observations remains a key challenge. Memory, in particular correlations between consecutively observed mesostates, blur signatures of irreversibility and must be accounted for in defining physical time-reversal, which remains an open problem. We derive an experimentally accessible k-th order estimator for the entropy production rate. Using novel measure-theoretic techniques we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteed lower bounds on the dissipation even in the strongly non-Markovian setting. The proof reveals that estimators saturated in the order unravel the duration of memory which needs to be considered in defining physically consistent time-reversal. We show that Markovian estimators in absence of a time-scale separation lead to artifacts, which convey no physical meaning. Similarly, estimators not saturated in the order may overestimate the dissipation. The necessity of correctly accounting for memory in thermodynamic inference from strongly non-Markovian observations underscores the still underappreciated challenges and intricacies in defining and understanding irreversibility in presence of memory. Our results will hopefully stimulate experiments systematically considering thermodynamic inference on multiple scales consistently accounting for memory.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the semiconducting magnet CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, emerging in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum correlations. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr. Specially, it can encounter a sign change from attractive to repulsive interactions when the intrinsic antiferromagnetic order transforms to the forced ferromagnetic order. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of random pinned disorder on a collection of self propelled particles. To achieve this, we construct a continuum model by formulating the coupled hydrodynamic equations for slow variables, local density and momentum density of particles. The disorder in the system acts as pinning sites, effectively immobilizing the particles that come into contact with them. Our numerical results reveal that weak disorder leads to phase separation in the system at density and activity lower than the typical values for motility induced phase separation. We construct a phase diagram using numerical simulations as well as linearized approximation in the plane of activity and packing fraction of particles at weak disorder densities. On increasing disorder density the system shows the Micro phase separation, while at large disorder densities, the system becomes heterogeneous and eventually undergoes kinetic arrest. The structure factor tail deviates from the Porods law, indicating increased roughness at domain interfaces under strong disorder. Furthermore, we analyze the fractal dimension of the interface as a function of disorder density, highlighting the increasing irregularity of phase separated domains. We also found that disorder significantly suppresses number fluctuations in the system.</p>

            <p>An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy wells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each other by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the particles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated interactions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity to harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite viscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and experiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated particles can access four distinct dynamical states, two of which are emergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently active steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a classical time crystal.</p>

            <p>Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momentum space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.</p>

            <p>The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, i.e. linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions. We show that the U in LRT and cRPA can differ as much as 30%. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from two main differences: neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and additional excitation channels in LRT. By taking these differences into account, we can achieve near perfect agreement between the two techniques. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work formally connects both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.</p>

            <p>Using Migdal-Eliashberg theory implemented in Electron Phonon Wannier (EPW) code, we have investigated anisotropic superconductivity in a ternary boride $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$. It is a single-gap, anisotropic, phonon-mediated superconductor having a critical temperature $\mathrm{T_c}\sim \, 19.3$ K. A dominant contribution to superconductivity arises from the robust coupling between electronic states, primarily created by the $\mathrm{d_{xy}}$,$\mathrm{d_{x^2 - y^2}}$ orbitals of Mo atoms and the in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms. A weak Fermi surface nesting and a small electron-phonon coupling cannot induce charge density wave-like instabilities, as evidenced by the lack of a significant peak in the real part of the total Lindhard susceptibility and the absence of phonon softening. Furthermore, we have studied its electronic and superconducting properties under hydrostatic pressure up to 76.69 GPa, owing to its low bulk modulus and metastability. The persistent reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, Fermi surface nesting and the stiffening of phonon modes lead to a diminution of superconductivity under pressure up to 59.71 GPa. At 76.69 GPa, a modification in the topology of the Fermi surface, namely a Lifshitz transition, occurs resulting in a sudden enhancement of nesting. This enhanced nesting, in turn, induces an abrupt stabilisation of superconductivity at 76.69 GPa, resulting in a V-shaped response to pressure.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that is inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Maire, Andrea Plati, Frank Smallenburg, Giuseppe Foffi</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which undergo a transition from a state of purely vertical motion to one characterized by horizontal diffusion as the density increases. Numerical simulations reveal that, depending on the specific system parameters, both continuous and discontinuous transitions can occur, each associated with markedly distinct structural properties at the transition point. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to an effective 2D model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hybrid metal halide perovskites combine strong spin-orbit coupling, soft lattice dynamics and molecular tunability, making them promising platforms for chiral optoelectronics and spin dependent phenomena. While chiral organic spacers are known to induce optical activity, the microscopic mechanism by which molecular chirality couples to the inorganic lattice remains unclear. Here, we investigate coherent vibrational dynamics in the chiral perovskite ($R$-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$ and its racemic analogue using transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by Raman spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations. We identify a coherent phonon at ~5.7 meV that couples strongly to excitons in the chiral material but is absent in the racemic counterpart. This mode is assigned to lattice vibrations involving coupled motion of the chiral spacer and Pb-I framework, including rotational displacement patterns. These results establish coherent lattice motion as a pathway for mediating chiral responses in hybrid materials.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absence of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points with zero energy locate symmetrically with respect to Josephson phase difference $\phi=\pi$, at which a Majorana zero mode persists. Notably, the exceptional points descend from a pair of Majorana zero modes after turning on the non-Hermiticity and are topologically protected. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to a mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ. Our results provide new insights on transport properties of Josephson junctions in presence of Majorana zero modes, exceptional points, and non-Hermiticity.</p>

            <h2>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toma Yoneya, Kazuya Fujimoto, Yuki Kawaguchi</p>
            <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</p>

            <p>Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. The pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic density of states. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moiré pattern -- a moiré of moirés. The super-moiré of MnBr$_2$/Gr/Ir(110) is unique, as it involves a virtual moiré of MnBr$_2$ with the Ir(110) surface lattice -- two lattices not in contact with each other. Using a careful Fourier analysis, the known properties of Gr/Ir(110), and the results of ab initio calculations, the origin of the virtual moiré is uncovered and related to the inhomogeneous binding of Gr to Ir(110). Comparative experiments with MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(111) show similar growth and structure, but highlight the unique properties of the MnBr$_2$/Gr/Ir(110) super-moiré.</p>

            <h2>The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talia Baravi, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fréchet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fréchet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.</p>

By semi-classical quantum electrodynamics, we study ground state dispersion forces for cylindrical dielectric nanorods made of polystyrene (PS), and zinc oxide (ZnO) embedded in toluene-based host media with gold-coated magnetite nanoparticles and also predict magnetic contributions to the non-retarded excited state interaction. The variation in magnetic permeability enables tuning between repulsive and attractive interaction and a thermally unstable and measurable magnetic Casimir traps are predicted between a pair of ZnO-PS nanoparticles whose equilibrium position can be modulated over an order of magnitude with a small variation in the size of the magnetite nanoparticle. This provides an alternative magnetic Casimir-effect pathway to reversibly tune quantum electromagnetic forces at the nanoscale for assembly and enhancement of colloidal stability.</p>

Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.

            <p>Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moiré systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.</p>

            <p>For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</p>

The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism.

We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</p>

            <p>Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zoran Milosavljevic</p>
            <p>MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites.</p>

Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $\nu = 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $\nu = p/(2p+1)$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Lars R. Schreiber, Thomas Koprucki, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $\mu$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.</p>

            <p>In this article, we explain the reason of the apparent contradiction between recent experiments [1] and [2] and earlier theoretical predictions [3] of strongly asymmetric condensate resulting in attractive interaction between the condensate magnons. We show that the relaxation time for equilibrium between two condensates at two minima of energy exceeds the time of experiment. Therefore, it should be described by Boltzmann kinetic equation. We develop the proper kinetic theory and find the relation between the critical pumping power and the effective temperature of over-condensate magnons.</p>

            <p>Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Functional Properties of Manganese Pnictides: A First-Principles Study on Magneto-Optics and Magnetocaloric Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayendran S, Abhishek K G, Suresh R, Helmer Fjellvåg, Ravindran P</p>
            <p>Magnetic refrigeration presents an energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternative to traditional vapour-compression cooling technologies. It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Line Jelver, Joel D. Cox</p>
            <p>Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Bahari, Kristian Mæland, Carsten Timm, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</p>

            <p>Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological nodal lines, Weyl points, and a three-fold degeneracy in its magnon band structure. The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, allowing further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems, and highlighting the rich interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</p>

            <p>Niobium and its alloys with early transition metals have been extensively studied for their excellent superconducting properties. They have high transition temperatures, strong upper critical fields, and high critical current densities, making them ideal for superconducting applications such as SQUIDs, MRI, NMR, particle accelerators, and Qubits. Here we report a systematic investigation of as-cast Nb-rich alloys, Nb$_{0.85}$X$_{0.15}$ (X = Ti, Zr, Hf), using magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. They exhibit strong type-II bulk superconductivity with moderate superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical fields. The estimated magnetic field-dependent critical current density lies in the range of 10$^5$--10$^6$~A/cm$^2$ across various temperatures, while the corresponding flux-pinning force density is on the order of GNm$^{-3}$, suggesting the potential of these materials for practical applications. Electronic-specific heat data reveal a strongly coupled, single, isotropic, nodeless superconducting gap.

By employing the B3LYP functional and implicit solvent models, the field dependent adsorption energetics, frontier orbitals and electrostatic potentials are calculated on a nickel surface. Key findings reveal that while saccharinate dominates in bulk plating baths, its strong solvation shell impedes surface adsorption.

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Blume-Capel Model with Antisymmetric Single-Ion Anisotropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjun R, Pratyush Prakash Patra, A. V. Anil Kumar</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between nonreciprocal interactions and chemical-potential imbalance in a two-species nonreciprocal Blume-Capel model. Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $\Delta_\alpha = - \Delta_\beta$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $\alpha$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour.</p>

We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction.

            <p>Realizing non-volatile control of superconductivity is a key step toward integrating memory and quantum functionality in future information technologies. KTaO_3-based heterostructures uniquely host both interfacial two-dimensional superconductivity and a quantum paraelectric lattice background. The coupling between these two degrees of freedom potentially provides a promising route to encode memory directly into the superconducting state. Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization. These results demonstrate reconfigurable and non-volatile superconductivity at correlated oxide interfaces, opening a pathway to combine dissipationless transport with non-volatility for superconducting neuromorphic elements.</p>

            <p>In this work we develop constitutive equations for a dense, sheared suspension of frictionally interacting rods by applying Onsager's variational method as formulated by Doi. We treat both solid friction, of the Amontons-Coulomb form; and lubricated friction, which scales with relative tangential velocity at the contact point. Dissipation functions in terms of the rod angular velocity are derived via a mean field approach for each form of friction, and from these, a Rayleighian for dense suspensions of rigid rods under shear constructed. Derivatives of this Rayleighian with respect to rod angular velocity and velocity gradient give a Smoluchowski equation and stress tensor, respectively. We show that these are representable as perturbations to Doi's model for a sheared liquid crystal. We also suggest a form for the average number of contacts between rods as a function of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and nematic order parameter, generalizing Philipse's random contact equation for disordered packings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Lizalde-Arroyo, Frederik Van Loock, Victoria Bernardo, Miguel Angel Rodriguez-Perez, Judith Martin-de Leon</p>
            <p>Nanocellular polyetherimide exhibits significant improvements in mechanical properties like toughness and impact resistance, commonly associated with the presence of nanoporosity. However, this work demonstrates these enhancements, often measured directly after processing, cannot be fully explained solely by the cellular structure but also originate from a modification of the polymer matrix induced by the CO2-saturation process. Through a systematic study involving thermal treatments and saturation-desorption processes without foaming, it is shown that CO2 exposure, even in the absence of pore formation, induces an apparent rejuvenation of the polymer, as evidenced by a reduction in the yield stress, which persists after complete CO2 desorption and in the absence of residual gas during mechanical testing. Therefore, the observed ductile response is not associated with the presence of CO2 during deformation, but with a permanent modification of the polymer matrix induced by prior gas exposure. This structural state can be thermally reversed by activating the beta relaxation of the polymer. For nanocellular polymers, the presence of residual gas within the matrix during foaming restricts thermal relaxation and helps preserve the CO2-modified state. As a result, the mechanical response of the solid phase reflects the intrinsic properties of the saturated polymer and the architecture imposed by the cellular structure. This work demonstrates for the first time that CO2 saturation can permanently alter the mechanical state of a high-Tg amorphous polymer, providing a new framework to interpret the brittle-to-ductile transition in nanocellular PEI.</p>

            <p>The possibility of a zero temperature, altermagnetic instability in anisotropic two dimensional electron systems in the diffusive regime is analyzed, in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling. Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. W. F. Venderbos</p>
            <p>Condensed matter physics is often concerned with determining the response of a solid to an external stimulus. This paper revisits and extends the microscopic formalism for calculating response coefficients -- here referred to as (generalized) polarizabilities -- in crystalline electronic insulators. The main focus is on the Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization, for which we obtain general formulas describing the linear response to an arbitrary (but static and uniform) perturbation. The response of an arbitrary lattice-periodic observable (e.g. spin, layer pseudospin) to electric and magnetic fields is also examined, and serves as a basis for mircoscopically establishing Maxwell relations between conjugate generalized polarizabilities. We furthermore introduce and examine the notion of Berry curvature or Hall vector polarizability, i.e., the response of the Berry curvature to a general perturbation, and show how it relates to Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization responses. For all polarizabilities considered, we obtain simplified formulas applicable to two- and four-band models, expressed directly in terms of the Hamiltonian and the perturbation. Three specific applications of these formulas are discussed: (i) a computation of the magnetoelectric polarizabilities of model antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions; (ii) a general proof of (quasi)topological signatures in the polarizabilities of Dirac fermions in two dimensions; (iii) a calculation of the strain-induced Berry curvature polarizability in an altermagnet.</p>

Structural optimization of the trees based on time evolution of the entanglement in the system allows to keep the necessary bond dimensions low and to maximally exploit the increased expressiveness of TTNs over MPS. In this way, we achieve more accurate results in all considered parameter regimes both below and above the ergodicity-to-localization crossover at a comparable compute-time cost.</p>

            <p>Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</p>

            <p>The effects of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain on the $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{yy}$ components of the resistivity tensor, and the commensurable-nearly commensurate CDW (CCDW-NCCDW) transition temperature in 1T-TaS$_2$ are studied. At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states.</p>

            <p>Chemical and biological networks can describe a wide variety of processes, from gene regulatory networks to biochemical oscillations. Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes.</p>

            <p>We investigate the influence of magnetic order on the proximity-induced superconducting state in the Mn layers of a Mn-Nb(110) heterostructure by using a first-principles method. For this study, we use the recently developed Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) solver for superconducting heterostructures [Csire et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s.</p>

            <h2>2D coherent spectroscopy signatures of exciton condensation in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyu Chen, Jernej Mravlje, Denis Golež, Philipp Werner</p>
            <p>We show that the nonlinear optical response probed by two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can discriminate between excitonic and lattice driven order. In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.</p>

            <h2>Topological cluster synchronization via Dirac spectral programming on directed hypergraphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yupeng Guo, Ahmed A. A. Zaid, Xueming Liu, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems.</p>

            <p>Developing fault-tolerant quantum processors with error correction demands large arrays of physical qubits whose key performance metrics (coherence times, control fidelities) must remain within specifications over both short and long timescales. Here we investigated the temporal stability of subtractively fabricated CMOS-compatible superconducting transmon qubits. During a single cooldown and over a period of 95 hours, we monitored several parameters for 8 qubits, including coherence times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, which exhibit fluctuations originating primarily from the interaction between two-level system (TLS) defects and the host qubit. We also demonstrate that subtractively-fabricated superconducting quantum devices align with the theoretical predictions that higher mean lifetimes $T_1$ correspond to larger fluctuations. To assess long-term stability, we tracked two representative qubits over 10 cooldown cycles spanning more than one year. We observed an average total downward shift in both qubit transition frequencies of approximately 61 MHz within the thermal cycles considered. In contrast, readout resonator frequencies decreased only marginally. Meanwhile, $T_1$ exhibits fluctuations from cycle to cycle, but maintains a stable baseline value.</p>

            <p>Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate multiscale Gibbs measures from a variational and probabilistic viewpoint, focusing on the structural asymmetry among conditional entropies that characterizes their construction. We show how this asymmetry emerges both from variational principles with entropic constraints and from stochastic processes with reinforcement. We thus introduce the reinforced multinomial process and prove a large-deviation principle for its empirical histogram. The associated rate function reproduces precisely the entropy imbalance defining multiscale measures, thereby providing a genuine probabilistic mechanism for their emergence. The reinforced multinomial process thus offers a simple and rigorous stochastic foundation for multiscale Gibbs structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno H. S. Mendonça, Elizane E. de Moraes, Hélio Chacham</p>
            <p>Water nanoconfinement is known to occur inside material void spaces, such as 2D confinement between surfaces, 1D confinement inside nanotubes, and variable-dimension confinement inside nanoporous materials. In the present work we investigate, through molecular dynamics simulations, the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficient of water channels that are nanoconfined in the void space between adjacent surfaces of nanotube bundles - an existing class of materials. In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes. Interestingly, as we decrease the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm, the self-diffusion coefficients of the 1D channels increase by tenfold for hydrophilic surfaces and by sixfold for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing, in both cases, the bulk water values. We also investigated the water channels at the interstitial voids of the bulk bundle material, finding 1D water channels that are similar to the surface ones.</p>

            <p>The quantum dissipative time evolution of a fluxonium under a pulsed field (kicks) is studied numerically and analytically. In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor. Possible experimental realisations of this quantum strange attractor with fluxonium are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas M Payne, Furqan Alabdullah, Paola Borri, Wolfgang Langbein</p>
            <p>Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. Evaluation the distribution of the fit error across the set of measured particles, the material permittivity dataset and surface damping parameter g providing the best fit are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86, 235147 (2012)] and g = 1.8, respectively. The precision of the retrieved aspect ratio is below 5%, and all three ellipsoidal semi-axes are determined with an impressive precision of 0.25 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, and taking them into account improves the accuracy to below a nanometer.</p>

            <p>Noisy monitored quantum circuits have emerged as a versatile and unifying framework connecting quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and quantum computation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in understanding the dynamics of such circuits, with an emphasis on their entanglement structure, information-protection capabilities, and noise-induced phase transitions. A central theme is the mapping to classical statistical models, which reveals how quantum noise reshapes dominant spin configurations. This framework elucidates universal scaling behaviors, including the characteristic $q^{-1/3}$ entanglement scaling with noise probability $q$ and distinct timescales for information protection. We further highlight a broad range of constructions and applications inspired by noisy monitored circuits, spanning variational quantum algorithms, classical simulation methods, mixed-state phases of matter, and emerging approaches to quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction. These developments collectively establish noisy monitored circuits as a powerful platform for probing and controlling quantum dynamics in realistic, decohering environments.</p>

            <p>The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.</p>

            <p>We study DC and AC thermoelectric and magneto-transport in 2D quantum critical theories with strong translational symmetry breaking due to a % varying chemical potential lattice with zero average $\bar{\mu}=0$. The combination of quantum criticality and the absence of the average natural scale implies that such systems have idiosyncratic signatures that may apply more generally when the variance in the lattice potential far exceeds the average or for strong translational symmetry breaking in general. We model such theories holographically through near-extremal AdS black holes. We find that these systems (a) become \emph{better} conductors. In a 2D lattice, this can be explained by currents flowing around obstacles; (b) exhibit bad-metal electrical transport with Drude-like thermal transport, though it is not Drude, and, notably, (c) display an approximately $B$-linear longitudinal magnetoresistance at large fields, similar to Effective Medium Theory. We comment on how these results may apply when $\bar{\mu}\neq 0$.</p>

            <p>We show that the semiclassical limit of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations naturally reconstructs the algebro-geometric spectra of finite-gap periodic potentials. This correspondence is illustrated using the traveling-wave (snoidal) solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it.</p>

            <h2>Partition Function Estimation Using Analog Quantum Processors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Le, Elijah Pelofske</p>
            <p>We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>One of the critical challenges in enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells is reducing the density of trap states in the light-absorbing perovskite layer. These trap states lead to increased charge carrier recombination, thus dropping device efficiency. Space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis serves as a valuable method to study trap density, requiring structures capable of selectively transporting either electrons or holes. By analyzing current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and identifying the voltage at which the slope changes, trap density can be calculated effectively. Traditional organic polymer hole transport layers such as Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA face challenges, including moisture instability, low charge mobility, low conductivity, and high costs. This work introduces a novel hole-only device structure utilizing inorganic materials, offering improved stability, straightforward fabrication, and reduced costs compared to conventional structures. This device comprises a nanostructured NiOx layer, a perovskite layer, a copper indium selenide (CIS) layer, and an Au electrode on an ITO substrate. The performance of this structure is assessed by fabricating various perovskite layers under different experimental conditions. The trap density was successfully determined using the proposed hole-only device structure. Analysis of the photovoltaic properties revealed a clear correlation between trap density in the perovskite layers and the overall performance of the solar cells.</p>

            <p>The crystallographic orientation of films grown on 2D-masked substrates is often used to infer the pathway among remote, van der Waals, and thru-hole (pinhole-seeded) epitaxy. However, attribution of a specific growth mechanism based on orientation can be ambiguous unless mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment are evaluated within a single process window. We compare GaN grown under identical conditions on four m-plane sapphire templates: (i) bare, (ii) "graphene-grown" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 on), (iii) "anneal-only" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 off), and (iv) graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced on pristine sapphire. GaN selects (103) on graphene-grown and anneal-only m-plane sapphire, selects (100) on bare m-plane sapphire, and is predominantly (100) with a minority (103) on graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced/pristine m-plane sapphire. High-resolution TEM shows that, on partly graphene-covered samples, nucleation occurs on exposed sapphire (thru-hole), not on graphene, providing mechanism evidence independent of orientation. Within this window, the substrate surface state set by high-temperature Ar/H2 pre-treatment (rather than mask continuity) primarily governs orientation, while open-area effects can play a secondary role. Thus, preferred orientation alone may not determine the growth mechanism; mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment must be explicitly controlled when using orientation as evidence for mechanism assignment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koretaka Yuge, Yutaro Sakamoto</p>
            <p>For classical discrete systems under constant composition (specifically substitutional alloys), canonical average acts as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to a set of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, which is generally nonlinear. In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We reveal that the extended nonlinearity for nonequilibrium state is bounded from upper and lower by the information about one of the optimal Renyi divergences for equilibrium states in between practical and linear systems, and temperature and work.</p>

            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <p>We study from \textit{ab~initio} density functional theory calculations the structural and magnetic properties of the crystal KCoF$_3$. We found that the experimentally reported cubic to tetragonal phase transition is due to an electronic first-order Jahn-Teller effect from the R zone boundary point. We also obtain that the magnetic ground state is the G-type antiferromagnetic order, in agreement with the R-point Jahn-Teller distortion and that the magnetic moment of the Co atoms contains a strong orbital contribution ($m_L=0.95$ $\mu_B$ in the cubic phase and 0.55 $\mu_B$ in the tetragonal phase). Furthermore, we compute the dynamical magnetic effective charges and show that it is zero by symmetry for the Co and they can reach a value as large as 200 $10^{-2}\mu_{\text{B}}/\text{Å}$ for the apical F anion. This large magnetic effective charge comes from the spin-orbit coupling (50\% of the response is from the orbital moment) contrary to the rare-earth manganites and ferrites with similar order of magnitude but originating from the exchange striction mechanism. The fact that the dynamical magnetic effective charges are non-zero also proves that the tetragonal phase of KCoF$_3$ is antimagnetoelectric with a large magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. We also discuss the generality of these magnetic effective charges.</p>

            <p>In genuine nonequilibrium systems that undergo continuous driving, the thermodynamic forces are nonconservative, meaning they cannot be described by any free energy potential. Nonetheless, we show that the dynamics of such systems are governed by a "generalized free energy" that is derived from a large-deviations variational principle. This variational principle also yields a decomposition of fluxes, forces, and dissipation (entropy production) into a conservative "excess" part and a nonconservative "housekeeping" part. Our decomposition is universally applicable to stochastic master equations, deterministic chemical reaction networks, and open systems. We also show that the excess entropy production obeys a thermodynamic speed limit (TSL), a fundamental thermodynamic constraint on the rate of state evolution and/or external fluxes. We demonstrate our approach on several examples, including real-world metabolic networks, where we derive fundamental dissipation bounds and uncover "futile" metabolic cycles. Our generalized free energy and decomposition are empirically accessible to thermodynamic inference in both stochastic and deterministic systems. We discuss important connections to several theoretical frameworks, including information geometry and Onsager theory, as well as previous excess/housekeeping decompositions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zesheng Zhang, Xin-Zhi Li, Wen-Yu He</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect is a new type of Hall effect that has recently attracted significant attention. For the physical origin of the nonlinear Hall effect, while orbital magnetization has long been hypothesized to underpin the nonlinear Hall effect, a general relation between the two quantities remains elusive. Here, we resolve the problem by deriving the first explicit formula connecting the electric field induced orbital magnetization to the second order Hall conductivity. Our theory reveals that the applied electric field plays dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect: it first generates nonequlibrium orbital magnetization associated with an edge current, and subsequently perturbs the circulating edge states to produce transverse Hall voltage. For the experimental verification, we propose to apply a combination of direct and alternative currents to identify the circulating edge current in the nonlinear Hall effect. Based on the orbital magnetization origin, we point out that in isotropic chiral metals of T and O point groups, the crystalline symmetry suppresses the nonlinear Hall response for a monochromatic linear polarized electric field, but a non-collinear bichromatic electric field can generate a finite nonlinear Hall current that manifests the chiral correlation of the field. This discovery finally enables us to incorporate both the nonlinear Hall effect and circular photo-galvanic effect into the framework of orbital magnetization.</p>

Analyzing the effects of electronic correlations on the lowest-order electron-phonon processes, we show that in the proximity of the Mott metal-to-insulator transition of the doped square lattice Hubbard model, where the isothermal charge response becomes particularly large at small momenta, the coupling of electrons to the lattice is strongly increased. This, in turn, induces significant corrections to both the electronic self-energy and phonon-mediated pairing interaction, indicating the possible onset of a strong interplay between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom even for small values of the bare electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <h2>Optically Controlled Topological Phases in the Deformed $α-T_{3}$ Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Othmane Benhaida, El Hassan Saidi, L. B. Drissi</p>
            <p>Haldane's tight-binding model, which describes a Chern insulator in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, exhibits quantum Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field. Here, we explore an $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattice subjected to circularly polarized off-resonance light. This lattice, composed of two sublattices (A and B) and a central site (C) per unit cell, undergoes deformation by varying the hopping parameter $\gamma _{1}$ while keeping $\gamma _{2}$= $\gamma _{3}$= $\gamma $. Analytical expressions for quasi-energies in the first Brillouin zone reveal significant effects of symmetry breaking. Circularly polarized light lifts the degeneracy of Dirac points, shifting the cones from M. This deformation evolves with $\gamma _{1} $, breaking symmetry at $\gamma _{1}=2\gamma $, as observed in Berry curvature diagrams. In the standard case ($\gamma _{1}=\gamma $), particle-hole and inversion symmetries are preserved for $\alpha =0$ and $% \alpha =1$. The system transitions from a semi-metal to a Chern insulator, with band-specific Chern numbers: $C_{2}=1$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-1$ for $% \alpha <1/\sqrt{2},$ shifting to $C_{2}=2$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-2$ when $% \alpha \geqslant 1/\sqrt{2}.$For $\gamma _{1}>2\gamma $, the system enters a trivial insulating phase. These transitions, confirmed via Wannier charge centers, are accompanied by a diminishing Hall conductivity. Our findings highlight tunable topological phases in $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattices, driven by light and structural deformation, with promising implications for quantum materials.</p>

The BSE matrix is constructed with the Yambo code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing Yambo with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the Hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-Hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-Hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters.

            <h2>Modulation of Polarization and Metallicity in Janus Sliding Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Mahajan, Awadhesh Narayan</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is emerging as a distinct and promising mechanism for realizing ferroelectricity in low-dimensional systems, offering new design principles beyond the conventional ferroelectric mechanism. Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katerina Mlada, Michal Pavelka, Vaclav Klika</p>
            <p>We present a new formulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic bounds and symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a vast increase in research into van der Waals magnetic materials. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. Here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and providing a robust experimental demonstration that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism is attributable to orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights into the behavior of low-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</p>

            <p>We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far away from half-filling.</p>

            <p>Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, existing techniques have not achieved strain in 2D materials that is simultaneously high in magnitude (>1%), stable over long periods, and spatially programmable, meaning the strain level can be deterministically engineered across different regions of a single 2D layer. Here, we apply spatially programmable biaxial strain (e_b) up to 2.2% with spatial resolution of 0.13 %e_b um-1 in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique introduces a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Cayao, Masatoshi Sato</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <p>Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Lei Ma, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law</p>
            <p>The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</p>

            <p>We use a first-principles calculations approach to reveal the electronic and magnetic properties of chromium diiodide (CrI$_2$) bilayers and establish a hierarchy of magnetic interactions across stable registries. The monolayer presents a x-stripe antiferromagnetic ground state, while in bilayers the BA$^\prime$ stacking is the global minimum with antiparallel interlayer magnetic alignment. Bilayer configurations strengthen the exchange in the plane by 6 % to 10 %, while the exchange between layers is registry-dependent. The symmetry of each stacking configuration allows for anisotropic interactions. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms appear in structures without inversion symmetry, which in this case also generates in-plane polarizations of up to $\sim$ 10 $\mu$C/cm$^2$, resulting in direct magnetoelectric coupling that is absent in centrosymmetric monolayers. Thus, stacking acts both as a selector of exchange anisotropy and as a driver of magnetoelectricity. Our results show that bilayer CrI$_2$ can be mechanically reconfigured through interlayer sliding, with energy differences between stacking orders (25-50 meV/f.u.) that are compatible with experimental actuation. Tunable magnetism and register-dependent polarization offer promising opportunities for novel spintronic devices, where structural transitions can affect both magnetic states and electric dipoles.</p>

            <p>Active navigation in disordered media depends on a biased random walk interacting with environmental constraints. Using E. coli chemotactic navigation in agar gels as a model system, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between diffusive exploration and chemotactic directional bias that dictates the optimal strategy for population range expansion. Counter-intuitively, evolution selects for shorter mean run times ({\tau}_f) to achieve faster chemotactic migration in denser environments. Controlled experiments reveal a non-monotonic relationship between chemotactic navigation speed and {\tau}_f, with the optimum shifting according to the density of physical traps in the gel. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that escape from these traps occurs independently of the tumbling mechanism, challenging the classical view that reorientation is essential for navigation in obstructed spaces. Based on these insights, we develop a minimal theoretical model showing that the optimal {\tau}_f emerges from an antagonistic scaling: while the diffusion coefficient increases with {\tau}_f, the chemotactic bias coefficient decreases with it. This work establishes a general principle for optimizing active transport through complex, disordered environments.</p>

            <p>The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) allow for the probing of multiparticle excited-states in reciprocal space. While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a general theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics.</p>

Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability.

We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing, and the control techniques are broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</p>

            <p>Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems.</p>

            <h2>Deriving the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis from Eigenstate Typicality and Kinematic Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucheng Wang</p>
            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet a complete and conceptually transparent derivation has remained elusive. In this work, we derive the structure of ETH from a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP), together with general kinematic ingredients arising from entropy maximization, Hilbert-space geometry, and locality. ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable, with respect to local measurements, from states drawn from the Haar measure on a narrow microcanonical shell. Within this framework, diagonal ETH arises from concentration of measure, provided that eigenstate typicality holds. The structure of off-diagonal matrix elements is then fixed by entropic scaling and the finite-time dynamical correlations of local observables, with ETP serving as the dynamical bridge to energy eigenstates, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, Hilbert-space geometry, and chaos-induced eigenstate typicality, and clarify its regime of validity across generic quantum-chaotic many-body systems, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew P. Leighton, Christopher W. Lynn</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian stochastic processes are ubiquitous in biology. Nevertheless, we lack a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies. In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest.</p>

            <h2>Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanbit Oh, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</p>

            <p>Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</p>

            <h2>Comparing Hubbard parameters from linear-response theory and Hartree-Fock-based approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wooil Yang, Iurii Timrov, Francesco Aquilante, Young-Woo Son</p>
            <p>Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances in Flat Directions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcel Kühn, Bernd Rosenow</p>
            <p>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.</p>

            <h2>Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via cluster state measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Okuda, Aswin Parayil Mana, Hiroki Sukeno</p>
            <p>Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lluís Hernández-Navarro, Kenneth Distefano, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia</p>
            <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.</p>

            <h2>Reshaping the Quantum Arrow of Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Pedro García-Pintos, Yi-Kai Liu, Alexey V. Gorshkov</p>
            <p>While the microscopic laws of physics are often symmetric under time reversal, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. It can also be used to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system. Finally, we design a feedback-driven continuous measurement engine powered by the energy pumped into the system by the monitoring process. We show the engine can operate under experimentally realizable conditions with feedback delay and finite-efficiency measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu-Heng Shao, Jonathan Sorce, Manu Srivastava</p>
            <p>The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO$_2$) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO$_2$ interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in Hahn-echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin relaxation with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Data-driven molecular discovery leverages artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and generative modeling to filter and design novel molecules. Discovering novel molecules requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, but ML models struggle to generalize OOD. Currently, no systematic benchmarks exist for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present $\mathbf{BOOM}$, $\mathbf{b}$enchmarks for $\mathbf{o}$ut-$\mathbf{o}$f-distribution $\mathbf{m}$olecular property predictions: a chemically-informed benchmark for OOD performance on common molecular property prediction tasks. We evaluate over 150 model-task combinations to benchmark deep learning models on OOD performance. Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance. Developing models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML. This open-source benchmark is available at this https URL</p>

            <p>We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios.

            <p>The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</p>

            <p>Superfluorescence (SF) is the collective emission of intense, coherent light from an interacting ensemble of quantum emitters1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-8, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized SF from chiral materials (chiral SF) has not been realized9,10. Here, we report the first observation of chiral SF originating from edge states in large-area (>100 um * 100 um) vertically aligned chiral perovskite superlattices at room-temperature. Theoretical quantum optics calculations describe the transition from initially unpolarized, incoherent spontaneous emission to a coherent chiral SF state, quantitatively reproducing both the experimentally observed generation of circular polarization (up to ~14%) and its reversal in sign with opposite material handedness. Moreover, we show that both the intensity and the degree of circular polarization of chiral SF can be modulated by a weak magnetic field, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between chirality and many-body quantum coherence, thereby revealing promising new directions for chirality-controlled quantum-optical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrigyan Brahmachari, Austin Hulse, Henry D. Pfister, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</p>

            <p>We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 min. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</p>

While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha < \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</p>

            <p>We show that any Petz $f$-divergence (where $f$ is operator convex) between quantum states admits a universal $\chi^2$-mixture representation: the distinguishability of $\rho$ from $\sigma$ is obtained as a positive superposition of quadratic contrasts $\chi^2_\lambda$, with nonnegative weights $w_f(\lambda)$ determined explicitly from the Stieltjes representation of the generator $f$. This identifies $\chi^2_\lambda$ as atomic building blocks for quantum $f$-divergences and yields closed-form $w_f$ for canonical choices (relative entropy/KL, Hellinger/Bures, R'{e}nyi). By mapping $\chi^2_\lambda$ into a classical Pearson $\chi^2$, we leverage the Chapman-Robbins variational representation and obtain a tight and universal quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation: any $f$-divergence is lower bounded by a function of the statistics of quantum observables (mean and variance), reproducing previous and novel results in quantum thermodynamics as applications.</p>

By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</p>

Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamalesh Bera, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moiré materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism (AM) has brought renewed attention to the Lieb lattice. Here, we broaden the scope of altermagnetic models on the Lieb lattice by using a general scheme based on spin clusters. We design various altermagnetic models with d- and g-wave on the Lieb lattice, and investigate its interplay with spin-orbit coupling. While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Our results highlight the exotic properties of AM, and suggest its potential applications in engineering topological quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Multipoles as quantitative order parameters for altermagnetic spin splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Martinelli, Anouk Droux, Claude Ederer</p>
            <p>We establish a quantitative relation between the altermagnetic spin-splitting and different higher order multipoles of the charge and magnetization density around the magnetic atoms. Magnetic multipoles such as octupoles or triakontadipoles have been suggested as potential ferroic order parameters for d- and g-wave altermagnetism, respectively, based mainly on qualitative symmetry arguments. We use first-principles-based electronic structure calculations to establish a clear quantitative relation between the strength of the altermagnetic spin splitting and the magnitude of certain local multipoles. We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands.</p>

            <h2>Fractionalized topological d+id superconductivity in the Yao-Lee-Kondo model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengzhi Tang, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>A conclusive experimental realization of 2D chiral topological superconductivity remains elusive. Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*).</p>

            <p>Dissipative coupling refers to the effect where two systems interact with each other mediated by dissipation channels. Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states.</p>

            <p>By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon thermal Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the planar magnon thermal Hall effect without the DM interaction. This removes the local inversion-symmetry-breaking condition for generating the magnon thermal Hall effect. Moreover, we predict an exotic phenomenon that the thermal conductivity exhibits angular dependence with respect to the in-plane magnetization. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</p>

In particular, acoustic phonons can be interpreted as Goldstone modes that emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum, and we find that removing the nontrivial quantum geometric contribution from the dynamical matrix causes the acoustic phonon modes to behave in a non-analytic fashion.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous tendency of superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves (CDWs) has reignited interest in the nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their phase diagrams. While pronounced dispersion anomalies were reported in several phonon branches, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under low temperature and high magnetic field, we uncover a striking phonon renormalization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting the wave vectors of a short-range 2D-CDW, emerging above the superconducting transition, and a long-range 3D-CDW, appearing only when superconductivity is strongly suppressed. The spectral changes are strongest around the wave vector of the 3D-CDW despite the fact that it is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models, instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive CDW excitations and provide insights into the interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

            <p>We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</p>

            <p>The spectrum of Markov generators encodes physical information beyond simple decay and oscillation, which reflects irreversibility and governs the structure of correlation functions. In this work, we prove an ellipse theorem that provides a universal thermodynamic geometric constraint on the spectrum of Markov rate matrices. The theorem states that all eigenvalues lie within a specific ellipse in the complex plane. In particular, the imaginary parts of the spectrum, which indicate oscillatory modes, are bounded by the maximum thermodynamic force associated with individual transitions. This spectral bound further constrains the initial short-time behavior of correlation functions between two arbitrary observables. Finally, we compare our result with a previously proposed conjecture, which remains an open problem and warrants further investigation.</p>

            <h2>Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. V. Solovyev</p>
            <p>The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism. Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such unconventional antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within the unit cell containing only one magnetic site. We show that such presentation is possible due to special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry constrains the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t} \}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic site per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and net orbital magnetization, and provide transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between AFM sublattices, as well as the orthorhombic strain, controlling the piezomagnetic response. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples including two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the rutile structure, using for these purposes realistic models derived from first-principles calculations.</p>

            <p>We develop an experimental double-model analysis, combined with density-functional theory (DFT), to investigate the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) associated with the electron-capture (EC) decay ``aftereffects'' (ECAE) phenomenon. This electronic phenomenon, which is reversible with temperature, is typically observed in TDPAC experiments on oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC) $\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd probe atoms and was recently explained within an \emph{ab initio} framework based on fluctuations in the number of trapped electron holes at ^{111}$Cd [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{105}$, 195201 (2022)]. From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of \emph{initial} electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by Bäverstam \emph{et al.} (BO approach) and Lupascu \emph{et al.} (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for ^{111}$In-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC.</p>

            <p>Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality.</p>

            <p>The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</p>

            <p>The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the GW +Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the light-matter interaction via the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects, including a dependence of the photoemission angular distribution on the pump pulse polarization. Moreover, our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is an extension of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon.</p>

            <p>Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.</p>

In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms from the Si(6c) site. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal Magnetoresistances in Chiral Tellurium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuchen Li, Chang Niu, Peide D. Ye, Axel Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties.</p>

            <h2>Reinterpreting Landauer conductance, solving the quantum measurement problem, grand unification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanchan Meena, Souvik Ghosh, P. Singha Deo</p>
            <p>In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intermediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be inferred through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentially the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dilate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguments for the general case.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jijie Zou, Zhanghao Zhouyin, Qiangqiang Gu, Shishir Kumar Pandey</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.</p>

            <h2>Finite-temperature quantum rotor approach for ultracold bosons in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Rodríguez Martín, T. A. Zaleski</p>
            <p>Interacting bosons in optical lattices directly expose quantum phases in a clean, highly controllable environment. This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures.</p>

            <p>FeSe stands out among iron-based superconductors due to its extended nematic phase without the onset of long-range magnetic order. While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase. These findings indicate that a multiband framework can robustly describe the magneto-elasto-transport properties in FeSe and arguably in other iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p>Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works.

We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</p>

            <p>We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waltraut Wustmann, Kevin D. Osborn</p>
            <p>The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the Navier-Stokes equation in the presence of thermal noise, both at finite viscosity (revisiting the seminal work by Forster-Nelson-Stephen) and in the inviscid limit, which has not yet been explored. We determine the space-time velocity correlations in this dynamics, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. While spectrally truncated three-dimensional Euler flows reach a stationary equilibrium state, they exhibit non-trivial temporal correlations. We show that these non-trivial correlations persist for small but finite viscosity, yielding an emergent $\tau\sim k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We characterise the crossover from the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$, expected at large viscosity, to the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ found in the inviscid limit.</p>

            <h2>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hrvoje Vrcan, Johan H. Mentink</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ansätze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Yoshimura, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiran Babasaheb Estake, T. R. Vishnu, Dibyendu Roy</p>
            <p>We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the Möbius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the Möbius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the Möbius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.</p>

            <p>We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to quantum circuits and Brownian models, and is simple at the single-site level, in contrast to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev chains. It is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</p>

            <p>Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations of fermions has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</p>

            <p>Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</p>

            <p>Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kashif Ammar Yasir, Gao Xianlong</p>
            <p>Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the amorphous ice layer during premelting using AFM integrating machine learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binze Tang, Chon-Hei Lo, Tiancheng Liang, Jiani Hong, Mian Qin, Yizhi Song, Duanyun Cao, Ying Jiang, Limei Xu</p>
            <p>Premelting plays a key role across physics, chemistry, materials and biology sciences but remains poorly understood at the atomic level due to surface characterization limitations. We report the discovery of a novel amorphous ice layer (AIL) preceding the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) during ice premelting, enabled by a machine learning framework integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics simulations. This approach overcomes AFM's depth and signal limitations, allowing for three-dimensional surface structure reconstruction from AFM images. It further enables structural exploration of premelting interfaces across a wide temperature range that are experimentally inaccessible. We identify the AIL, present between 121-180K, displaying disordered two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network with solid-like dynamics. Our findings refine the ice premelting phase diagram and offering new insights into the surface growth dynamic, dissolution and interfacial chemical reactivity. Methodologically, this work establishes a novel framework for AFM-based 3D structural discovery, marking a significant leap in our ability to probe complex disordered interfaces with unprecedented precision and paving the way for future disciplinary research, including surface reconstruction, crystallization, ion solvation, and biomolecular recognition.</p>

            <h2>Localization from Infinitesimal Kinetic Grading: Critical Scaling and Kibble-Zurek Universality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Argha Debnath, Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional lattice model with site-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes that follow a power-law profile. The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $\alpha$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|\alpha| \to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles.</p>

            <h2>Time-resolved Charge Detection in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Niese, Michele Masseroni, Clara Scherm, Christoph Adam, Max J. Ruckriegel, Artem O. Denisov, Jonas D. Gerber, Lara Ostertag, Jessica Richter, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin</p>
            <p>We investigate electronic transport through gate-defined quantum dots in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ using an integrated charge detector. We observe a crossover from two weakly coupled single dots to a strongly coupled double quantum dot. In the regime of extremely weak dot-lead coupling, where the direct transport current is below the detection limit, we measure the dot occupation via charge detection and access the few-electron regime. Due to the large band gap of MoS$_2$, tunneling rates can be sufficiently suppressed to resolve individual tunneling events. These results establish a platform for single-shot spin- and valley-to-charge conversion and highlight the potential of transition-metal dichalcogenide quantum dots for quantum information applications.</p>

            <h2>Quadrupolar and dipolar phases of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide trilayer heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Zimmerman, Daniel Podolsky, Ronen Rapaport, Snir Gazit</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.</p>

            <h2>Anyon Dispersion in Aharonov-Casher Bands and Implications for Twisted MoTe${}_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Yan, Qingchen Li, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Classifying one-dimensional Floquet phases through two-dimensional topological order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Campbell McLauchlan, Vedant Motamarri, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>Floquet systems display rich phenomena, such as time crystals, with many-body localisation (MBL) protecting the phases from heating. While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Anyon Statistics from Neural Network Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andres Perez Fadon, David Pfau, James S. Spencer, Wan Tong Lou, Titus Neupert, W. M. C. Foulkes</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states host emergent anyons with exotic exchange statistics, but obtaining direct access to their topological properties in real systems remains a challenge. Neural-network wavefunctions provide a flexible computational approach, as they can represent highly correlated states without requiring a tailored basis. Here we use the neural-network variational Monte Carlo method to study the fractional quantum Hall effect on the torus and find the three degenerate ground states at filling factor nu=1/3. From these, we extract the modular S matrix via entanglement interferometry, a technique previously only applied to lattice models. The resulting S matrix encodes the quantum dimensions, fusion rules, and exchange statistics of the emergent anyons, providing a direct numerical demonstration of the topological order. The calculated anyon properties match the well-known theoretical and experimental results. Our work establishes neural-network wavefunctions as a powerful new tool for investigating anyonic properties.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory for edge current and noise in 2D topological superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Pintus, A. Crépieux</p>
            <p>We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.</p>

            <h2>Recent progress in quantum spin liquids, fractional magnetization plateaus, and unconventional superconductivity in kagome lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Wei He, Shun-Li Yu, Jian-Xin Li</p>
            <p>The kagome lattice, with its unique geometric structure, has emerged as a leading platform for exploring quantum many-body physics, particularly in the study of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) and unconventional superconductivity. This review highlights recent advancements in the investigations of QSLs, fractional magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets, and unconventional superconductivity in vanadium-based kagome superconductors. We begin by examining the classical ground-state properties of the nearest-neighbor kagome antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and introducing recent experimental progress in the study of QSLs and fractional magnetization plateau phases. Next, we discuss the fermionic description of the QSL states, along with related gauge theory and the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. We then focus on discussing the VMC studies of QSLs and magnetization plateau phases in kagome antiferromagnets. For superconductivity in kagome systems, we first analyze the characteristics of the electronic structure and the possible associated electronic instabilities. Finally, we review recent experimental advances in unconventional superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), with a particular focus on chiral superconductivity and pairing density waves.</p>

            <h2>Power-Law Suppression of Phonon Thermal Transport by Magnetic Excitations in a Molecular Quantum Spin Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Fujiyama, K. Ueda, Y. Otsuka</p>
            <p>We present large-scale ab initio phonon calculations for the molecular quantum spin liquid X[Pd(dmit)2]2. An unusually low average phonon velocity ( 700 {m/s}) and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1} confine the Debye T^{3} regime to T < 2 K. As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Holistic Design of Catalysts Tailored for Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Qian, Yue Li, Ying Xie, Jian Zhang, Pai Li, Yue Yu, Zhe Liu, Feng Ding, Jin Zhang</p>
            <p>Catalyst design is crucial for materials synthesis, especially for complex reaction networks. Strategies like collaborative catalytic systems and multifunctional catalysts are effective but face challenges at the nanoscale. Carbon nanotube synthesis contains complicated nanoscale catalytic reactions, thus achieving high-density, high-quality semiconducting CNTs demands innovative catalyst design. In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Strain Modulated Correlated Plasmons in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and Their Role in High-temperature Superconductivity</h2>

            <p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern insulator with higher Chern number in optical lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Xing Ding, Wen-Tong Li, Li-Min Zhang, Yu-Biao Wu, Duanlu Zhou, Lin Zhuang, Wu-Ming Liu</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases</p>
