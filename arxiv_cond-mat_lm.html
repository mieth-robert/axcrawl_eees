            <h2>On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert M. Varonov, Todor M. Mishonov</p>
            <p>Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of Séamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. Röhler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeet Shah, Laura Shou, Jeremy Shuler, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</p>

            <h2>Probing the pseudogap and beyond: examining single-particle properties of the hole- and electron-doped Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen O. Wang, Edwin W. Huang, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux</p>
            <p>We compute high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the Hubbard model using the unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, revealing an asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</p>

            <h2>Mean-field theory of the electromagnon resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel A. Andreev, Mariya Iv. Trukhanova</p>
            <p>We present the analytical theory of the electromagnon resonance for the multiferroics of spin origin. We consider the spin density evolution under the influence of magnetoelectric coupling in the presence of the electromagnetic wave. The dielectric permeability is found for the eigen-wave perturbations accompanied by perturbations of the electric field. The imaginary part of the dielectric permeability is found as the function of the applied electric field frequency, while the frequency of the eigen-waves is found from the dispersion equation as the function of the wave vector and parameters of the system. The result shows the existence of two peaks. One sharp peak is associated with the magnon resonance, while the second wide peak at the approximately four times smaller frequency is interpreted as the electromagnon resonance in accordance with existing experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Sisyphus driving in a matter-wave swing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen L. Liu, Jun Jian, Ning X. Zheng, Hui Tang, Ji Z. Wu, Yu Q. Li, Wen X. Zhang, Jie Ma, Suo T. Jia</p>
            <p>Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are an exceptionally versatile testbed for the investigation of physics phenomenon especially the well-known classical system. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of sodium atoms confined in an optical dipole trap to simulate the matter-wave on the swing. Under the driving of Anti-Sisyphus process, the swing was excited successfully. Moreover, the spin echo like behavior and collective-mode excitation appear during the oscillation of matter-wave swing, manifesting the quantum nature of the system beyond its classical counterpart. Our work lays the foundation for matter-wave on the swing and more generally points to a future of practical applications for the motional quantum states linked with quantum information science.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast dynamics of three-dimensional Kane plasmons in the narrow-bandgap Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyue Zhou, Yi Chan, Siyuan Zhu, Fu Deng, Wei Bai, Jingdi Zhang</p>
            <p>We report on an ultrafast terahertz spectroscopic study on the dynamics of free carriers and the pertinent bulk plasmons in Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te (MCT) film, a narrowband semiconductor accommodating three dimensional massless Kane fermions. The ultrabroadband terahertz source enables the investigation of the lightly doped equilibrium state in the presence of plasmon-phonon hybridization through the heavily doped excited state, primarily dominated by plasmons. Without the recourse to the resource consuming cryogenic high magnetic field spectroscopy that hinges on observable related to the interband transition, we show that the massless band dispersion can instead be conveniently perceived by the room temperature study of the intraband transition through the determination of the plasmon carrier density relationship. We found the plasma frequency in MCT scales with the cube root of carrier density, in contrast with the square root scaling in the conventional massive fermion system of parabolic band dispersion. This work also answers the curious question of whether the MCT can maintain its massless Kane fermion character in case the strict gapless condition is deviated from. The method presented herein provides a convenient approach to identifying the landscape of both massless and massive band dispersion.</p>

            <h2>Shift current in 2D Janus Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: the role of excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuncheng Mao, Ju Zhou, Myrta Grüning, Claudio Attaccalite</p>
            <p>We study the shift current in two two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum diselenide (MoSSe) and tungsten diselenide (WSSe). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, in which the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This approach incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence of C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is shifted thus giving rise to a significant photocurrent. These results highlight the role played by excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate that these materials are promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting critical temperature and dimensionality tuning of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ via biaxial strain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsz Fung Poon, King Yau Yip, Ying Kit Tsui, Lingfei Wang, Kai Ham Yu, Wei Zhang, Zheyu Wang, Taketo Nakatani, Chishiro Michioka, Hiroaki Ueda, Siu Tung Lam, Kwing To Lai, Swee K. Goh</p>
            <p>Kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) has emerged as an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and other quantum states. Among the three compounds, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a notably lower superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) at ambient pressure, posing challenges in exploring the superconducting state. For instance, the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) is small and thus difficult to measure accurately against other control parameters. Hence, enhancing superconductivity would facilitate $H_{c2}$ measurements, providing insights into key superconducting properties such as the dimensionality. In this letter, we report the tuning of the $T_c$ in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the application of biaxial strain. Utilizing a negative thermal expansion material ZrW$_2$O$_8$ as a substrate, we achieve a substantial biaxial strain of $\epsilon=1.50\%$, resulting in a remarkable 75\% enhancement in $T_c$. We investigate the $H_{c2}$ as a function of temperature, revealing a transition from multi-band to single-band superconductivity with increasing tensile strain. Additionally, we study the $H_{c2}$ as a function of field angle, revealing a plausible correlation between the $T_c$ enhancement and the change in dimensionality of the superconductivity under tensile strain. Further analysis quantitatively illustrates a transition towards two-dimensional superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when subjected to tensile strain. Our work demonstrates that the application of biaxial strain allows for the tuning of both the $T_c$ and superconducting dimensionality in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

            <h2>Full-Gap Superconductivity in BaAs/Ferropnictide Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Qiang Ren, Qiang-Jun Cheng, Hui-Hui He, Ze-Xian Deng, Fang-Jun Cheng, Yong-Wei Wang, Cong-Cong Lou, Qinghua Zhang, Lin Gu, Kai Liu, Xu-Cun Ma, Qi-Kun Xue, Can-Li Song</p>
            <p>Interfacial interactions often promote the emergence of unusual phenomena in two-dimensional systems, including high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of full-gap superconductivity with a maximal spectroscopic temperature up to 26 K in a BaAs monolayer grown on ferropnictide Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (abbreviated as BFCA) epitaxial films. The superconducting gap remains robust even when the thickness of underlying BFCA is reduced to the monolayer limit, in contrast to the rapid suppression of $T_\textrm{c}$ in standalone BFCA thin films. We reveal that the exceptional crystallinity of the BaAs/BFCA heterostructures, featured by their remarkable electronic and geometric uniformities, is crucial for the emergent full-gap superconductivity with mean-field temperature dependence and pronounced bound states within magnetic vortices. Our findings open up new avenues to unravel the mysteries of unconventional superconductivity in ferropnictides and advance the development of FeAs-based heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Universally enhanced superconductivity and coexisting ferroelectricity at oxide interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Zhang, Ming Qin, Yanqiu Sun, Siyuan Hong, Yanwu Xie</p>
            <p>The coexistence of superconductivity and ferroelectricity is rare due to their conflicting requirements: superconductivity relies on free charge carriers, whereas ferroelectricity typically occurs in insulating systems. At LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces, we demonstrate the coexistence of two-dimensional superconductivity and ferroelectricity, enabled by the unique properties of KTaO3 as a quantum paraelectric. Systematic gating and poling experiments reveal a universal enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) by 0.2-0.6 K and bistable transport properties, including hysteresis, strongly suggesting the existence of switchable ferroelectric polarization in the interfacial conducting layer. Hysteresis loops indicate robust ferroelectricity below 50 K. The Tc enhancement is attributed to ferroelectric polarization-induced reduction in dielectric constant, which narrows the interfacial potential well, confining carriers closer to the interface. The bistability arises from switchable ferroelectric polarization, which modulates the potential well depending on polarization direction. These findings establish a straightforward mechanism coupling ferroelectricity and superconductivity, providing a promising platform for exploring their interplay.</p>

            <h2>Endoreversible Stirling cycles: plasma engines at maximal power</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Behrendt, Sebastian Deffner</p>
            <p>Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics. We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles, for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dynamical signatures of non-Hermitian boundary modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Maria Zelenayova, Paolo Molignini, Emil J. Bergholtz</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</p>

            <p>Honoring the hundredth anniversary of the birthday of Ihor R. Yuknovskii we analyze new developments in the statistical thermodynamics of Coulomb systems. The basic idea of this work is to demonstrate that the exponential potential used in the first papers of Yukhnovskii is an appropriate reference system for a description of classical and quantum charged particle systems. We briefly discuss the collaboration between the groups of Ihor R. Yuknovskii in Lviv and Günter Kelbg in Rostock and analyze several approaches based on pair correlation functions and cluster expansion in the classical as well as in the quantum case. Finally, we discuss the progress in the statistical description of bound states of three particles as in helium plasmas and in MgCl$_2$-solutions in the classical case and present new results regarding the influence of three-particle bound states. In particular, we give new expressions for the cluster integrals and the mass action functions of helium atoms and ionic triple associates as well as for the equation of state (EoS).</p>

            <h2>Preferred Synthesis of Armchair SnS2 Nanotubes</h2>

            <p>In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.</p>

            <h2>The many faces of rotating quantum turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Amette Estrada, Marc E. Brachet, Pablo D. Mininni</p>
            <p>Quantum turbulence shares many similarities with classical turbulence in the isotropic and homogeneous case, despite the inviscid and quantized nature of its vortices. However, when quantum fluids are subjected to rotation, their turbulent dynamics depart significantly from the classical expectations. We explore the phenomenology of rotating quantum turbulence, emphasizing how rotation introduces new regimes with no classical analogs. We review recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical developments, and present new numerical results that map out distinct dynamical regimes arising from the interplay of rotation, quantization, non-linearities, and condensed matter regimes. In particular, we show the importance of distinguishing the dynamics of rotating quantum fluids in the slowly rotating, rapidly rotating, and low Landau level regimes. The findings have implications for the dynamics of liquid helium, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and neutron stars, and show how rotating quantum fluids can serve as a unique platform bridging turbulence theory and condensed matter physics revealing novel states of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giniyat Khaliullin, Jiří Chaloupka</p>
            <p>We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.</p>

Such a level structure is supported by square-planar coordination of nickel ions or a suitable substitution of apical oxygens. We construct the corresponding singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Yong Song, Gábor B. Halász, Jiaqiang Yan, Benjamin J. Lawrie, Petro Maksymovych</p>
            <p>We investigate the orbitally resolved superconducting properties of bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the spectral weights of both the large $\Delta_1$ and small $\Delta_2$ superconducting gaps remain nearly unchanged at the top Se sites as the STM tip approaches atomic contact. In contrast, the spectral weight of $\Delta_2$ increases significantly at the Fe and bottom Se sites. These results suggest that the gap $\Delta_2$ is localized in the xy-plane and likely associated with the dxy orbital band. Furthermore, we observe a long-range suppression of the large gap $\Delta_1$ near one-dimensional (1D) defects such as twin boundaries, wrinkles, and step edges, whereas $\Delta_2$ remains robust. This indicates that the two superconducting gaps respond differently to such 1D defects. High-resolution measurement using a Pb-coated tip reveals localized in-gap states near 1D defects, indicating possible defect-induced magnetism. Our findings highlight the contrasting behaviors of gap $\Delta_1$ and gap $\Delta_2$ in response to local electronic and magnetic environments and provide real-space evidence for orbital-selective superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of the excluded volume of surfactant ligands on the shape of incipient quantum dots (QDs) to which they are attached. We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.</p>

The approach is based on a modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed atoms - quasiparticles are obtained.

Here we showcase on a stochastically forced version of the celebrated Lorenz '63 model the feasibility and skill of such an approach by considering different Koopman dictionaries, which allows us to treat also seamlessly coarse-graining approaches like the Ulam method. Our findings provide support for the development of response theory-based investigation methods also in an equation-agnostic, data-driven environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixin Zhang, Cristian Batista, Yang Zhang</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</p>

            <h2>Compressibility measurement of the thermal MI--BG transition in an optical lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phil Russ, Mi Yan, Nicholas Kowalski, Laura Wadleigh, Vito W. Scarola, Brian DeMarco</p>
            <p>Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</p>

            <h2>Jamming as a topological satisfiability transition with contact number hyperuniformity and criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Shang, Yinqiao Wang, Deng Pan, Yuliang Jin, Jie Zhang</p>
            <p>The jamming transition between flow and amorphous-solid states exhibits paradoxical properties characterized by hyperuniformity (suppressed spatial fluctuations) and criticality (hyperfluctuations), whose origin remains unclear. Here we model the jamming transition by a topological satisfiability transition in a minimum network model with simultaneously hyperuniform distributions of contacts, diverging length scales and scale-free clusters. We show that these phenomena stem from isostaticity and mechanical stability: the former imposes a global equality, and the latter local inequalities on arbitrary sub-systems. This dual constraint bounds contact number fluctuations from both above and below, limiting them to scale with the surface area. The hyperuniform and critical exponents of the network model align with those of frictionless jamming, suggesting a new universality class of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Our results provide a minimal, dynamics-independent framework for jamming criticality and hyperuniformity in disordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic elastomers: A complete phase-field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhad Kamarei, Evan Breedlove, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</p>
            <p>This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and iii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</p>

            <h2>Lattice-dependent orientational order in active crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Till Welker, Ricard Alert</p>
            <p>Via mechanisms not accessible at equilibrium, self-propelled particles can form phases with positional order, such as crystals, and with orientational order, such as polar flocks. However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice.</p>

Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in a Chern band: effect of time-reversal-symmetry breaking on superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernhard E. Lüscher, Mark H. Fischer</p>
            <p>Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p>

            <p>We report the creation of an ultracold gas of bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules. We first demonstrate a cooling strategy relying on sympathetic cooling of $^{133}$Cs to produce an ultracold mixture. From this mixture, weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about 130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.</p>

            <p>We show that for a standard continuously-polydisperse model with particle-diameter distribution $P(\sigma) \propto \sigma^{-3}$ and polydispersity index $\Delta$, employing a combination of standard SWAP moves and transient degree of freedom (TDOF) moves during a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like particle-growth process dramatically increases the generated packings' jamming densities $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\Delta)$, for a wide range of $\Delta$. We find that the fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing crystallization or fractionation. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 96% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 154%.</p>

            <h2>Thin active nematohydrodynamic layers: asymptotic theories and instabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehrana R. Nejad</p>
            <p>Starting from a three-dimensional description of an active nematic layer, we employ an asymptotic theory to derive a series of low-dimensional continuum models that capture the coupled dynamics of flat and curved films, including variations in film thickness, shape deformations, internal velocity fields, and the dynamics of orientational order. Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.</p>

Our update amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase, unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model: Insights from entanglement entropy and role of short-range spatial correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankur Majumder, Sudeshna Sen</p>
            <p>The Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition is a paradigmatic phenomenon where Coulomb interactions between electrons drive a metal-insulator phase transition. It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.</p>

            <p>Modulating liquid-to-solid transitions and the resulting crystalline structure for tailored properties is much desired. Colloidal systems are exemplary to this end, but the fundamental knowledge gaps in relating the influence of intermolecular interactions to crystallization behavior continue to hinder progress. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by studying nucleation and growth in systems with modified Lennard-Jones potential. Specifically, we study the commonly used 12-6 potential and a softer 7-6 potential. The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both systems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under these conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is comparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal structures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur predominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the critical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways. One pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement. Our study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through modifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation kinetics. The results have significant implications in designing approaches for polymorph selection and modulating self-assembly mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and non-volatile memory with great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge devices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical properties, such as the effective anisotropy field ($H_{\rm{k,eff}}$, related to magnetic stability) and damping ($\alpha$ key factor in device energy efficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for designing and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced metrology techniques, Time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) stands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing traditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). However, the full potential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully pledged due to the lack of systematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we address this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for optimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our work identifies the optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal amplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to $H_{\rm{k,eff}}$ and $\alpha$. By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting sensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract magnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization framework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics, paving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine the landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.</p>

            <p>CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ has the paradox that low temperature static magnetic order is incompatible with the crystal structure owing to a mirror plane that exactly frustrates magnetic interactions. Despite no observable structural distortion with diffraction, CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ does magnetically order below $T_{\rm N}$ $\sim$ 25 K with the breaking of spin ground state degeneracy proposed to be a realization of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in analogy to the celebrated orbital Jahn-Teller transition. We apply neutron and Raman spectroscopy to study the dynamics of this transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$. We find anomalous acoustics associated with a symmetry breaking strain that characterizes the spin Jahn-Teller transition. Crucially, the energy of this phonon coincides with the energy scale of the magnetic excitations, and has the same symmetry of an optic mode, observed with Raman spectroscopy, which atypically softens in energy with decreasing temperature. Taken together, we propose that the energetics of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ are related to cooperative magnetoelastic fluctuations as opposed to conventional soft critical dynamics which typically drive large measurable static displacements.</p>

            <p>The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>Here we present an experimentally practical and robust method to compute the transient extensional viscosity from exponential shear on a wide variety of viscoelastic complex fluids. To achieve this, we derive an analytical, frame-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function, valid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original framework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect of rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern strain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain rates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and up to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to observe finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the kinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations of the method, establishing firm windows of data validity. The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids. We show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of producing "strong flow" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with coil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in extensional flows (Wi > 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach finite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then quantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional extensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using the same PIB solution. Questions related to generality of this approach are addressed, including discussions on multi-mode relaxation and shear thinning.</p>

Unlike SiO$_2$/Si/SiO$_2$, AlN/GaN/AlN can be grown fully epitaxially, enabling high carrier mobilities suitable for high-frequency applications. However, developing these heterostructures and related devices has been hindered by challenges in strain management, polarization effects, defect control and charge trapping. Here, the AlN single-crystal high electron mobility transistor (XHEMT) is introduced, a new nitride transistor technology designed to address these issues. The XHEMT structure features a pseudomorphic GaN channel sandwiched between AlN layers, grown on single-crystal AlN substrates. First-generation XHEMTs demonstrate RF performance on par with the state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs, achieving 5.92 W/mm output power and 65% peak power-added efficiency at 10 GHz under 17 V drain bias. These devices overcome several limitations present in conventional GaN HEMTs, which are grown on lattice-mismatched foreign substrates that introduce undesirable dislocations and exacerbated thermal resistance. With the recent availability of 100-mm AlN substrates and AlN's high thermal conductivity (340 W/m$\cdot$K), XHEMTs show strong potential for next-generation RF electronics.</p>

            <p>Chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides, including complex chalcogenides and transition metal dichalcogenides, are emerging semiconductors with direct or indirect band gaps within the visible spectrum. These materials are being explored for various photonic and electronic applications, such as photodetectors, photovoltaics, and phase-change electronics. Understanding the fundamental properties of these materials is crucial for optimizing their functionalities. Therefore, the availability of large, high-quality single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides is essential for a better comprehension of their structure and properties. In this study, we present a novel crystal growth method that utilizes the exchange reaction between BaS and ZrCl$_4$/ HfCl$_4$. By carefully controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the binary sulfide to the chloride, we can grow single crystals of several materials, such as ZrS$_2$, HfS$_2$, BaZrS$_3$, and ZrOS. This method results in large single crystals with a short reaction time of 24 to 48 hours. High-resolution thin film diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirm the quality of the crystals produced through this exchange reaction. We also report the optical properties of these materials investigated using photoluminescence and Raman measurements. The chloride exchange reaction method paves the way for the synthesis of single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenide systems with a short reaction time but with low mosaicity and can be an alternative growth technique for single crystals of materials that are difficult to synthesize using conventional growth techniques.</p>

            <p>We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>Quantum droplets formed by rubidium, lithium, and sodium atoms have been analyzed in this paper by using a logarithmic-type Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Variational methods and numerical techniques were employed to solve the corresponding nonlinear equations. A disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate was analyzed to assess its radial evolution. Additionally, free expansion under rotation of the BEC was studied. Compression and expansion around the equilibrium radius were observed in different scenarios, predicting self-confinement, which implies the formation of quantum droplets originating from a BEC state. Briefly, the physical aspects of the system and the possible formation of Bose-nova effects are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-breaking motility of an active hinge in a crowded channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Garibaldi Rigon, Yongjoo Baek</p>
            <p>A recent experiment [Son et al., Soft Matter, 2024, 20,2777-2788] showed that self-propelled particles confined within a circular boundary filled with granular medium spontaneously form a motile cluster that stays on the boundary. This cluster exhibits persistent (counter)clockwise motion driven by symmetry breaking, which arises from a positive feedback between the asymmetry of the cluster and those of the surrounding granular medium. To investigate this symmetry-breaking mechanism in broader contexts, we propose and analyze the dynamics of an active hinge moving through a crowded two-dimensional channel. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the lifetime of the hinge's motile state varies nonmonotonically with both the packing fraction of the granular medium and the strength of self-propulsion. Furthermore, we observe an abrupt transition in the configuration of passive particles that sustain hinge motility as the hinge's maximum angle relative to the channel wall increases. These findings point to the possibility of designing superstructures composed of passive granular media doped with a small number of active elements, whose dynamics modes can be switched by tuning the properties of their components.</p>

            <h2>A Kaleidoscope of Topological Structures in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates with Weyl-Like Spin-Orbit Coupling in Anharmonic Trap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Liu, Zu-Jian Ying</p>
            <p>Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Cyclic Tensile Properties of Fluids with Composite Harmonic Exponential Waveforms (CHEW)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.A. Kroo, R.A. Nicholson, M.W Boehm, S.K. Baier, P.A. Underhill, G.H. McKinley</p>
            <p>Building off recent advances on how to practically use exponential shear in a torsional rheometer to compute transient planar extensional viscosity (Kroo et al. 2025a), we extend the technique to cyclic tensile measurements in complex fluids and soft solids. An novel input strain waveform provides a unifying approach that smoothly interpolates between exponential shear (ES) and oscillatory shear (SAOS/MAOS/LAOS) as a flow type parameter is varied. Analogous to cyclic tensile fatigue tests in solids, or the process of chewing in the oral cavity, this complex strain history is used to quantify the evolution of extensional material properties at large strains over sequential cycles of stretch. In the limit of large Hencky strain rates, the waveform locally increases exponentially and generates a period of strong material stretching. This allows for the direct computation of a transient planar extensional viscosity within specific domains of the periodic function. We demonstrate this technique on a set of model fluids, and then apply it to complex multiphase materials that mutate. These latter fluids exhibit progressive evolution in their rheological properties over repeated cycles of extensional deformation. Here we focus on two examples: a delicate foodstuff material (melted provolone cheese) which systematically decreases its extensional response over successive stretching cycles, mutating at a rate that is directly dependent on the effective Hencky strain rate. We contrast this with a PVA-borax solution which exhibits precisely the opposite effect during successive stretching cycles: increasing its planar extensional response over successive cycles, as interchain associative interactions (controlled via stretching) build structure within the fluid. These results highlight a promising new approach to study bulk extensional properties during cyclical stretching of complex fluids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Yang, Wanxiang Feng, Siyuan Liu, Shan Guan, Liwei Wen, Wei Jiang, Gui-Bin Liu, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>In this work, we reveal giant magneto-optical responses in two-dimensional(2D) antiferromagnets with nearly flat electronic bands, based on first-principles calculations and group-theoretical analysis. We identify a record-large second-order magneto-optical Schafer-Hubert(SH) effect, featuring a polarization rotation angle of 28 degree, in monolayer antiferromagnetic RuOCl2, driven by flatband-enhanced interband optical transitions. Both the valence and conduction bands exhibit pronounced directional flatness, giving rise to highly anisotropic optical absorption and broadband hyperbolic frequency windows spanning the entire visible spectrum. This anisotropy leads to an exceptionally strong linear dichroism (LD) reaching 50%, far exceeding values reported in other 2D magnetic systems. Remarkably, the giant SH effect and LD appear at distinct photon energies, reflecting a momentum-direction-dependent crossover between flat and dispersive bands. Both responses are further amplified with increasing RuOCl2 film thickness. Our results establish flat-band antiferromagnets as a fertile platform for realizing giant nonlinear magneto-optical effects and open new avenues for 2D opto-spintronic device applications.</p>

            <p>For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well, such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, a Schottky-gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky-gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. Here, we used a ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway to improve performance in transistors based on 2DEG.</p>

            <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their unique structural and functional properties. In the study of HEAs, thermodynamic properties and phase stability play a crucial role, making phase diagram calculations significantly important. However, phase diagram calculations with conventional CALPHAD assessments based on experimental or ab-initio data can be expensive. With the emergence of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we have developed a program named PhaseForge, which integrates MLIPs into the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) framework using our MLIP calculation library, MaterialsFramework, to enable efficient exploration of alloy phase diagrams. Moreover, our workflow can also serve as a benchmarking tool for evaluating the quality of different MLIPs.</p>

            <p>Skyrmions, originally from condensed matter physics, have been widely explored in various physical systems, including soft matter. A crucial challenge in manipulating topological solitary waves like skyrmions is controlling their flow on demand. Here, we control the arbitrary moving direction of skyrmions in a chiral liquid crystal system by adjusting the bias of the applied alternate current electric field. Specifically, the velocity, including both moving direction and speed can be continuously changed. The motion control of skyrmions originates from the symmetry breaking of the topological structure induced by flexoelectric-polarization effect. The omnidirectional control of topological solitons opens new avenues in light-steering and racetrack memories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerhard H. Fecher, Roshnee Sahoo, Claudia Felser</p>
            <p>MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Topological characterization of magnon-polaron bands and thermal Hall conductivity in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have not been addressed in the literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in a non-collinear antiferromagnet via two different kinds of coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their macroscopic origin. In the case of a local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytical approach through a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons, that renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes and yields a magnon-polaron quasiparticle state. In both the coupling regimes, the robust support of the topological signatures is derived systematically from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we witness transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity, which aid in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.</p>

            <h2>Electron-phonon coupling in Kekulé-ordered graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Szczȩśniak</p>
            <p>Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekulé-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekulé bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.</p>

We obtain the ground-state phase diagram, revealing a noncollinear phase and four distinct collinear phases. The ground state of the noncollinear phase fully breaks the spin rotational symmetry, while the ground state of the collinear phases possesses unbroken $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry. The resulting effective field theory for the noncollinear phase is an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ sigma model in which the magnonic excitation has three independent degrees of freedom and exhibits the $d$-wave-like anisotropic linear dispersion. We also discuss possible topological solitons, including $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices.</p>

Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.</p>

            <p>The structural distortions, orbital correlations, and electronic states in cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) were investigated using complementary characterisation techniques, including SR-XRD, HAXPES, XANES, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. SR-XRD confirms phase purity and reveals a temperature-dependent superlattice reflection between 200 K and 100 K, consistent with the emergence of short-range orbital ordering driven by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion (JTD). The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing and the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet splitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core levels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES analysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions. Temperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local disorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by enhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation redistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily affecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100 K) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports these findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in the same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation and exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour. Together, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly involving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence, and orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.</p>

            <p>This communication presents an examination of a two-dimensional, non-Hermitian Su -Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is differentiated from its conventional Hermitian counterpart by incorporating gain and/or loss terms, mathematically represented by imaginary on-site potentials.

Utilization of the rank-nullity theorem and graphical analysis of the phase rigidity factor enable identification of true exceptional points. Furthermore, this investigation achieves vectorized Zak phase quantization and examines a topolectric RLC circuit to derive the corresponding topological boundary resonance condition and the quantum Hall susceptance. Although Chern number quantization is not feasible, staggered hopping amplitudes corresponding to unit-cell lattice sites lead to broken inversion symmetry with non-zero Berry curvature, resulting in finite anomalous Nernst conductivity.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetism and superconductivity can lead to intriguing emergent phenomena. Here we combine two different two-dimensional antiferromagnetic magnet-superconductor hybrids (MSH) and study their properties using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Both MSHs show the characteristics of a topological nodal point superconducting phase with edge modes to the trivial substrate superconductor. At the boundary between the two MSHs we find low-energy modes which are spin-polarized. Based on a tight-binding model we can explain the experimental observations by considering two different topological nodal point superconductors. This gives rise to spin-polarized chiral edge modes that connect topological nodal points of the two different MSH. We demonstrate via the complex band structure that due to an asymmetric lateral decay these edge modes are spin-polarized, regardless of the details of the spin structure at the boundary. The presence of spin-polarized edge states between different topological superconductors enables advanced functional design for the exploitation of MSHs as a platform for topology-based applications.</p>

            <p>Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.</p>

The corresponding eigenstates also manifest nontrivial skin effects or extended behaviors arising from the interplay between BZ and GBZ structures. Furthermore, we can generalize our control by incorporating similarity transformations and holomorphic mappings with the boundary controls. We demonstrate the winding control numerically within various models, which enriches our knowledge of non-Hermitian physics across the spectrum, topology, and bulk-boundary correspondence.</p>

The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p>

            <p>Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</p>

            <h2>Role of hydrogen dynamics and deposition conditions in photochromic YHO/MoO$_3$ bilayer films</h2>

            <p>Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$) bilayer films (YHO/MoO$_3$) are produced using reactive magnetron sputtering, and their photochromic properties are investigated in relation to the thickness and density of the MoO$_3$ layer. Compared to single YHO films, the YHO/MoO$_3$ films exhibit faster coloration and larger contrast, with both parameters adjustable by varying the thickness or deposition pressure of the MoO$_3$ layer. Transparent YHO/MoO$_3$ films (~75% at 550 nm) demonstrate a photochromic contrast of up to 60%, significantly higher than the 25-30% contrast observed for single YHO films after 20 hours of UVA-violet light exposure. This enhancement arises from hydrogen intercalation from the (200)-textured polycrystalline YHO film into the X-ray amorphous MoO$_3$, leading to the formation of molybdenum bronze (HxMoO$_3$), as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopies. However, the darkened YHO/MoO$_3$ films do not fully recover to their initial transparency after illumination due to the irreversible nature of the coloured MoO$_3$ layer. Most of the hydrogen intercalated into MoO$_3$ originates from the YHO layer during the initial darkening process. Furthermore, the bilayer films are chemically unstable, exhibiting gradual darkening over time even without intentional UV illumination, as confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis.</p>

            <h2>Band-like Exact Zero-energy Andreev Bound States and Superconducting Diode Effect in Mixed ${s+p}$-wave Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu-Tong Guan, Jin An</p>
            <p>Topological Josephson junctions enable nonreciprocal transport involving Majorana fermions (MFs). Here we examine a topological Josephson junction with mixed $s$+$p$-wave pairing, where topological phase transition can be driven by adjusting the ratio between the pairing components. There exist two exact symmetrically positioned zero-energy level crossings for the Andreev-bound states, which can be shifted by external fields, and can be destroyed or recreated in pairs by a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field or inhomogeneities, exhibiting band-like structure. The dependence of the shift on the Zeeman field is linear when the two $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors on both sides are identical while quadratic when they are distinct. Near the topological phase transition, the topological $p$-wave dominant junctions host MF-induced pronounced superconducting diode effect with high efficiency factor $Q$ up to 30 %, in contrast to the trivial $s$-wave dominant junctions possessing relatively small $Q$.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</p>

            <p>Heterogeneous nucleation at surface edges is pervasive across nature and industry, yet the role of line tension, arising from asymmetric capillary interactions at geometric singularities, remains poorly understood. Herein we develop a generalized nucleation theory that explicitly incorporates line tension induced by edge pinning, thereby extending classical frameworks to account for nanoscale confinement and interfacial asymmetry. Through analytical treatment of droplet formation within geometrically defined nanopores, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge-pinned line tension as a function of Laplace pressure, pore geometry, and wettability. This formulation reveals that line tension can significantly reshape the nucleation energy landscape, introducing nontrivial dependencies on contact angle and pore morphology. Our results uncover a tunable, geometry-mediated mechanism for controlling nucleation barriers, offering predictive insight into phase transitions in confined environments and suggesting new strategies for design in applications ranging from nanofluidics to crystallization control.</p>

            <h2>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</p>

            <p>The emergent properties of materials are defined by the symmetries of their underlying atomic, spin and charge order. The explorations of symmetry breaking effects are therefore usually limited by the intrinsic properties of known, stable materials. In recent years, advances in focused ion beam (FIB) fabrication have enabled the nanostructuring of bulk crystals into ultraprecise transport devices [1-4], facilitating the investigation of geometrical effects on mesoscopic length scales. In this work, we expand such explorations into three-dimensional (3D), curvilinear shapes, by sculpting helical nanostructure devices from single crystals of the high-mobility, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ [5,6]. The combination of the imposed chiral geometry and intrinsic ferromagnetism yields nonreciprocal electron transport [7-9]. The high coercivity results in an anomalous, reversable diode effect remnant under zero applied magnetic field, which is orders of magnitude larger than can be explained by a classical self-field mechanism. We argue the enhancement originates from the high carrier mobility and the resulting quasi-ballistic transport: the conduction electron mean free path approaches the length scale of the curvature, resulting in increased asymmetrical scattering at the boundaries. We further demonstrate the inverse effect of the nonreciprocal transport: the field-free, current-induced switching of the magnetisation. The results establish the vast potential of 3D nanosculpting to explore and enrich the functionality of quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Allemeier, İsmet İnönü Kaya, M. Selim Hanay, Kamil L. Ekinci</p>
            <p>We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.</p>

            <p>The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate tunable superconducting transitions in (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{KTaO}_3$ field-effect devices. Large increases in conductivity, associated with superconducting fluctuations, are observed far above the transition temperature. However, the standard Aslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity model significantly underestimates the effect observed here. We use a model that includes conductivity corrections from normal state quasiparticle interference together with all contributions from superconducting fluctuations evaluated at arbitrary temperatures and in the short-wavelength limit. Through analysis of the magnetoconductance and resistive transitions, we find that the large conductivity increase can be explained by a combination of weak anti-localization and Maki-Thompson superconducting fluctuations. Both contributions are enabled by a strong temperature dependence of the electron's decoherence time compatible with an electron-phonon scattering scenario. We find that conductivity corrections are modulated by the electrostatic field effect, that governs a competition between normal-state quasiparticle interference and superconducting fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into interaction-driven persistent droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we investigate the formation and dynamics of single droplet and droplet arrays in rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body states for 2D interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single droplet and droplet arrays states which are shown to be stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</p>

            <p>The complex physics of self-assembly in colloidal crystals on deformable interfaces and surfaces poses interesting possibilities for the designability and synthesis of next-generation metamaterials. The goal of this article is to characterize instabilities arising in colloidal crystals assembled on fluid membranes. The colloidal particles are modeled as pair-wise interacting point particles, constrained to lie on a fluid membrane and yet free to reorganize, and the membrane's elastic energy is modeled via the Helfrich energy. We find that when a collection of particles is arranged on a planar membrane in some regular fashion -- such as periodic lattice -- then the regular configuration admits bifurcations to non-planar configurations. Using the Bloch-wave anstaz for the mode of instabilities, we present a parameteric analysis of the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes. We find that instabilities can occur through two distinct kinds of modes, when the parameters belong in certain physically interesting regimes, referred to as long-wavenumber modes ($L$ modes) and short-wavenumber modes ($S$ modes) in the article. We discuss some connections between these results and recent experiments, as well as the open problem of budding in biomembranes.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectrics show a phase transition to a paraelectric phase at a well-defined transition temperature. Introducing disorder makes this transition diffuse, and the system becomes a relaxor. Since the degree of (dis-)order is usually manipulated by varying the chemical composition, it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between disorder and the degree of diffuseness. Perovskite structured lead scandium tantalate (Pb[Sc$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$]O$_3$, PST) offers the opportunity to tune the character of the transition by thermal annealing without changing the stoichiometry. Here it is demonstrated that there is a linear correlation between the structural ordering, quantified by the intensity ratio $S$ of the pseudocubic (111)/(200) x-ray diffraction peaks, and the diffuseness parameter $\gamma$ deduced from temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy. The relation is universal, independent of whether the sample is a thin film, multilayer capacitor or bulk ceramic, and also independent of the absolute value of the dielectric permittivity.</p>

            <p>We report observations of unusal \emph{first} plastic events in silica and metallic glasses in the shear startup regime at applied strain two orders of magnitude smaller than yield strain. The (non-Affine) particle displacement field during these events have complex real space structure with multiple disconnected cores of high displacement appearing at the \emph{same} applied strain under athermal quasistatic simple shear deformation, and identified by a ``cell based cluster analysis'' method. By monitoring the stress relaxation during the first plastic event by Langevin dynamics simulation, we directly show the cascade nature of these events. Thus these first plastic events are reminiscent of avalanches in the post-yielding steady state, but unlike the steady state avalanches, we show that these events are not system spanning. To understand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to affect brittleness of a glass. These are (i) sample preparation history, (ii) inter-particle interactions and (iii) rigidity of the background matrix applying a ``soft matrix'' probe recently developed by some of us. In each case we show that such first plastic events are more probable in more ductile glasses. Our observations are consistent with the picture that more ductile materials are softer, implying that understanding the role of softness may be a promising route to develop microscopic quantifiers of brittleness and thus clarifying the physical origin of brittle-to-ductile transition.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate a "robust superconductivity phenomenon" in niobium-based alloys, where the superconducting state remains intact and the critical temperature ($T_c$) is largely unaffected by external pressure well above tens of gigapascal (GPa) into the megabar regime ($\ge 100 GPa$). Motivated by these observations, we perform first-principles electron-phonon calculations for body-centered cubic Nb and NbTi crystals, as well as for special quasi-random structures of Nb$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$ and (NbTa)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.3}$ high-entropy alloy (HEA). The calculations unravel the underlying mechanism of robust superconductivity, stemming from a compensation effect between varying electronic and phonon properties under pressure. The results also reveal how structural and chemical disorders modify the superconducting state. The first-principles $T_c$ values agree quantitatively with the experiments throughout the entire pressure range under study. Our work thereby paves the way for exploring superconducting HEAs under pressure via advanced first-principles simulations.</p>

The resulting integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features. For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the complex plane.</p>

            <p>Clustering and degree correlations are ubiquitous in real-world complex networks. Yet, understanding their role in critical phenomena remains a challenge for theoretical studies. Here, we provide the exact solution of site percolation in a model for strongly clustered random graphs, with many overlapping loops and heterogeneous degree distribution. We systematically compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field. These findings highlight the need for new approaches, beyond the heterogeneous mean-field theory, to accurately describe phase transitions in complex networks with realistic topological features.</p>

            <p>Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm, coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Kullig, Jan Wiersig, Henning Schomerus</p>
            <p>The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</p>

            <h2>A Qubit as a Bridge Between Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manmeet Kaur, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>This work presents a unified perspective on thermal equilibrium and quantum dynamics by examining the simplest quantum system, a qubit, as a foundational model. We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt amplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along different paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode dynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and quantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the Cauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds to early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from a single qubit to an interacting spin chain.</p>

            <p>Quantitative visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based Artificial Intelligence method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</p>

            <p>Utilizing quantum effects in nanoscopic devices has in the past mostly been accessible through academic cleanrooms and research foundries. Opening the quantum frontier for wider industrial applications likely requires the scale of well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries for manufacturing transistor-based quantum devices operable above subkelvin temperatures. Here, we operate a commercial 22-nm-node fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS device as dual parallel-connected charge-pumps for the implementation of a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure the accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A for this scalable architecture at 50 MHz with reference to SI-traceable voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. Looking ahead we propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel-connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This can be operated as a table-top primary standard, generating quantum currents up to microampere levels.</p>

            <h2>An equation of motion for unsteady frictional slip pulses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eran Bouchbinder</p>
            <p>Frictional sliding, e.g., earthquakes along geological faults, are mediated either by frictional crack-like ruptures, where interfacial (fault) slip is accumulated during the entire sliding event, or by frictional pulse-like ruptures, featuring a finite length over which slip is accumulated. Our basic understanding of slip pulses, which are believed to dominate most crustal earthquakes, is still incomplete. Here, building on recent progress, we present an analytic equation of motion for rate-and-state frictional slip pulses, which are intrinsically unstable spatiotemporal objects, in terms of a single degree of freedom. The predictions of the equation are supported by large-scale simulations of growing pulses and reveal the origin of the slow development of their instability, which explains the dynamic relevance of pulses in a broad range of natural and manmade frictional systems.</p>

            <p>The decay of electrical charge on a dielectric surface in nitrogen-C4F7N (Novec4710, C4) mixtures is investigated using measurement of electric field via in-situ electric field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) technique. The charge is deposited on the surface of the alumina by generating a barrier discharge in the gap, and the amount of charge is determined from electrical current measurements and numerical modeling. For different admixtures (0, 10, and 50 percent) of C4F7N in nitrogen, the presence of surface charge is detected even 60 hours after charge deposition. It is found that C4F7N admixture lead to a significantly longer-lasting surface charge, indicating a slower charge decay. Using an isothermal charge decay model, charge traps are identified for pure nitrogen charge deposition, which are in agreement with results found in the literature. Charge deposition in C4F7N admixtures leads to modification or creation of new traps with higher trap energies. The EFISH measurements are used to determine the C4F7N nonlinear hyperpolarizability tensor component. Direct comparison of the experimental results from two developed methods (EFISH and electrical measurements) and the numerical model gives a closer insight into the surface charge spread over the dielectrics, resulting in surface charge density estimation.</p>

            <p>The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincaré group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT). We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS. Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</p>

            <p>Bismuth nanoparticles are being investigated due to their reported photothermal and photocatalytic properties. In this study, we synthesised spherical bismuth nanoparticles (50-600 nm) and investigated their structural and optical properties at the single particle level using analytical transmission electron microscopy.

Furthermore, plasmonic resonances demonstrate stability across the entire spectral bandwidth, enhancing the attractiveness of bismuth nanoparticles for applications over a wide spectral range. Bismuth's lower cost, biocompatibility, and oxidation resistance make it a suitable candidate for utilisation, particularly in industrial and large-scale plasmonic applications.</p>

            <h2>Robust global tripartite entanglement in a mixed spin-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Vargová</p>
            <p>We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.</p>

            <h2>The quantification of a genuine tetrapartite entanglement in a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Vargová, Jozef Strečka</p>
            <p>The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree of entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity at zero and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type of intra- ($J$) and inter-dimer ($J_1$) exchange coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the antiferromagnetic-inter dimer $J_1>0$ coupling, whereas the character of with respect to $J$ ($J>0$ or $J<0$) determines its zero-temperature magnitude and its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is demonstrated for $0<J_1/J<1$ the genuine tetrapartite negativity is dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling $J_1$. It is found, that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a Cu$_2$Ni$_2$ magnetic core.</p>

            <h2>Dislocations and crystallization dynamics of chiral soliton lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minoru Eto, Kentaro Nishimura, Muneto Nitta</p>
            <p>Dislocations, as topological defects in crystal lattices, are fundamental to understanding plasticity in materials. Similar periodic structures also arise in continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which appear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy contexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid rotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form within such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the aforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the ground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation or leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not contain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the topological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying the topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations, we study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions. In 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later annihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations form; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field. We find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix staircase or DNA. We then demonstrate the formation of helical dislocations and analyze how the external field strength affects CSL density and formation speed. Our results provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding dislocations in solitonic structures, connecting high-energy field theory with materials science phenomena.</p>

            <p>Quantum interference and entanglement are in the core of quantum computations. The fast spread of information in the quantum circuit helps to mitigate the circuit depth. Although the information scrambling in the closed systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual information strongly depends on the system-environment and environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in discrete-variable photonic computing.</p>

            <p>The Lindblad equation for open quantum systems is central to our understanding of coherence and entanglement in the presence of Markovian dissipation. In closed quantum systems Hilbert-space fragmentation is an effective mechanism for slowing decoherence in the presence of constrained interactions. We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation of mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free Hamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator algebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical partitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of superoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information spreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly entangled quantum states and dynamics. Our approach yields two key advances. Firstly, we introduce frustration graphs in operator space as a compact representation to construct effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in individual fragments and diagnose their free-fermion solvability. Secondly, using these methods we uncover a range of universal dynamical regimes in Pauli-Lindblad models, exhibiting symmetry enriched quantum chaos and integrability in operator-space fragments. Furthermore, we show dissipation-driven phase transitions corresponding to exceptional points in the Lindbladian spectrum whose signatures are captured by spectral statistics and operator dynamics. These results establish operator-space fragmentation as a fundamental principle for open quantum systems, with immediate implications for quantum error correction, where protected subspaces could emerge naturally from fragmentation. Our framework provides a systematic approach to discover and characterize novel non-equilibrium phases in open quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Polar solitons, i.e., solitonic waves accompanying asymmetry of geometry or phase, have garnered attention in polar systems, such as ferroelectric or magnetoelectric materials, where they play a critical role in topological transitions and nonreciprocal responses to external fields. A key question is whether such polar solitons can emerge in nonpolar systems, where intrinsic polarity is absent. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented polar soliton with nematic order in a nonpolar and chiral liquid crystal system by applying an alternating electric field. The soliton is corn-kernel-shaped, displaying a pair of oppositely charged topological defects at its two ends. While head-to-head collision between the solitons leads to repulsion, head-to-tail collision attracts the solitons into a single polar soliton. A rich variety of solitonic kinetics, such as rectilinear translation and circulation motions, can be activated by controlling the voltage and frequency of an electric field. Simulations reveal that the formation of the polar solitons is achieved through balancing the electric and nematic elastic energies, while the flexoelectric effect drives their rotational behaviors. The discovery of polar solitons in nonpolar systems expands the understanding of topological solitons, opening new avenues for dynamic control in soft matter systems, with potential applications in nonreciprocal responsive materials and topological information storage.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</p>

            <p>The emergence of synchrony essentially underlies the functionality of many systems across physics, biology and engineering. In all established synchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is connected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable synchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas for discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable incoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of transition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does not connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the complexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength parameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a quaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the mechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests that the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in contrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between synchrony and incoherence so far.</p>

The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate high accuracy classification for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset ($\sim$98.00$\%$) and RGB images from the CIFAR-10 dataset ($\sim$86.80$\%$) by using resistive memories based on a 2D van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). These memories are fabricated via dry thermal oxidation, forming vertical crossbar HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ devices with a highly-ordered oxide-semiconductor structure. Our devices operate without electroforming or current compliance and exhibit multi-state, non-volatile resistive switching, allowing resistance to be tuned using voltage pulse trains. Using low-energy potentiation and depression pulses (0.7V-0.995V, 160ns-350ns), we achieve 31 ($\sim$5 bits) stable conductance states with high linearity, symmetry, and low variation over 100 cycles. Key performance metrics-such as weight update, quantisation, and retention-are extracted from these experimental devices. These characteristics are used to simulate neural networks with our resistive memories as weights. Neural networks are trained on state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital hardware (CUDA cores) and a baseline inference accuracy is extracted. IBM's Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit (AIHWKIT) is used to modify and remap digital weights in the pretrained network, based on the characteristics of our devices. Simulations account for factors like conductance linearity, device variation, and converter resolution. In both image recognition tasks, we demonstrate excellent performance, similar to SOTA, with only $<$0.07$\%$ and $<$1.00$\%$ difference in inference accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively.

            <p>We present a molecular simulation method to simultaneously find multiple transition pathways, and their associated free-energy profiles. The scheme extends path-metadynamics (PMD) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020601 (2012)] with multiple paths and repulsive walkers (multiPMD). We illustrate multiPMD for two C7eq-to-C7ax paths in Ace-Ala-Nme and six PPII-to-PPII paths in Ace-(Pro)4-Nme. We also show a scheme to render an interpretable "PathMap", showing the free energy ridges between paths, as well as the branching and merging of the transition channels. MultiPMD is a flexible and promising method for systems with competing or controversial pathways, which appear in many biomolecular systems, including proteins and nucleic acids.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale defects such as dislocations, have a significant impact on the phonon thermal transport properties in non-metallic materials. To unravel these effects, understanding of defect phonon modes is essential. Herein, at the atomic scale, the localized phonons of individual dislocation at a Si/Ge interface are measured via monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. These modes are then correlated with the local microstructure, further revealing the dislocation effects on the local thermal transport properties. The dislocation causes phonon redshift in several milli-electron-volts within about two to four nanometers of the core, where both of the strain field and Ge-segregation play roles. With the presence of dislocation, the local interfacial thermal conductance can be either enhanced or reduced, depending on the complex interaction and competition between lattice-disorder (dislocation) and element-disorder (heterointerface mixing and Ge-segregation) at the interface. These findings provide valuable insights to improve the thermal properties of thermoelectric generators and thermal management systems through proper defect engineering.</p>

            <p>Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.</p>

            <p>The application of in-plane magnetic fields to Josephson junctions enables fundamental exploration of quantum phenomena, including Zeeman-driven 0-$\pi$ transitions and planar topological superconductivity. However, intrinsic orbital effects arising from nanoscale rippled geometries in practical devices can dominate phase interference signatures, complicating their interpretation. Here, we experimentally probe superconducting interference in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions under combined perpendicular and in-plane magnetic fields. The critical supercurrent reveals a distinct diamond-shaped interference pattern, with nodes progressively opening and evolving into V-shaped features, reminiscent of suppression-recovery patterns associated with 0-$\pi$ transitions. We theoretically analyze the interplay between orbital effects from rippled geometries and non-uniform supercurrent density distributions, demonstrating that their synergistic interaction could reproduce the experimentally observed interference evolution. Our findings elucidate how geometric imperfections and current inhomogeneity cooperatively reshape phase interference, providing critical insights into orbital-dominated phenomena in Josephson systems.</p>

            <h2>Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyak Jain, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a mutually perpendicular dipole pair move together along helical geodesics, thus acting as curvature checkers, analogous to vortex dipoles. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).</p>

            <p>An extension of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to derive a "speed limit" theorem for nonlinear electronic devices. This speed limit provides a lower bound on the dissipation that is incurred when transferring a given amount of electric charge in a certain amount of time with a certain noise level (average variance of the current). This bound, which implies a high energy dissipation for fast, low-noise operations (such as switching a bit in a digital memory), brings together recent results of stochastic thermodynamics into a form that is usable for practical nonlinear electronic circuits, as we illustrate on a switching circuit made of an nMOS pass gate in a state-of-the-art industrial technology.</p>

            <p>The rise of moiré materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</p>

            <p>Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinghua He, Wenlong Gao, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Conventional topological materials rely on band-specific mechanisms -- such as band inversion or spin-orbit coupling -- to realize nontrivial topological invariants. Here, we introduce a symmetry-driven paradigm for generating topological states, exploiting a translational symmetry $\mathcal{L}$ that couples two maximal Wyckoff positions. This symmetry induces robust band degeneracies independent of band structure details, allowing us to classify $\mathcal{L}$ as trivial or nontrivial by quantized electric multipoles. Crucially, for nontrivial $\mathcal{L}$, symmetry-protected edge and corner states emerge universally across all symmetry-compatible insulating, semi-metallic, and metallic phases, irrespective of specific band structure. We demonstrate this in a $C_4$-symmetric model and validate it using an experimentally feasible dielectric photonic crystal engineered with $\mathcal{L}$ symmetry. Through full-wave simulation, we observe directional edge modes and localized corner modes, with the former selectively excited by harmonic point sources spatially shifted by $\mathcal{L}$ at a fixed frequency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl J Friston, Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel</p>
            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debashish Mondal, Rekha Kumari, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n_{M}\times 2e^{2}/h$ in summed differential conductance with $n_{M}$ being the number of modes~($0$ or $\pi$) localized at one end of the NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.</p>

In the retina, ganglion cells detect features from sparse inputs via lateral inhibition, where neurons antagonistically suppress activity of neighbouring cells. Biological neurons exhibit diverse heterogeneous nonlinear responses, linked to robust learning and strong performance in low-data regimes. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' photonic system where spatially-competing lasing modes in a network laser act as heterogeneous, inhibitively-coupled neurons - enabling few-shot classification and segmentation. This compact (150 micron) silicon-compatible scheme addresses key challenges in photonic computing: physical nonlinearity and spatial footprint. We report 98.05% and 87.85% accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and 90.12% on BreaKHis cancer diagnosis - outperforming software CNNs including EfficientNet in few-shot and class-imbalanced regimes.

            <p>We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.</p>

            <p>The moiré structure of AB-stacked $\rm{MoTe_2/WSe_2}$ represents a natural platform to realize Kondo lattice models, due to the discrepancy of the bandwidth between the individual layers. Here, we study this system at the commensurate filling of $\nu_{\rm tot}=2$. Our focus is on the $1+1$ filling setting of $\nu_{\rm Mo} =\nu_{\rm W}=1$, which enables a Kondo lattice description. We find a Kondo semimetal due to the sizable intra-orbital hopping among the electrons in the $\rm{MoTe_2}$ layer. The Kondo-driven (emergent) flat band is naturally pinned to the Fermi energy. When combined with the inherent topology of the electronic structure, a topological Kondo semimetal phase ensues. We calculate the valley Hall response and, due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, also identify a spontaneous Hall effect. There is a Berry curvature dodecapole, which leads to a fourth-order spontaneous Hall effect in the perturbative regime of the electric field that is further amplified in the non-perturbative regime. As such, the system provides a tunable setting to simulate topological Kondo semimetals. Finally, we discuss the pathways that connect the physics realized here to the Weyl Kondo semimetals and their proximate phases that have been advanced in recent years in topological Kondo lattice models and materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saikat Mondal, Adhip Agarwala</p>
            <p>In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes of the scalar field. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</p>

            <p>We explore the phase diagram of the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT), focusing on the effects of particle-hole asymmetry (PHA) in the single-band Hubbard model. Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T<T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.</p>

            <p>Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.</p>

            <p>In a class of systems, there are gapped boundary-localized states described by a boundary Hamiltonian. The topological classification of gapped boundary Hamiltonians, same as the standard tenfold way for gapped bulk states, can lead to the emergence of boundary topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (TSCs). In this work, we present a theoretical study of boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes. Based on the boundary projection analyses for a $d$-dimensional Dirac continuum model, we demonstrate that nontrivial boundary topology can arise at a $(d-n)$-dimensional boundary if the Dirac model incorporates ($n+1$) mass terms with $0<n<d$ although its bulk and $(d-1)$D, $\cdots$, $(d-n+1)$D boundaries are topologically trivial. Furthermore, we present a unified criterion for the emergence of nontrivial boundary topology by extending bulk classification within the context of the Dirac model, which provides a unified framework for nontrivial bulk and boundary topology. Inspired by the Dirac continuum model analysis, we further construct bulk lattice Hamiltonians for realizing boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes, which enables the realization of higher-order TIs and TSCs in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary orders. We analyze some typical examples of the constructed boundary TIs and TSCs in physical dimensions.</p>

These thresholds serve as a predictive tool for identifying defects likely to degrade SRF cavity performance. We then simulate the resulting dissipation and show how aggregate contributions from multiple small defects can reproduce trends consistent with high-field $Q$-slope behavior observed experimentally.

While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</p>

            <h2>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl</p>
            <p>We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</p>

            <h2>Magic sizes enable minimal-complexity, high-fidelity assembly of programmable shells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Botond Tyukodi, Fernando Caballero, Daichi Hayakawa, Douglas M. Hall, W. Benjamin Rogers, Gregory M. Grason, Michael F. Hagan</p>
            <p>Recent advances in synthetic methods enable designing subunits that self-assemble into structures with precise, finite sizes and well-defined architectures, but yields are frequently suppressed by the formation of off-target metastable structures. Increasing the complexity (the number of distinct subunit types) can inhibit off-target structures, but leads to slower kinetics and higher synthesis costs. Here, we study icosahedral shells formed of programmable triangular subunits as a model system, and identify design principles that produce the highest target yield at the lowest complexity. We use a symmetry-based construction to create a range of design complexities, starting from the maximal symmetry Caspar-Klug assembly up to the fully addressable, zero-symmetry assembly. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the most prominent defects leading to off-target assemblies are disclinations at sites of rotational symmetry. We derive symmetry-based rules for identifying the optimal (lowest-complexity, highest-symmetry) design that inhibits these disclinations, leading to robust, high-fidelity assembly of targets with arbitrarily large, yet precise, finite sizes. The optimal complexity varies non-monotonically with target size, with `magic' sizes appearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect vertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require 12 times fewer inequivalent interaction-types than the (minimal symmetry) fully addressable construction, which greatly reduces the timescale and experimental cost required to achieve high fidelity assembly of large targets. This symmetry-based principle for pruning off-target assembly generalizes to diverse architectures with different topologies.</p>

            <h2>System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, Francesco Caravelli, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.</p>

            <h2>A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolin Wille, Maksimilian Usoltcev, Jens Eisert, Alexander Altland</p>
            <p>This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</p>

            <h2>Hamiltonian-learning quantum magnets with non-local impurity tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Greta Lupi, Jose L. Lado</p>
            <p>Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</p>

            <p>Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero net transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the ``magnetic memory effect'' observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without translational symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lunts, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without translational symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</p>

            <p>Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</p>

Beyond the well-known Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky's inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism for the noncollinearly ordered magnets, we point out the induction of the electric polarizations in the multipolar ordered Mott insulators. Using the multiflavor representation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover or transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure multipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the intermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to inspire a reexamination of ferroelectricity in the multipolar-ordered magnets.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Brownian information engine with finite cycle time: Optimisation of output work, power and efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syed Yunus Ali, Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal</p>
            <p>We consider a Geometric Brownian Information Engine to explore the effects of finite cycle time $(\tau)$ on the extractable work, power, and efficiency. We incorporate an error-free feedback controller that converts the information obtained about the state of overdamped Brownian particles, confined within a 2-D monolobal geometry, into extractable work. The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period $(\tau)$, measurement distance $(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the controller. Upon increasing the feedback cycle time, the engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state. We set the measurement distance at an optimum position related to a fully relaxed state ($x_m^* \sim 0.6 \sigma$). When the cycle time is finite and short ($\tau <\tau_r$), the best information processing occurs with a shorter distance of the feedback site. While increasing the cycle time towards a fully relaxed state ($\tau \gg \tau_r$), the maximum extractable work that can be achieved with a feedback location is set to be twice that of $x_m^*$, as expected. When the cycle time ($\tau$) is longer than the relaxation time ($\tau_r$), the maximum power is achieved when the scaled feedback location is exactly double the optimum measurement distance ($x_f^{*}=2x_m^*$). In contrast, when $\tau < \tau_r$, the maximum power is achieved when the feedback site is set at a lower value. As the $\tau$ increases, the maximum average power decreases. In the limit of a long $\tau$, the highest efficiency as well extractable work is attained when $x_f$ is located at $2x_m$, regardless of the level of entropic control. As the dominance of entropic control increases, the extractable work and efficiency in the fully relaxed state decrease due to higher information loss during relaxation.</p>

            <p>An ab initio scheme based on the Kubo-Greenwood linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.</p>

            <p>Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications.

This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka</p>
            <p>Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.</p>

In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>We study the spectral properties and local topology of the Kane-Mele-Rashba model on a Sierpinski Carpet (SC) fractal, constructed from a rectangular flake with an underlying honeycomb arrangement and open boundary conditions. When the system parameters correspond to a topologically trivial phase, the energy spectrum is characterized solely by bulk states that are not significantly modified by the system's fractality. For parameters corresponding to the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, in addition to bulk states, the energy spectrum exhibits in-gap topological states that are strongly influenced by the fractal geometry. As the fractal generation increases, the in-gap topological states acquire a staircase profile, which translates into sharp peaks in the density of states. We also show that both the QSHI and the trivial phase exhibit a large gap in the valence-projected spin spectrum, allowing the use of the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) to index the local topology of the system. Fractality does not affect this gap, allowing the application of LSCM to higher fractal generations. Our results explore the LSCM versatility, showing its potential to access local topology in complex geometries such as fractal systems.</p>

            <p>This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the magnetization, and the aspect ratio of the strip cross-section. We analyze the changes of the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field with an increasing thickness-to-width ratio, assuming a fixed magnetization direction corresponding to the strongest magnetoelastic coupling. For Love wave, the contribution of the out-of-plane component increases monotonically, while that of the in-plane component decreases monotonically. In the case of the Rayleigh wave, only the out-of-plane component contributes, and it approaches zero as the cross-section becomes square. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</p>

            <p>We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk, with a symmetric jump distribution, under stochastic resetting. Associated with the random walker are cost functions for jumps and resets, and we calculate the distribution of the total cost for the random walker up to the first passage to the target. By using the backward master equation approach we demonstrate that the distribution of the total cost up to the first passage to the target can be reduced to a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. The resulting integral equation can be exactly solved (in Laplace space) for arbitrary cost functions for the jump and selected functions for the reset cost. We show that the large cost behaviour is dominated by resetting or the jump distribution according to the choice of the jump distribution. In the important case of a Laplace jump distribution, which corresponds to run-and-tumble particle dynamics, and linear costs for jumps and resetting, the Wiener-Hopf equation simplifies to a differential equation which can easily be solved.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Collective modes in superconductors including Coulomb repulsion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Althüser, Götz S. Uhrig</p>
            <p>We numerically study the collective excitations present in isotropic superconductors including a screened Coulomb interaction. By varying the screening strength, we analyze its impact on the system. We use a formulation of the effective phonon-mediated interaction between electrons that depends on the energy transfer between particles, rather than being a constant in a small energy shell around the Fermi edge. This justifies considering also rather large attractive interactions. We compute the system's Green's functions using the iterated equations of motion (iEoM) approach, which ultimately enables a quantitative analysis of collective excitations. For weak couplings, we identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) mode at the two-particle continuum's lower edge and the phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode at $\omega = 0$ for a neutral system, which shifts to higher energies as the Coulomb interaction is switched on. As the phononic coupling is increased, the Higgs mode separates from the continuum, and additional phase and amplitude modes appear, persisting even in the presence Coulomb interactions.</p>

            <h2>Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam L.H. Lau, Andreas Gleis, Daniel Kaplan, Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman</p>
            <p>We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</p>

            <h2>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsu Yi, Panayotis Benetatos</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</p>

            <h2>Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier</p>
            <p>The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.</p>

            <h2>A non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tigran V. Shahbazyan</p>
            <p>We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</p>

            <p>We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.</p>

            <p>According to Zaanen's interpretation of Homes' empirical law~[Zaanen, {\it Nature} {\bf 430}, 512 (2004)], the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are high because their metallic states are as viscous as quantum mechanics permits. Here, we show that Homes' law in fact implies three key points: (i) the resistivity is linear in temperature in the normal state near the transition temperature; (ii) the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality of the relaxation rate with temperature is of order unity -- the so-called universal Planckian relaxation rate; and (iii) the logarithmically broad applicability of this law arises from an unusually wide range of effective masses throughout the cuprate phase diagram. In fact, a universal Planckian relaxation rate implies Homes' law only if the mechanism of mass renormalization is independent of the Planckian relaxation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Abilio, Krisztián Palotás</p>
            <p>The revised Chen's derivative rule for electron tunneling is implemented to enable computationally efficient first-principles-based calculations of the differential conductance dI/dV for scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) simulations. The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and its electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron orbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from first-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and boron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of our implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained by the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is highlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to dI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the particular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the electron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in their dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an unprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms of tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be extremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel material surfaces in the future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Busel, D. Polishchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski</p>
            <p>We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the Néel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the Néel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the Néel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the Néel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.</p>

            <h2>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Kishigi, Yasumasa Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</p>

            <p>In this work, we obtain the expression, within the linear response approximation, that allows the direct calculation of the superfluid weight for strongly inhomogeneous superconductors. Using this expression, we find that, in general, the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the superconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential is important in superconductors with a strongly inhomogeneous pairing potential. We consider two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the pairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when superconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both cases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant, it must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the case when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that does not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay V. Gnezdilov, Rufus Boyack</p>
            <p>Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. In particular, depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sondre Duna Lundemo, Flavio S. Nogueira, Asle Sudbø</p>
            <p>The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the Néel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+1$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.</p>

            <p>Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</p>

            <p>Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</p>

            <p>Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have shown unique multi-level resistive switching capabilities. However, the physical processes governing their behavior, and specifically the atomistic mechanisms of forming, remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the forming mechanism at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extended charge equilibration scheme, based on a combination of the charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) formalism and the electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID) method, is employed to model the localized effects of applied voltage. Our simulations reveal that tantalum ions exhibit the highest displacement under applied voltage, followed by hafnium ions, while oxygen ions respond only minimally. This results in the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode (anode), and the clustering of oxygen vacancies near the negative bottom electrode (cathode), where the conductive filament nucleates. This ionic segregation partially shields the bulk dielectric from the applied electric field, hindering further migration of ions in the vertical direction. We find that a minimum threshold voltage is required to initiate vacancy clustering. Filament growth proceeds through a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which are stabilized near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</p>

            <p>We propose an extension of Schrödinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrödinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</p>

            <p>Non-Abelian gauge offers a powerful route to engineer novel topological phenomena. Here, we systematically investigate a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model incorporating SU(2) non-Abelian gauge, demonstrating the emergence of Hopf-link bulk braiding topology in the complex energy spectrum solely with x-direction nearest-neighbor couplings. Because of the limitations of exceptional point (EP) topology in fully capturing the rich non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under non-Abelian influence, we introduce a novel polarization parameter derived from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). This parameter quantitatively discerns left-, right-, and notably, bipolar skin modes, with its accuracy corroborated by directly encoding real-space eigenstate. Our findings reveal that non-Abelian gauge provides unprecedented influence over NHSE, compared with Abelian gauge and without gauge cases. Furthermore, we uncover unique characteristics of zero-imaginary-energy eigenstates at these topological boundaries, including pronounced degeneracy and bipolar localization which is unaffected by size effects, investigated via dynamical evolution and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). This work establishes a new paradigm for synthesizing and manipulating non-Hermitian topological phases driven by non-Abelian structures, opening avenues for topological engineering and holding promise for experimental realization in synthetic dimensional platforms.</p>

            <h2>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</p>

            <h2>Tailored ordering enables high-capacity cathode materials</h2>

            <p>Newly designed Li-ion battery cathode materials with high capacity and greater flexibility in chemical composition will be critical for the growing electric vehicles market. Cathode structures with cation disorder were once considered suboptimal, but recent demonstrations have highlighted their potential in Li$_{1+x}$M$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$ chemistries with a wide range of metal combinations M. By relaxing the strict requirements of maintaining ordered Li diffusion pathways, countless multi-metal compositions in LiMO$_2$ may become viable, aiding the quest for high-capacity cobalt-free cathodes. A challenge presented by this freedom in composition space is designing compositions which possess specific, tailored types of both long- and short-range orderings, which can ensure both phase stability and Li diffusion. However, the combinatorial complexity associated with local cation environments impedes the development of general design guidelines for favorable orderings. Here we propose ordering design frameworks from computational ordering descriptors, which in tandem with low-cost heuristics and elemental statistics can be used to simultaneously achieve compositions that possess favorable phase stability as well as configurations amenable to Li diffusion. Utilizing this computational framework, validated through multiple successful synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$O$_2$, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 mAhg$^{-1}$ and 320 mAhg$^{-1}$ in its 20% Li-excess variant Li$_{1.2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_2$, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first-principles studies of ordering tendencies known to us.</p>

            <h2>Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Liu, Juhao Wu, Mark Ying</p>
            <p>By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vittorio Erba, Nathan Malo Kupferschmid, Rodrigo Pérez Ortiz, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</p>

            <h2>Solitonic Andreev Spin Qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada</p>
            <p>We propose a novel type of superconducting spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. The two SASQ states are the degenerate spin orientations of an Andreev bound state trapped in a circular Josephson junction with a Corbino disk geometry, created on a 2DEG. The junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The fluxoid mismatch produces a cancellation of the induced pairing that traps unconventional spin-degenerate Andreev bound states analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi soliton states. They are localized at a position around the junction that can be controlled by changing the superconducting phase difference. Moving a soliton state with a phase bias induces a holonomic rotation of its spin, by virtue of the spin-orbit coupling in the 2DEG. The holonomic qubit trajectories can densely cover the full Bloch sphere as the soliton state revolves around the junction. Effects of non-holonomic (dynamic) qubit drift are also analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping entanglement in quantum spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaju Zhang, Arash Jafarizadeh, M. A. Rajabpour</p>
            <p>In this paper, we employ the bootstrap method, a technique that relies on consistency relations instead of direct diagonalization, to determine the expectation values in quantum many-body systems. We then use these values to assess the entanglement content of the system. Our work extends the bootstrap approach to quantum many-body systems, rather than single-body or few-body systems, concentrating on the well-known Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with both transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. In the bootstrap method we solve the LMG model with up to 16 sites. Unlike previous studies that have focused mainly on ground-state properties, our methodology allows for the calculation of a broad range of properties, including energy spectrum, angular momentum, concurrence, tangle, residual tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI), for all eigenstates or a particular sector of the eigenstates, without referring to the explicit wavefunctions of these states. We show that this approach offers not only a new computational methodology but also a comprehensive view of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement properties across the entire spectrum of eigenstates. Specifically, we demonstrate that states typically found in the central region of the spectrum exhibit greater multipartite entanglement, as indicated by larger QFI values, compared to states at the edges of the spectrum. In contrast, concurrence displays the opposite trend. This observed behavior is in line with the monogamy principle governing quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Effective range expansion with a long-range force</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Lin Du, Feng-Kun Guo, Bing Wu</p>
            <p>The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, identified as a long-range force, a scenario encountered in a broad range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Padé approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. This parameterization is versatile and applicable to a broad range of systems with Yukawa-type interactions -- including particle, hadronic, nuclear, cold atom and quantum gas systems. In particular, it should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. M. Begun, M. N. Chernodub, V. A. Goy, A. V. Molochkov</p>
            <p>The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christoph Hotter, Arkadiusz Kosior, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo-Ting Cai, Hai-Dong Li, Wei Chen</p>
            <p>Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a comprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying physical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that the exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be described by a single classical orbit. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Virkki, Maxim Yurkin</p>
            <p>The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power-law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.</p>

            <p>Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</p>

            <h2>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko</p>
            <p>There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</p>

We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</p>

            <p>Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by non-linearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the $nS$, $nP$, and $nD$ series with principal quantum number $n$ as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light--Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess non-trivial position-dependent forces.</p>

Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</p>

            <p>Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, the resulting student NNP achieves up to 106x speedup in inference compared to the teacher NNP, enabling significantly faster and more efficient MD simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Pedro Ribeiro, Stefano Chesi</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum mixtures of moiré excitons have arisen as a platform for realizing novel phases of light and matter. Here, we study moiré polaritons coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate of dark-state excitons confined to a moiré superlattice. We develop a variational approach to analyze the optical response of the system and demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton interactions significantly modify the character of moiré polaritons, leading to sizable energy shifts of the avoided crossing between the principal polariton branches, and the emergence of an additional, stable repulsive-polariton bound state.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on topological phases in monolayer ZnIn2Te4</h2>

            <p>The interplay of Rashba and quantum spin Hall effects in non-centrosymmetric systems presents both challenges and opportunities for spintronic applications. While Rashba spin-orbit coupling can disrupt the quantum spin Hall phase, their coexistence may enable additional spintronic functionalities by coupling spin-momentum locking in the bulk with topologically protected edge states. Using the ZnIn$_2$Te$_4$ monolayer as a case study-a predicted polar two-dimensional topological insulator-we investigate how intrinsic and Rashba spin-orbit coupling compete within a single material. Our results identify key conditions under which sizable Rashba spin splitting can coexist with a stable quantum spin Hall phase, offering guidance for engineering quantum spin Hall insulators with enhanced spintronic capabilities.</p>

            <p>By utilizing the proximity effect, we introduce a platform that exploits ferroelectric switching to modulate spin currents in graphene proximitized by ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ monolayer. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we studied the electronic structure of graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure for twist angles of 0$^{\circ}$ and 17.5$^{\circ}$, considering both ferroelectric polarizations. We discover that switching the ferroelectric polarization reverses the sign of the charge-to-spin conversion coefficients, acting as a chirality switch of the in-plane spin texture in graphene. For the twisted heterostructure, we observed emergence of unconventional radial Rashba field for one ferroelectric polarization direction. Additionally, we demonstrated that the Rashba phase can be directly extracted from the ratio of conversion efficiency coefficients, providing a straightforward approach to characterize the in-plane spin texture in graphene. All the unique features of the studied graphene/In$_2$Se$_3$ heterostructure can be experimentally detected, offering a promising approach for developing advanced spintronic devices with enhanced performance and efficiency.</p>

            <p>The discovery of local-moment magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors down to the single-layer limit has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of two-dimensional (2D) magnets and unleashed their potential for applications in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. The incorporation of strong electronic and magnetic correlations in 2D vdW metals remains a sought-after platform not only to enable control of emergent quantum phases, such as superconductivity, but also to achieve more theoretically tractable microscopic models of complex materials. To date, however, there is limited success in the discovery of such metallic vdW platforms, and $f$-electron monolayers remain out of reach. Here we demonstrate that the actinide $\beta$-UTe$_3$ can be exfoliated to the monolayer limit. A sizable electronic specific heat coefficient provides the hallmark of strong correlations. Remarkably, $\beta$-UTe$_3$ remains ferromagnetic in the half-unit-cell limit with an enhanced ordering temperature of 35 K, a factor of two larger than its bulk counterpart. Our work establishes $\beta$-UTe$_3$ as a novel materials platform for investigating and modeling correlated behavior in the monolayer limit and opens numerous avenues for quantum control with, e.g., strain engineering.</p>

            <h2>Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiming Pan, Chen Lu, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</p>
            <p>Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic $O_h$ symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional $E_g$ representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}+id_{x^2-y^2}$-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as $p_x+ip_y$ (e.g $^3$He-A) and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar $O_{xyz}$ component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges $\pm 1$. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in Deep Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexei V. Tkachenko</p>
            <p>While Landauer's principle sets a fundamental energy limit for irreversible digital computation, we show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented on analog physical substrates can operate under markedly different thermodynamic constraints. We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paulin de Schoulepnikoff, Gorka Muñoz-Gil, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Hans J. Briegel</p>
            <p>Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Liu, Juhao Wu, Mark Ying</p>
            <p>By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</p>

            <h2>Quantum and Semi-Classical Signatures of Dissipative Chaos in the Steady State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Pedro Ribeiro, Stefano Chesi</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.</p>

In Ge-based Josephson junctions, which can be isotopically purified, Andreev states have been experimentally observed but spin-resolved Andreev states remain elusive. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the geometry of the Josephson junction can limit the qubit frequency to values below typical experimental temperatures and render the ASQ effectively invisible. ASQs could be experimentally resolved by judiciously choosing the geometry of the junction and filling of the underlying Ge. Our comprehensive study of ASQ frequency on in situ and ex situ experimentally controllable parameters provides design guidance of Ge-based Josephson junctions and paves the way towards realization of high-coherence ASQs.</p>

            <p>A Chern metal is a two-dimensional metallic state of matter carrying chiral edge states. It can emerge as a doped Chern insulator, but theoretical studies have also predicted its emergence near a Kondo breakdown separating a metallic chiral spin liquid and a heavy Fermi liquid in a frustrated lattice. To date, the latter exotic scenario has not been realized. Here, we report the observation of a Chern metal at the onset of the magnetic Kondo breakdown in a frustrated moiré Kondo lattice--angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. The state is compressible and is manifested by a nearly quantized Hall resistance but a finite longitudinal resistance that arises from a bad metallic bulk. The state also separates an itinerant and a heavy Fermi liquid and appears far away from the band inversion critical point of the material, thus ruling out its origin from simply doping a Chern insulator. We demonstrate the presence of a chiral edge state by nonlocal transport measurements and current-induced quantum anomalous Hall breakdown. Magnetic circular dichroism measurements further reveal a magnetization plateau for the Chern metal before a metamagnetic transition at the Kondo breakdown. Our results open an opportunity for moiré engineering of exotic quantum phases of matter through the close interplay between band topology and Kondo interactions.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.</p>

            <p>Binary ferroelectric nitrides are promising materials for information technologies and power electronics. However, polarization switching in these materials is highly unusual. From the structural perspective, polarization reversal is associated with the change of the effective polarity at the surfaces and interfaces from N-to-M terminated, suggesting strong coupling between ferroelectric and chemical phenomena. Phenomenologically, macroscopic studies demonstrate the presence of complex time dependent phenomena including wake-up. Here, we explore the polarization switching using the multidimensional high-resolution piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy, detecting both the evolution of induced ferroelectric domain, electromechanical response, and surface deformation during first-order reversal curve measurements. We demonstrate the presence of two weakly coupled ferroelectric subsystems and the bias-induced electrochemical reactivity. The observed behaviors are very similar to the recent studies of other wurtzite system but additionally include electrochemical reactivity, suggesting the universality of these behaviors for the wurtzite binary ferroelectrics. These studies suggest potential of high-resolution multimodal PFM spectroscopies to resolve complex coupled polarization dynamics in materials. Furthermore, these PFM based studies are fully consistent with the recent electron microscopy observations of the shark-teeth like ferroelectric domains in nitrides. Hence, we believe that these studies establish the universal phenomenological picture of polarization switching in binary wurtzite.</p>

These simulations require the accurate implementation of motion and entanglement of fermionic particles. Instead of the commonly applied costly mapping to qubits, fermionic quantum computers offer the prospect of directly implementing electronic structure problems. Ultracold neutral atoms have emerged as a powerful platform for spin-based quantum computing, but quantum information can also be processed via the motion of bosonic or fermionic atoms offering a distinct advantage by intrinsically conserving crucial symmetries like electron number. Here we demonstrate collisional entangling gates with fidelities up to 99.75(6)% and lifetimes of Bell states beyond $10\,s$ via the control of fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we characterize both spin-exchange and pair-tunneling gates locally, and realize a robust, composite pair-exchange gate, a key building block for quantum chemistry simulations. Our results enable the preparation of complex quantum states and advanced readout protocols for a new class of scalable analog-digital hybrid quantum simulators. Once combined with local addressing, they mark a key step towards a fully digital fermionic quantum computer based on the controlled motion and entanglement of fermionic neutral atoms.</p>

            <h2>Electron correlations in the kagome flat band metal $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$</h2>

            <p>Kagome metals offer a unique platform for investigating robust electron-correlation effects because of their lattice geometry, flat bands and multi-orbital nature. In the cases with active flat bands, recent theoretical studies have pointed to a rich phase diagram that contains not only electronic orders but also quantum criticality. Very recently, $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$ has emerged as a strong candidate for exploring such new physics. Here, using effective tight-binding models obtained from ab initio calculations, we study the effects of electronic correlations and symmetries on the electronic structure of $\rm CsCr_3 Sb_5$. The effective tight-binding model and Fermi surface comprise multiple Cr-$d$ orbitals and Sb-$p$ orbitals. The introduction of Hubbard-Kanamori interactions leads to orbital-selective band renormalization dominated by the $d_{xz}$ band, concurrently producing emergent flat bands very close to the Fermi level. Our analysis sets the stage for further investigations into the electronic properties of $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$, including electronic orders, quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity, which promise to shed much new light into the electronic materials with frustrated lattices and bring about new connections with the correlation physics of a variety of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shantonu Mukherjee, Amitabha Lahiri</p>
            <p>The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a topological structure: namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a Néel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Strong Field Optical Hall Effect in 2D Weyl Semimetal</h2>

            <p>The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and transverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.</p>

            <h2>Giant orbital Hall effect due to the bulk states of 3D topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James H. Cullen, Hong Liu, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>The highly efficient torques generated by 3D topological insulators make them a favourable platform for faster and more efficient magnetic memory devices. Recently, research into harnessing orbital angular momentum in orbital torques has received significant attention. Here we study the orbital Hall effect in topological insulators. We find that the bulk states give rise to a sizeable orbital Hall effect that is up to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the spin Hall effect in topological insulators. This is partially because the orbital angular momentum that each conduction electron carries is up to an order of magnitude larger than the $\hbar/2$ carried by its spin. Our results imply that the large torques measured in topological insulator/ferromagnet devices can be further enhanced through careful engineering of the heterostructure to optimise orbital-to-spin conversion.</p>

            <h2>Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Keyu Zeng, Ziqiang Wang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120°, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Citeroni, Marco Polini, Michael Dapolito, D. N. Basov, Giacomo Mazza</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of quantum matter interacting with time-energy entangled photons. We consider the stimulation of a collective mode of a two-dimensional material by means of one of the two partners of a time-energy entangled pair of photons. Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Stepp, Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, Richard T. Scalettar, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>Recent advances in microwave shielding have increased the stability and control of large numbers of polar molecules, allowing for the first realization of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishing features of longitudinal magnetoconductivity for a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>The band-degeneracy points in the Brillouin zones of chiral crystals exist in multiple avatars, with the high-symmetry points being able to host multifold nodes of distinct characters. A class of such crystals, assisted by the spin-orbit coupling, harbours fourfold degeneracy in the form of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node (RSWN) at the $\Gamma$-point. Our aim is to explore the nature of longitudinal magnetoconductivity, arising from applying collinear electric and magnetic fields, for such systems. Adjusting the chemical potential to lie near the intrinsic energy-location of the RSWN, the multifold nature of the RSWN is revealed by an interplay of intraband and interband scatterings, which would not arise in twofold degeneracies like the conventional Weyl nodes. The current study fills up the much-needed gap in obtaining the linear response from an exact computation, rather than the insufficient relaxation-time approximation employed earlier.</p>

            <p>Non-centrosymmetric superconductors have emerged as a fascinating avenue for exploring unconventional superconductivity. Their broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries make them prime candidates for realizing the intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE). In this work, we synthesize the ternary non-centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$ and conduct a comprehensive investigation of its superconducting properties through resistivity, magnetization, specific heat and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques. Our transverse field-$\mu$SR and specific heat results provide evidence of a moderately coupled, fully-gaped superconducting state. Zero field-$\mu$SR measurements reveal a subtle increase in the relaxation rate below the transition temperature, suggesting time reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting ground state of NbTaOs$_{2}$.</p>

            <h2>Defect-Mediated Pairing and Dissociation of Strongly Correlated Electrons in Low Dimensional Lattices: The Quantum Taxi Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Pouthier, Saad Yalouz</p>
            <p>We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \sim V \sim \Delta) \gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Exciton condensation of composite fermions in double layer quantum Hall systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang-Jian Hou, Lei Wang, Ying-Hai Wu</p>
            <p>We study fractional quantum Hall states in double layer systems that can be interpreted as exciton condensates of composite fermions. An electron in one layer is dressed by two fluxes from the same layer and two fluxes from the other layer to become composite fermions that form effective Landau levels. It is found that two types of composite fermion exciton condensates could occur. In the first type ones, all effective levels are partially occupied and excitonic correlations are present between composite fermions in the same effective level. In the second type ones, composite fermions in the topmost effective levels of the two layers form exciton condensate whereas those in lower effective levels are independent. The electric transport signatures of these states are analyzed. We demonstrate using numerical calculations that some composite fermion exciton condensates can be realized in microscopic models that are relevant for graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. For a fixed total filling factor, an exciton condensate may only be realized when the electron densities in the two layers belong to a certain range. It is possible that two types of states appear at the same total filling factor in different ranges. These results shed light on recent experimental observations and also suggest some promising future directions.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have observed signatures of spin-valley-polarized unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$). Here, we explore the rich physics of superconducting tMoTe$_2$, enabled by its unique layer-pseudospin structure. Within a minimal two-orbital layer-pseudospin model framework, both interlayer and intralayer Cooper pairings can be effectively visualized using a layer-space Bloch sphere representation. Remarkably, we find that interlayer pairing prevails in the spin-valley-polarized state, whereas intralayer pairing dominates in the spin-valley-unpolarized state. Strikingly, we further predict that for spin-valley-polarized intravalley superconducting state, experimentally feasible weak displacement fields can stabilize finite-momentum pairings at low temperatures. Additionally, in-plane magnetic fields, which break three-fold rotational symmetry, induce field-direction-dependent finite-momentum pairing states, leading to a versatile momentum-selection phase diagram. Our work highlights the crucial role of layer pseudospin in tMoTe$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and demonstrates its unique tunability via external fields.</p>

            <h2>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Sharma, Srikanth Sastry, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.</p>

            <p>Materials possessing long range ordering of magnetic spins or electric dipoles have been the focus of condensed matter research. Among them, ferri-systems with two sublattices of unequal/noncollinear spins or electric dipoles are expected to combine the properties of ferro- and antiferro-systems, but lack experimental observations in single phase materials. This is particularly true for the ferrielectric system, since the electric dipoles usually can be redefined to incorporate the two sublattices into one, making it indistinguishable from ferroelectric. This raises doubts about whether or not ferrielectricity can be considered as an independent ferroic order. Here we report the observation of true ferrielectric behaviors in a hybrid single crystal (MV)[SbBr5] (MV2+ = N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium or methylviologen), where the two electric dipole sublattices switch asynchronously, thus cannot be reduced to ferroelectric by redefining the unit cell. Furthermore, the complex dipole configuration imparts circularly polarized light sensitivity to the system. An electric field can modulate the non-collinear dipole sublattices and even induce a transition from ferrielectric to ferroelectric state, thereby tuning the helicity-dependent photocurrent. This study opens a new paradigm for the study of true irreducible ferrielectricity (a new class of polar system) and provides an effective approach to the electric field control of spin-orbit coupling and circular photogalvanic effect.</p>

However, state-of-the-art chemical exfoliation methods require > 48 hours to produce milligrams of metallic 2D MoS2. Further, chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets are a mixture of metallic (1T or 1T prime 50% to 70%) and semiconducting (2H 30% to 50%) phases. Here, we demonstrate large-scale and rapid (>600 grams per hour) production of purely metallic phase 2D MoS2 (and WS2, MoSe2) nanosheets using microwave irradiation. Atomic resolution imaging shows 1T or 1T prime metallic phase in basal plane - consistent with close to 100% metallic phase concentration measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high 1T phase concentration results in the highest exchange current density of 0.175 plus-minus 0.03 mA cm-2 and among the lowest Tafel slopes (39 - 43 mV dec-1) measured to date for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengtao Huang, Ben Xu</p>
            <p>Accurate atomic-scale simulations of magnetic materials require precise handling of coupled spin-lattice degrees of freedom. Traditional spin-lattice dynamics (SLD), employing Newtonian equation for lattice evolution and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for spins, encounters severe limitations with machine-learning potentials, including poor energy conservation and excessive computational costs due to non-symplectic integration. In this work, we propose TSPIN, a unified Nosé-Hoover Chain-based method overcoming these issues. By extending the classical Lagrangian with explicit spin kinetic terms and thermostat variables, we derive symplectic Hamiltonian formulations suitable for NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles. The method integrates spin and lattice dynamics simultaneously, ensuring robust energy conservation and significantly reducing computational cost. Benchmarks against analytical harmonic spin-lattice models confirm its accuracy, and application to FCC iron using a DeepSPIN MLP demonstrates superior numerical stability and near-linear computational scaling compared to the conventional LLG method. Thus, TSPIN provides a powerful, broadly applicable framework for efficiently simulating complex spin-lattice phenomena and multi-degree-of-freedom systems at large scales.</p>

Based on this evaluation, an all-solid-state built-in Maxwell's demon operating at room temperature is also proposed. Probabilistic behavior has gained attention for its potential to enable unconventional computing paradigms. However, information propagation and computation in such systems are more complex than in conventional computers, making their visualization essential. In this study, a two-skyrmion system confined within a square potential well at thermal equilibrium was analyzed using information thermodynamics. Transfer entropy and the time derivative of mutual information were employed to investigate the information propagation speed, the absence of a Maxwell's demon in thermal equilibrium, and the system's non-Markovian properties. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the system exhibits a small but finite computational capability for the nonlinear XOR operation, potentially linked to hidden information in the non-Markovian system. Based on these experiments and analyses, an all-solid-state built-in Maxwell's demon utilizing the two-skyrmion system and operating at room temperature is proposed.</p>

            <p>High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a rapidly growing class of compositionally complex ceramics in which configurational disorder is engineered to unlock novel functionality. While average crystallographic symmetry is often retained, local structural and chemical disorder, including cation size and valence mismatch, oxygen sublattice distortions, and site-specific bonding, strongly governs ionic transport, redox behavior, magnetic ordering, and dielectric response. This review outlines how these modes of disorder manifest across key oxide families such as rock salt, spinel, fluorite, and perovskite. We highlight recent advances in spectroscopy, total scattering, and high-resolution microscopy enable multi-scale insight into short- and intermediate-range order. By integrating experimental observations with theoretical modeling of entropy and local energetics, we establish a framework linking structural heterogeneity to emergent properties. These insights not only deepen our fundamental understanding of disorder-property relationships but also offer a path toward rational design of tunable materials for catalysis, energy storage, electronics, and much more.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Contreras-Payares, Pablo G. Lustemberg, M. Verónica Ganduglia-Pirovano</p>
            <p>The vibrational frequency of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on ceria-based catalysts serves as a sensitive probe for identifying exposed surface facets, provided that experimental reference data on well-defined single-crystal surfaces and reliable theoretical assignments are available. Previous studies have shown that the hybrid DFT approach using the HSE06 functional yields good agreement with experimental observations, whereas the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE+U does not. In this work, we assess the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals by comparing the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals with HSE06 in predicting CO vibrational frequencies on cerium oxide surfaces. The meta-GGA functionals offer no significant improvement for oxidized CeO2(111) and CeO2(110) surfaces and fail to localize excess charge on the reduced surfaces. Adding a Hubbard U term improves charge localization, but the predicted vibrational frequencies still fall short of HSE06 accuracy. These limitations are attributed to the meta-GGA's inability to adequately capture facet- and configuration-specific donation and back-donation effects, which influence the C-O bond length and CO force constant upon adsorption. Despite the higher computational cost when used with plane-wave basis sets, hybrid DFT remains essential for accurate interpretation of experimental results.</p>

Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Fragmentation of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. E. Alon, L. S. Cederbaum</p>
            <p>We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of mass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{11}$, $\lambda_{22}$, and $\lambda_{33}$, and the interspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{12}$, $\lambda_{13}$, and $\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the generic multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable. We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the multiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra J. Hardy, Samuel Cameron, Steven McDonald, Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Musacchio, Alexander P. Antonov, Hartmut Löwen, Lorenzo Caprini</p>
            <p>We study a two-dimensional crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment. This mechanism induces a torque that aligns a particle's orientation with its velocity and leads to a phase transition from a disordered to a flocking crystal. Here, we provide the first microscopic theory that analytically maps the crystal dynamics onto a Landau-Ginzburg model, in which the velocity-dependent effective free energy undergoes a transition from a single-well shape to a Mexican-hat profile. As confirmed by simulations, our theory quantitatively predicts the transition point and characteristic spatial velocity correlations. The continuous change of the order parameter and the diverging behavior of the analytically predicted correlation length imply that flocking in self-aligning active crystals is a second-order phase transition. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the flocking phenomenon observed experimentally in active granular particles and migrating cells.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle Properties of Long-Range Impurities in a Bose Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Alper Yoğurt, Matthew T. Eiles</p>
            <p>An impurity immersed in a Bose condensate can form a quasiparticle known as a Bose polaron. When the impurity-boson interaction is short-ranged, the quasiparticle's properties are universal, characterized - independent of the bath density $n_0$ - by the impurity-boson scattering length $a_{IB}$. Long-ranged interactions - such as provided by Rydberg or ionic impurities - introduce an effective interaction range $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and boson-boson interactions provide a third length scale, the condensate coherence length $\xi $. These competing length scales raise the question of whether a universal description remains valid across different bath densities. In this study, we discuss the quasiparticle nature of long-range impurities and its dependence on the length scales $ n_0^{-1/3} $, $ r_{\mathrm{eff}} $, and $ \xi $. We employ two complementary theories - the coherent state Ansatz and the perturbative Gross-Pitaevskii theory - which incorporate beyond-Fröhlich interactions. We derive an analytical expression for the beyond-Fröhlich effective mass for a contact interaction and numerically compute the effective mass for long-range impurities. We argue that the coupling parameter $ |a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} $ remains the principal parameter governing the properties of the polaron. For weak $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \ll 1) $ and intermediate $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \simeq 1) $ values of the coupling parameter, long-range impurities in a BEC are well-described as quasiparticles with a finite quasiparticle weight and a well-defined effective mass. However, the quasiparticle weight becomes significantly suppressed as the effective impurity volume is occupied by an increasing number of bath particles $ (r_{\mathrm{eff}} n_0^{1/3} \gg 1) $.</p>

            <p>Quantum metrology based on Josephson junction array reproduces the most accurate desired voltage by far, therefore being introduced to provide voltage standards worldwide. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the dependence of the first Shapiro step height of the junction array at 50 GHz on the parameter spread of 10,000 Josephson junctions by numerical simulation with resistively shunted junction model. The results indicate an upper limit spread of the critical current and resistance of the Josephson junctions. Specifically, to keep the maximum first Shapiro step above 0.88 mA, the critical current standard deviation, $\sigma$, should not exceed 25%, and for it to stay above 0.6 mA, the resistance standard deviation should not exceed 1.5%.</p>

            <p>Lieb and Kagome lattices exhibit two-dimensional topological insulator behavior with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification when considering spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we used a general tight-binding Hamiltonian with a morphological control parameter $\theta$ to describe the Lieb ($\theta=\pi/2$), Kagome ($\theta=2\pi/3$), and transition lattices ($\pi/2<\theta<2\pi/3$) while considering intrinsic spin-orbit (ISO) coupling. We systematically investigated the effects of shear and uniaxial strains, applied along different crystallographic directions, on the electronic spectrum of these structures. Our findings reveal that these deformations can induce topological phase transitions by modifying the structural lattice angle associated with the interconversibility process between Lieb and Kagome, the amplitude of the strain, and the magnitude of the ISO coupling. These transitions are confirmed by the evolution of Berry curvature and by changes in the Chern number when the gap closes. Additionally, by analyzing hypothetical strain scenarios in which the hopping and ISO coupling parameters remain intentionally unchanged, our results demonstrated that the strain-induced phase transitions arise from changes in the hopping and ISO coupling parameters.</p>

            <p>Clay minerals are non-spherical nano-scale particles that usually form flocculated, house-of-card like structures under the influence of inter-molecular forces. Numerical modeling of clays is still in its infancy as the required inter-particle forces are available only for spherical particles. A polytope approach would allow shape-accurate forces and torques while simultaneously being more performant. The Anandarajah solution provides an analytical formulation for van der Waals forces for cuboid particles but in its original form is not suitable for implementation in DEM simulations. In this work, we discuss the necessary changes for a functional implementation of the Anandarajah solution in a DEM simulation of rectangular particles and their extension to cuboid particles.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.</p>

            <h2>First-passage and extreme value statistics for overdamped Brownian motion in a linear potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Huang, Hanshuang Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate the first-passage properties and extreme-value statistics of an overdamped Brownian particle confined by an external linear potential $V(x)=\mu |x-x_0|$, where $\mu>0$ is the strength of the potential and $x_0>0$ is the position of the lowest point of the potential, which coincides with the starting position of the particle. The Brownian motion terminates whenever the particle passes through the origin at a random time $t_f$. Our study reveals that the mean first-passage time $\langle t_f \rangle$ exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with respect to $\mu$, with a unique minimum occurring at an optimal value of $\mu \simeq 1.24468D/x_0$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant of the Brownian particle. Moreover, we examine the distribution $P(M|x_0)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ during the first-passage process, as well as the statistics of the time $t_m$ at which $M$ is reached. Intriguingly, there exists another optimal $\mu \simeq 1.24011 D/x_0$ that minimizes the mean time $\langle t_m \rangle$. All our analytical findings are corroborated through numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits glassy behavior, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through this glassy phase. These findings provide insights into nonequilibrium phase transitions in active matter, revealing a robust glassy phase en route to solidification, and may guide future studies in both synthetic and biological active systems.</p>

            <p>Recently, tensor gauge fields and their coupling to fracton phases of matter have attracted more and more research interest, and a series of novel quantum phenomena arising from the coupling has been predicted. In this article, we propose a theoretical scheme to construct a time-dependent rank-2 tensor electric field by introducing a periodically driving quadratic potential in a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, and investigate the dynamics of dipole and fracton excitations when the drive frequency is resonant with the on-site interaction. We find that the dynamics are dominated by the splitting of large dipoles with the photon-assisted correlated tunneling and the movement of small dipoles, both of which can be well controlled by the drive amplitude. Our work provides a possible approach for engineering the dynamics of dipole-conserving quantum systems via tensor gauge fields.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen bond symmetrization is a fundamental pressure-induced transformation in which the distinction between donor and acceptor sites vanishes, resulting in a symmetric hydrogen-bond network. While extensively studied in pure ice, most notably during the ice VII to ice X transition, this phenomenon remains less well characterized in hydrogen hydrates. In this work, we investigate hydrogen bond symmetrization in the high-pressure phases of hydrogen hydrate (H2-H2O and H2-D2O) through a combined approach of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles quantum atomistic simulations. We focus on the C2 and C3 filled-ice phases, using both hydrogenated and deuterated water frameworks. Our results reveal that quantum fluctuations and the interaction between the encaged H2 molecules and the host lattice play a crucial role in driving the symmetrization process. Remarkably, we find that in both C2 and C3 phases, hydrogen bond symmetrization occurs via a continuous crossover at significantly lower pressures than in pure ice, without any change in the overall crystal symmetry. These findings provide new insight into the quantum-driven mechanisms of bond symmetrization in complex hydrogen-bonded systems under extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>We present an ab initio method to calculate the clamped Pockels tensor of ferroelectric materials from density-functional theory, the modern theory of polarization exploiting the electric-enthalpy functional, and automated first- and second-order finite-difference derivatives of the polarizations and the Hellmann-Feynman forces. Thanks to the functional-independent capabilities of our approach, we can determine the Pockels tensor of tetragonal barium titanate (BTO) beyond the local density approximation (LDA), with arbitrary exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, for example, PBEsol. The latter, together with RRKJ ultra-soft pseudo-potentials (PP) and a supercell exhibiting local titanium off-centering, enables us to stabilize the negative optical phonon modes encountered in tetragonal BTO when LDA and norm-conserving PP are combined. As a result, the correct value range of $r_{51}$, the largest experimental Pockels coefficient of BTO, is recovered. We also reveal that $r_{51}$ increases with decreasing titanium off-centering for this material. The lessons learned from the structural, dielectric, and vibrational investigations of BTO will be essential to design next-generation electro-optical modulators based on the Pockels effect.</p>

            <p>3D printing has revolutionized numerous scientific fields and industries, with printing in biological systems emerging as a rapidly advancing area of research. However, its application to the subcellular level remains largely unexplored.

A biocompatible photoresist is injected into live cells and selectively polymerized with a femtosecond laser. The unpolymerized photoresist is dissolved naturally within the cytoplasm, leaving behind stable intracellular structures with submicron resolution within live cells. We printed various shapes, including a $10 \mu m$ elephant, barcodes for cell tracking, diffraction gratings for remote readout, and microlasers. Our top-down intracellular biofabrication approach, combined with existing functional photoresists, could open new avenues for various applications, including intracellular sensing, biomechanical manipulation, bioelectronics, and targeted intracellular drug delivery. Moreover, these embedded structures could offer unprecedented control over the intracellular environment, enabling the engineering of cellular properties beyond those found in nature.</p>

This structural integrity under compression is related to an enhanced mechanical resilience of PT-AuNPs, despite exhibiting bulk moduli comparable to those of SC-AuNPs. Notwithstanding, comparable pressure-induced localized surface plasmon resonance redshifts - for all nanoparticle geometries - were observed. Our analysis indicates that these shifts are primarily caused by changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium, with electron density compression playing a minor role, contrasting with the behavior in SC-AuNPs, where electron density compression has a greater influence.</p>

            <p>We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic scalar field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for estimating material parameters in solar cells. Traditional methods for parameter extraction often rely on time-consuming numerical simulations that fail to capture the full complexity of the parameter space and discard valuable information from suboptimal simulations. In this study, we introduce a novel workflow for parameter estimation in organic solar cells based on a combination of numerical simulations and neural networks. The workflow begins with the selection of an appropriate experimental dataset, followed by the definition of a device model that accurately describes the experiment. To reduce computational complexity, the number of variable parameters is carefully selected, and reasonable ranges are set for each parameter. Instead of directly fitting the experimental data using a numerical model, a neural network was trained on a large dataset of simulated results, allowing for efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space. This approach not only accelerates the parameter estimation process but also provides valuable insights into the likelihood and uncertainty of the estimated parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on organic solar cells based on the PBDB-TF-T1:BTP-4F-12 material system, demonstrating the potential of machine learning for rapid and comprehensive characterization of emerging photovoltaic materials.</p>

            <p>Using numerical simulations, we study the rheological response of dense non-Brownian suspensions containing active particles. The active particles are modelled as run-and-tumble particles with three controlling parameters: the fraction of active particles in the system, an active force applied to the particles, and a persistence time after which the direction of the active force changes randomly. Our simulations reveal that the presence of activity can reduce the viscosity (by an order of magnitude) by decreasing the number of frictional contacts, which also shifts the jamming point to a higher volume fraction. Moreover, the microscopic structure of force chains in the presence of activity is qualitatively different from that in the passive system, showing reduced anisotropy. We also find that while the presence of activity drives the system away from jamming by preventing the formation of force chains, unjamming an already jammed state by breaking existing force chains requires a higher activity strength. Finally, we propose a new constitutive law to describe the rheology of dense active non-Brownian suspensions.</p>

            <p>The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</p>

            <p>A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the lack of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\ Phys.\ Soc.\ Jpn.\ \textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling.</p>

In this study, we investigate the electron-induced switching of [Fe(H$_2$B(pz)(pypz))$_2$] (pz = pyrazole, pypz = pyridylpyrazole) adsorbed on Ag(111). The current time traces show transitions between two current levels corresponding to the two spin states. We extract switching rates from these traces by analyzing waiting-time distributions. Their sample-voltage dependence can be explained within a simple model in which the switching is triggered by a transient charging of the molecule. The comparison between experimental data and theoretical modeling provides estimates for the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, which were so far experimentally inaccessible. Overall, our approach offers new insights into the electron-induced switching mechanism and predicts enhanced switching rates upon electronic decoupling of the molecule from the metallic substrate, for example by introducing an ultrathin insulating layer.</p>

            <h2>Uncovering the nanoscopic phase behavior of ternary solutions in the presence of electrolytes: from pre-Ouzo to Ouzo region</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingbo Li, Rushi Lai, Yadi Tian, Yawen Gao, Benlong Wang, Chao Sun</p>
            <p>In this work, we report a comprehensive study of how electrolyte addition governs the structure and stability of surfactant-free microemulsions in a trans-anethol/ethanol/water system. The universal structural response has been validated, spanning the full range of solution dispersed-phase structurings, from sub-10 nm W/O reverse-aggregates to O/W mesoscopic droplets (~100 nm) and classical Ouzo droplets (~1 {\mu}m). Experimental results reveal that there is a threshold for electrolyte levels above which oil-in-water nanodroplet coalescence and phase separation are triggered: screening of electrical double layers and "salting out" of hydrophobic components drives hydrotrope into fewer, larger droplets. The total oil volume sequestered in the dispersed phase remains essentially constant, indicating oil redistribution rather than dissolution. In contrast, water-in-oil nanodroplets in a predominantly organic medium display near-complete insensitivity to ionic strength, owing to low dielectric screening and tight interfacial packing that exclude substantial ion uptake. Finally, addition of high salt to Ouzo droplets accelerates their collapse: large droplets fuse and sediment, leaving only residual nanostructures and confirming electrolyte-driven phase demixing. This insight offers clear guidelines for designing additive-free emulsions with tailored lifetimes and nanostructure architectures across pharmaceutical, food, and materials applications.</p>

            <p>Layered magnetic materials potentially hold the key to future applications based on optical control and manipulation of magnetism. NiPS3, a prototype member of this family, is antiferromagnetic below 155 K and exhibits sharp photoluminescence associated to a transition between a triplet ground state and a singlet excited state. The nature of the luminescent transition is a matter of current debate and so is an eventual fundamental link of this excitation to magnetism. Here we provide answers through experiments and calculations. We fabricate samples with metal and ligand substitutions which alter the Neel transition temperature and measure the effects of these changes on the temperature dependent photoluminescence. We perform crystal field and charge transfer multiplet calculations to explain the origin of the excitation and identify the effects of the magnetic ground state on its properties. These measurements and calculations provide a comprehensive explanation for the observed properties and a template for finding similar materials exhibiting spin-flip luminescence.</p>

            <h2>Role of topotactic hydrogen in Superconductivity of Infinite-layer Nickelate NdNiO$_{2}$: A first-principles and variational Monte Carlo study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manoj Gupta, Arun Kumar Maurya, Amal Medhi, Tanusri Saha Dasgupta</p>
            <p>Employing combination of first-principles calculations, low-energy model construction, and variational Monte Carlo solution of the ab-initio derived Hubbard model, we study the effect of hydrogenation in the electronic structure and superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelate, NdNiO$_2$. We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.</p>

            <p>Photocatalytic water splitting offers a viable and sustainable method for hydrogen production. MXenes, a class of 2D transition-metal carbides/nitrides, have emerged as potential photocatalysts and co-catalysts due to their tunable electronic properties, high conductivity, and surface functionality. This review explores recent advances in MXene-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production, discussing their synthesis, electronic structures, and photocatalytic mechanisms. The key challenges, including stability issues, charge recombination, and bandgap optimisation, are critically analysed.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Bulakhov, A. S. Peletminskii</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an interacting Bose gas with a condensate within the energy-functional formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. For a contact interaction, we derive a self-consistent solution to the HFB equations that intrinsically eliminates divergence. This solution characterizes the equilibrium state featuring a condensate of correlated pairs of particles. We analyze the temperature dependence of key thermodynamic quantities such as condensate density, chemical potential, entropy, pressure, specific heat capacity at constant volume, and isothermal compressibility and compare them with predictions from the Popov approximation. Our results reveal a first-order phase transition between the normal state and the degenerate state, accompanied by an increased transition temperature relative to the ideal Bose gas. Analysis of the compressibility indicates that a pure pair condensate is unstable, and the stable equilibrium corresponds to a mixture of single-particle and pair condensates.</p>

            <p>This study underscores the pivotal role of sodium (Na) supply in optimizing the optoelectronic properties of wide bandgap (~1.6 eV) Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) thin film absorbers for high efficiency solar cells. Our findings demonstrate that the synergistic use of Na from the glass substrate, in conjunction with in-situ sodium fluoride (NaF) co-evaporation, significantly enhances the structural and optoelectronic properties of the CIGS. CIGS grown under either Na-deficient or excess conditions exhibits inferior microstructural and optoelectronic properties, whereas an optimal Na supply leads to enhanced photovoltaic performance. Optimal Na incorporation minimizes vertical gallium fluctuations and improves the grain size and crystallinity. An absolute 1 sun calibrated photoluminescence (PL) measurement reveals a substantial suppression of bulk defects and a reduction in non-radiative losses, resulting in a high quasi-fermi level splitting ({\Delta}EF) of 1.07 eV, 93 meV higher than in Na-deficient CIGS with the same bandgap. Optimal Na supply further increases excited carrier decay time, as revealed from time-resolved PL, and hole doping density. Cross-sectional hyperspectral cathodoluminescence mapping reveals that optimal Na supply significantly reduces defect density near the surface, thereby effectively translating {\Delta}EF to open-circuit voltage (VOC). As a result, a champion wide bandgap CIGS solar cell with a cadmium-free ZnSnO buffer layer achieved an impressive VOC of 971 meV and an active area power conversion efficiency of 15.7%, highlighting its potential for advancing tandem photovoltaic technologies with stable inorganic top cell.</p>

            <h2>Excitations and dynamical structure factor of $J_1-J_2$ spin-$3/2$ and spin-$5/2$ Heisenberg spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Natalia Chepiga, Frédéric Mila</p>
            <p>We study the dynamical structure factor of the frustrated spin-$3/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chains, with particular focus on the partially dimerized phase that emerges between two Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.</p>

            <h2>From Brittle to Ductile and Back: Reentrant Fracture Transition in Disordered Two-Phase Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subrat Senapati, Anuradha Banerjee, R Rajesh</p>
            <p>Fracture processes in multi-phase solids are inherently complex due to multiple competing mechanisms. Here, we investigate the elastic and fracture behaviour of two-phase solids, comprising a fragile phase and a tough phase using a disordered spring network model. The macroscopic response is found to depend on the failure strain mismatch, the elastic modulus ratio, as well as the relative composition of the constituent phases. As the proportion of the tough phase increases, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition in fracture behaviour: from brittle to ductile-like and back to brittle. These transitions are identified through both avalanche statistics and cluster size characteristics of broken springs. Notably, the avalanche exponent associated with the majority phase changes universality class during the brittle to ductile transition. Analysis of time evolution of cluster characteristics reveals distinct growth mechanisms in the two regimes. In the brittle regime, dominant clusters rapidly absorb other large clusters, keeping the total number of clusters nearly constant. In contrast, the ductile regime is characterised by more gradual coalescence, leading to a decrease in the total number of clusters over time while their average size increases. We provide a physical interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the observed switch in fracture behaviour.</p>

            <h2>Electronic Correlations Control Interlayer Coupling and Magnetic Transition in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/MnBr$_3$ Heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanhao Zhu, Xixi Yuan, Ying Zhao, Jin Zhang, Zijing Ding, Huixia Fu</p>
            <p>Bulk MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. However, its low Néel temperature of $\sim 25\,\mathrm{K}$ severely restricts its practical applications. Here, we propose a van der Waals heterostructure composed of monolayer MBT (ML-MBT) and monolayer MnBr$_3$, an intrinsic Chern insulator possessing a high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C} \sim 200\,\mathrm{K}$). By employing density functional theory calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that interfacing ML-MBT with MnBr$_3$ significantly enhances the $T_\mathrm{C}$ of ML-MBT by a factor of four to five. Electronic correlations characterized by the Hubbard parameter $U_2$ for Mn-$d$ orbitals in MnBr$_3$ play a crucial role in governing magnetic coupling within the system. At a moderate correlation strength of $U_2 = 3.0\,\mathrm{eV}$, slight structural distortions in MnBr$_3$ break intralayer symmetry, enabling robust interlayer ferromagnetic coupling and yielding a single, unified magnetic transition. Increasing $U_2$ reduces these structural distortions, weakens interlayer coupling, and induces two distinct magnetic transitions, indicating interlayer magnetic decoupling. Thus, the MBT/MnBr$_3$ heterostructure offers a novel approach for controlling magnetic order and enhancing the performance of spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>In this study, we employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the GGA+U framework to explore the electronic and magnetic properties of CrSb2 under varying hydrostatic pressures. CrSb2 exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of around 0.5 eV around the Fermi level and the d-wave symmetric Fermi surface. Our magnetic susceptibility measurements further confirm the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in CrSb2 , a prerequisite for altermagnetism. The presence of collinear AFM and spin-band splitting without the application of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) supports CrSb2 as a potential contender for altermagnet. With increasing pressure, we have observed an intricate evolution of spin splitting in the valence and conduction bands, governed by changes in orbital contributions. The observation of the structural phase transition above 10 GPa is in qualitative agreement with the previous experimental findings. Our results not only support the classification of CrSb2 as an altermagnetic candidate but also provide critical insight into the role of pressure in tuning its spin-dependent electronic structure.</p>

            <p>Detecting topological phase transitions in bulk is challenging due to the limitations of surface sensitive probes like ARPES. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear bulk photocurrents, specifically shift and injection currents, serve as effective probes of Z_2 topological transitions. These photocurrents show a robust polarity reversal across the Z_2 phase transition, offering a direct optical signature that distinguishes strong topological phases from weak or trivial ones. This effect originates from a reorganization of key band geometric quantities, the Berry curvature and shift vector, on time-reversal-invariant momentum planes. Using a low energy Dirac model, we trace this behaviour to a band inversion in the time-reversal-invariant momentum plane that drives the topological transition. We validate these findings through tight-binding model for Bi_2Te_3 and first-principles calculations for ZrTe_5 and BiTeI, where the topological phase can be tuned by pressure or temperature. Our results establish nonlinear photocurrent as a sensitive and broadly applicable probe of Z_2 topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films were grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition with various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) targeted at 5 at % to investigate how such doping influences their structure and properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the actual dopant incorporation is well below the nominal 5 %, with only Al and Sc present above detection. An off-stoichiometric Cu-Cr-O composition is determined, with no secondary phases detected. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that films grown on c-plane sapphire are epitaxial near the substrate interface but relax into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon are polycrystalline throughout. All films show high p-type conductivity (on the order of 10-10^2 Scm-1) attributable to the excess oxygen, with no significant variation among different dopants. Optical transmission measurements indicate a slight red-shift (~20 nm) of the absorption edge for all doped films, likely arising from strain effects and subtle structural disorder introduced during growth. We discuss the influence of lattice strain (investigated by X-ray diffraction sin {\psi} squared measurements showing residual strain) and small polaron absorption behavior in these films. Despite limited incorporation of dopants, subtle structural and optical shifts suggest that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions play a significant role in influencing film stoichiometry and properties.</p>

            <p>Grain boundaries facet due to anisotropic grain boundary energies: While the faceted boundary has a larger area than the corresponding straight boundary, a significantly lower energy of the facets compared to a straight segment can drive the faceting. This picture is complicated by faceting/defaceting transitions where the free energy difference between the two states depends on the temperature. Here, we use atomistic computer simulations to show how such a transition in a $\Sigma 3$ $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt grain boundary in Al is in fact a grain boundary phase transition (also called complexion transition). This means that the faceted and defaceted boundaries are associated with different atomic structures, which have different thermodynamic stability ranges. At low temperatures, the grain boundary phase associated with faceting is stable, while at high temperatures the flat grain boundary phase is stable. We also report on our thorough tests of Al interatomic potentials for this purpose, which include comparisons to density-functional theory calculations. Our chosen potential performs well for our grain boundaries. As a consequence we were able to obtain results that align with previous experimental results.</p>

            <p>We revisit the stability of the superconducting state within mean-field theory in the presence of repulsive pairing interactions, focusing on multiband systems where such channels naturally arise. We show that, when repulsion is present, the self-consistent BCS solution appears as a saddle point of the conventional mean-field free energy, casting doubt on its physical stability. We show that this pathology is an artifact of using a non-variational functional. Recasting the problem with Bogoliubov's variational principle restores a free energy that is bounded from below and places the BCS solution at a genuine minimum. Using a two-band toy model relevant to iron-based superconductors, we demonstrate the stability of the s$_\pm$ state and clarify how projection schemes that rely only on the interaction matrix can misidentify the attractive eigenmode that drives pairing. Our results clarify the instability issue highlighted by Aase et al. and provide a consistent foundation for analyzing fluctuations in the presence of repulsive interactions.</p>

            <p>We investigate finite-size topological phases in thin films of nodal line semimetals (co-dimension 2) in three dimensions. By analyzing the hybridization of drumhead surface states, we demonstrate that such systems can transition into either a lower-dimensional nodal line state (co-dimension 1) or a fully gapped trivial phase. Additionally, we explore the hybridization of bulk states along the nodal loop when the system is finite in directions parallel to the loop's plane. This generally results in a topologically nontrivial gap. In films finite along a single in-plane direction, a partial gap opens, giving rise to two-dimensional Weyl cones characterized by a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant. When the system is finite along both in-plane directions, a fully gapped phase appears, distinguished by a $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant whose value increases with film thickness. We further discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence associated with these emergent topological phases.</p>

            <p>Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</p>

However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems.

Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauryn Kortman, Alexis Devitre, Charles Hirst</p>
            <p>Over the lifetime of a fusion power plant, irradiation-induced defects will accumulate in the superconducting magnets compromising their ability to carry current without losses, generate high magnetic fields, and thus maintain plasma confinement. These defects also store potential energy within the crystalline lattice of materials, which can be released upon annealing. This phenomenon raises the question of whether the energy stored in defects may be sufficient to accelerate, or even trigger, a magnet quench? To provide an order of magnitude estimate, we used molecular dynamics simulations to generate defected YBCO supercells and conduct isothermal annealing simulations. Our results reveal that the maximum volumetric stored energy in a 4 mDPA defected single crystal of YBCO (240 $J/cm^3$) is 30 times greater than the experimental minimum quench energy values for YBCO tapes (8.1 $J/cm^3$). Our simulations also show that the amount of energy released increases as a function of annealing temperature or irradiation dose. This trend demonstrates that localized heating events in an irradiated fusion magnet have the potential to release significant amounts of defect energy. These findings underscore the critical need for experimental validation of the accumulation and release of defect stored energy, and highlight the importance of incorporating this contribution into quench detection systems, to enhance the operational safety of large-scale YBCO fusion magnets.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Superfluid Density in Pair-Density-Wave Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Wang, Qijin Chen, Rufus Boyack, K. Levin</p>
            <p>We study the superfluid density $n_s(T)$ of pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductors; this determines where they are unstable and establishes signatures of their unusual order. Here we compute $n_s(T)$ for the 2D unidirectional PDW superconducting phases that emerge from a microscopic model (with nearest neighbor attraction). With gapped and gapless bands in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle dispersion, this theory provides self-consistently determined wavevectors \(\mathbf{Q}\) for the spatially modulated pairing. We report a negative $n_s$ for a significant fraction of the purportedly physical phase diagram. Independent of the microscopic model, we can generally understand that the implied instability in these superconductors arises from the variationally large \(|\mathbf{Q}|\). In the stable regime, the finite-temperature superfluid density \(n_s(T)\) displays unusual temperature dependences originating from the gapless Bogoliubov bands which reflect Van Hove-singularity-induced Sommerfeld contributions. These gapless bands, as well as the negative contributions from the Higgs mode, additionally lead to an anomalously small (highly anisotropic) superfluid density. This will then yield an unexpectedly large finite-frequency weight in the optical conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Viscosity, breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation and dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquid Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 from simulations with a neural network potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Marcorini, Rocco Pomodoro, Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi</p>
            <p>Phase change materials are exploited in non-volatile electronic memories and photonic devices that rely on a fast and reversible transformation between the amorphous and crystalline phase upon heating. The recrystallization of the amorphous phase at the operation conditions of the memories occurs in the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The dynamics of the supercooled liquid is thus of great relevance for the operation of the devices and, close to $T_g$, also for the structural relaxations of the glass that affect the performances of the memories. Information on the atomic dynamics is provided by the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and by the viscosity ($\eta$) which are, however, both difficult to be measured experimentally at the operation conditions of the devices due to the fast crystallization. In this work, we leverage a machine learning interatomic potential for the flagship phase change compound compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to compute $\eta$, $D$ and the $\alpha$-relaxation time in a wide temperature range from 1200 K to about 100 K above $T_g$. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed quantifying the fragility of the liquid and the occurrence of a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between $\eta$ and $D$ in the supercooled phase. Isoconfigurational analysis provided a visualization of the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities responsible for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The analysis revealed that the regions of most mobile atoms are related to the presence of Ge atoms with particular local environments.</p>

            <h2>Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.</p>

            <p>The optical spectra of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are dominated by tightly bound excitons and trions. In the low doping limit, trions are often described as three-body quasiparticles consisting of two electrons and one hole or vice versa. However, trions are more rigorously understood as quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an exciton and excitation of the Fermi sea - referred to as exciton Fermi polaron. Here we employ pump-probe spectroscopy to directly observe the formation of exciton Fermi polarons in a model system composed of a WSe2 monolayer adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Following the pump-injection of Rydberg excitons in WSe2, a time-delayed probe pulse tracks the development of Rydberg exciton Fermi polarons as interactions with localized carriers in the tBLG moire superlattice evolve. Both the exciton Fermi polaron relaxation rate and binding energy are found to increase with electron or hole density. Our findings provide insight into the optical response of fundamental excitations in 2D Van der Waals systems and reveal how many-body interactions give rise to emergent quasiparticles.</p>

            <h2>Photomagnetic-Chiral Anisotropy mediated by Chirality-Driven Asymmetric Spin Splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianwei Ouyang, Hang Su, Wanning Zhang, Yingying Duan, Yuxi Fang, Shunai Che, Yizhou Liu</p>
            <p>Photo-magnetic effects (PMEs), intrinsic to transition metals, arises from the interaction between light-induced angu-lar momentum and electronic spin. These effects are suppressed in noble metals with high symmetry and electron density. Introducing chiral structures can induce photomagnetic-chiral anisotropy (PM-ChA) of metals by linking chirality and spin dynamics. However, a theoretical explain remains elusive. Here, we investigated the mechanism of PM-ChA in tetrahelix-stacked chiral nanostructured gold chains (CNACs) using first-principles calculations. Non-equilibrium Green's function calculations reveal that chiral potentials enhance spin channel asymmetry by amplify-ing spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced spin splitting. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations further identify SOC as the bridge connecting chiral spintronics to PME, where chirality-driven spin flips from asymmetric geometries generate opposing photomagnetic fields in materials of different handedness. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in chiral nanostructured gold films and provide a theoretical instruction for design metallic spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin G. S. Xie, Colin J. Dale, Kiera Pond Grehan, Maggie Fen Wang, Tilman Enss, Paul S. Julienne, Zhenhua Yu, Joseph H. Thywissen</p>
            <p>The time evolution of the contact parameter provides key insights into correlation dynamics in ultracold gases. However, most contact measurements to date have focused on equilibrium systems or slow, global dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that projecting a unitary Fermi gas onto a low-lying dimer state enables rapid probing of the contact. Using $^{40}$K near a broad s-wave Feshbach resonance, we compare the strength of the dimer-projection feature to the strength of the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy. By tuning the correlation strength through temperature, we find that the dimer signal scales proportionally with the contact parameter, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Our measurements enable us to constrain the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, to which the dimer feature is the dominant contributor. We observe deviations from universal predictions due to finite-range and multichannel effects. Our results establish new universal contact relations and shed light on the structure of the clock shift in strongly interacting Fermi gases. The demonstrated ability to resolve short-range correlations on timescales shorter than the inverse Fermi energy opens new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</p>

            <p>Chiral phonons, circularly polarized lattice vibrations carrying intrinsic angular momentum, offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling heat flow, manipulating quantum states through spin-phonon coupling, and realizing exotic transport phenomena. Despite their fundamental importance, a universal framework for identifying and classifying these elusive excitations has remained out of reach. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a comprehensive symmetry-based theory that systematically classifies the helicity and the velocity-angular momentum tensor underlying phonon magnetization in thermal transport across all 230 crystallographic space groups. Our approach, grounded in fundamental representations of phononic angular momentum, reveals three distinct classes of crystals: achiral crystals with vanishing angular momentum, chiral crystals with s-wave helicity, and achiral crystals exhibiting higher-order helicity patterns beyond the s-wave. By performing high-throughput computations and symmetry analysis of the dynamical matrices for 11614 crystalline compounds, we identified 2738 materials exhibiting chiral phonon modes and shortlisted the 170 most promising candidates for future experimental investigation. These results are compiled into an open-access Chiral Phonon Materials Database website, enabling rapid screening for materials with desired chiral phonon properties. Our theoretical framework transcends phonons--it provides a universal paradigm for classifying chiral excitations in crystalline lattices, from magnons to electronic quasiparticles.</p>

            <p>Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.</p>

            <p>The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles have gained significant attention as a means to enhance data sharing, collaboration, and reuse across various domains.

By examining the FAIR-data aspect of a Materials Science and Engineering PhD project, it becomes evident that substantial cost savings can be achieved. The estimated savings are 2,600 Euros per year from the PhD project considered. This study underscores the importance of implementing FAIR data practices in engineering projects and highlights some significant economic benefits that can be derived from such initiatives. By embracing FAIR principles, organizations in the engineering sector can unlock the full potential of their data, optimize resource allocation, and drive innovation in a cost-effective manner.</p>

Focusing on the XXZ spin chain initialized in domain-wall state, we demonstrate universal power-law growth of both PE and SRE, with scaling exponents explicitly reflecting the underlying transport regimes, ballistic, diffusive, or KPZ-type superdiffusive.

            <p>Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>We study the nature of thermalization dynamics and the associated preparation (simulation) time under the repeated interaction protocol uncovering a generic anomalous, Mpemba-like trend. As a case study, we focus on a three-level system and analyze its dynamics in two complementary regimes, where the system-ancilla interaction strength is either large or small. Focusing on the estimation of the simulation time, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum number of collisions, or minimal simulation time, required to achieve a thermal state, which is within $\epsilon$ distance to the target thermal state. At zero temperature, we analytically identify a set of points (interaction strength $\times$ their duration) that minimize the simulation time. At nonzero temperature, we observe a Mpemba-like effect: Starting from a maximally mixed state, thermalization to an intermediate-temperature state takes longer than to a lower-temperature one. We provide an accurate analytical approximation for this phenomenon and demonstrate its occurrence in larger systems and under randomized interaction strengths. The prevalence of the Mpemba effect in thermal state preparation presents a significant challenge for preparing states in large systems, an open problem calling for new strategies.</p>

            <h2>The Three-Dimensional Velocity Field of Kinesin-Driven Microtubules in Torroidal Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Fan, Kenneth Breuer</p>
            <p>We study two regimes of flow in multiple three-dimensional toroidal channels by tracking the fluorescent spherical particles in the kinesin-driven microtubule systems: ``chaotic'' flow and ``coherent'' flow. In the smallest aspect ratio torus, where the channel height $h$ is a quarter of the width $w$, the active system shows zero mean velocity, small-scale isotropy in fluctuation and no persistent flow structure. In other tori with higher aspect ratios $h/w$ close to 1, we find faster coherent flows along the azimuthal direction and increasing fluctuation strengths with growing confinement geometries. Regardless of flow regimes, the flow profiles at $r-z$ cross-section and $r-\theta$ plane are symmetric. The ``coherent'' profiles show two criteria: ``Poiseuille-like'' profiles, which have the peak velocities near the centers of channels; a ``peak-separated'' profile, which has four peak velocities near a certain distance to four confining surfaces. These flow profiles, after scaled by the local isotropic fluctuation strength, reveal universal three-dimensional flow structures among the ``Poiseuille-like'' criterion and the same level of scaled peak velocity at the ``peak-separated'' one. These results illustrate scalable flow structures in this kinesin-driven microtubule active system.</p>

            <p>From the flutter of aircraft wings to an umbrella flipping inside out in the wind, fluid-induced elastic instabilities are a major concern in aeroelastic design. However, Nature often harnesses these instabilities to achieve new functionalities, such as the mechanical snap-through of the Venus flytrap. Inspired by this, engineers and physicists have increasingly exploited elastic instabilities to enable rapid shape changes in metamaterials and soft robots, provided the structure remains elastic throughout the transition. Here, we study the fluid-induced snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell at low Reynolds numbers, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low Reynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments, fluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling analysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the geometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the hydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active components. These valves could be deployed in soft robotics and, because our results are expressed in terms of key dimensionless parameters, we speculate that the system can be miniaturized for use in microfluidic circuits. Beyond the application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical example of fluid-induced elastic instability at low Reynolds numbers, providing a foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive structures.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate dynamics of trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.</p>

            <p>In this work we investigate the ground state properties of a candidate quantum spin liquid using a superconducting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</p>

We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.</p>

In this work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks -- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures. The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows, offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity to adversarial attacks.</p>

            <p>Using the Kramers-Wannier transfer matrix method we studied several decorated Ising chains. The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics, including the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a number of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange constants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we calculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and corresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic expressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with different interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state entropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in terms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.</p>

            <p>Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states. Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is maximized in \textit{in vivo}.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin</p>
            <p>In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity for many spatially separated emitters remained challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$. Our results encompass quantum systems ranging from cold atomic gases and neutral-atom arrays to molecular aggregates and solid-state materials.</p>

            <h2>Tunable plasmon modes and topological transitions in single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debasmita Giri, John Schliemann, Rafael Molina, Alexander Lopez</p>
            <p>We investigate the plasmonic response of single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials under the influence of a tunable parameter $\delta$ that governs topological transitions via Dirac cone generation/merging and incorporating band inversion terms. For single-layer systems, we demonstrate that the emergence of Dirac cones leads to an enhanced plasmon frequency range and that the plasmonic spectrum exhibits strong anisotropy, especially for finite $\delta$ and vanishing inversion terms. In the bilayer configurations, we uncover a second plasmon mode whose relative phase, with respect to the first mode, can be actively controlled by rotating the upper layer which impacts the symmetry of the charge oscillations across the layers. This tunability enables switching between in- and out-of-phase plasmonic modes, offering a route toward phase-controlled collective excitations. Our results highlight the potential of semi-Dirac systems for topological plasmonics and interferometric applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond this http URL extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</p>

            <h2>Noise resilience of deterministic analog combinatorial optimization solvers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clemens Gneiting, Farad Khoyratee, Enrico Rinaldi, Khyati Jain, Rishab Khincha, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>Several continuous dynamical systems have recently been proposed as special-purpose analog computers designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as $k$-SAT or the Ising problem. While combinatorial optimization problems are known to be NP-hard, and thus scale, in the worst case, exponentially with the problem size, these analog solvers promise substantial speed-up and scaling advantages in finding the solution. The underlying algorithms, which can be cast in the form of differential equations, generically involve highly chaotic dynamics and thus assume that the system variables can be processed with, in principle, arbitrary precision. However, both actual physical systems as well as finite digital machines, which are used to virtually emulate the dynamics, can process the evolution only with finite precision, be it because of intrinsic noise or because of limited precision in number representation. We investigate the impact of such noise on the solution-finding capability. To this end, we focus on two representative analog solvers, designed to address the Ising problem and the $k$-SAT problem, respectively. Our numerical analysis reveals that the ability of these algorithms to find solutions exhibits a threshold behavior under the addition of noise, where the solution-finding capability remains mostly uncompromised below a noise threshold, while it rapidly deteriorates above the threshold. As we show, these noise tolerance thresholds decrease with the problem size, following an approximate algebraic scaling. This allows us to infer principal limits on the problem sizes that can be efficiently tackled with these solvers under given noise levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Can Polat, Hasan Kurban, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban</p>
            <p>Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations. Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and (iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability in large-scale multimodal models.

In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective.

We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aswathy K R, Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</p>

            <p>High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.</p>

In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</p>

            <p>We propose a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis accounting for the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases. It consists of two conditions that any system with a degenerate spectrum must fulfill in order to thermalize. The failure of each of them generates a different non-thermalizing scenario. One is due to the absence of chaos and may indicate that extra constants of motion are required to describe equilibrium states. The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase. We explore the applicability of this formalism by means of numerical experiments on a three-site Bose-Hubbard model with two non-commuting discrete symmetries.</p>

            <p>Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luigi Frau, Simone Zanotti, Lydie Ferrier, Dario Gerace, Hai Son Nguyen</p>
            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian operators: at the EP, the complex eigenvalues coalesce, i.e., they become degenerate in both their real and imaginary parts. In two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal lattices, these elements can be tailored through structural engineering. In particular, it is known that a quadratic degeneracy in the photonic band structure can be split into a pair of Dirac points (DPs) by breaking one of the unit cell symmetries, and each DP can be further split into a pair of EPs by introducing losses. Each EP of the pair is then connected by an open isofrequency curve, called the bulk Fermi arc (BFA). In this work, we introduce a simplified effective Hamiltonian model accounting for the main physical properties of these EPs and BFAs. Then, we systematically investigate, through numerical simulations, how EPs as well as the related BFA depend on the type and amount of broken symmetries in the given 2D unit cell of a realistic photonic crystal slab implementation. Our results show that it is possible to tailor the position and distance of the EP pair in reciprocal space, as well as the curvature and orientation of the associated BFA, by deterministically tuning the unit cell structure. Importantly, the symmetry-breaking strategy we propose is general and can be applied to a broad range of photonic crystal designs beyond the specific example studied here. This approach opens new possibilities for exploiting EPs in applications involving photonic crystal lattices in, e.g., light-emitting devices or fundamental physics studies.</p>

            <p>Hyperbolic materials support exotic polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion that enable subdiffraction focusing and enhanced light-matter interactions. Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) offer significant advantages over hyperbolic phonon polaritons, which operate in the infrared frequency range - namely lower losses and greater technological relevance. However, these HPPs remained experimentally inaccessible until the recent identification of molybdenum(IV) oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Here we achieve the first direct real-space and real-time visualization of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in natural materials using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy with femtosecond time resolution and nanometer spatial resolution. Our direct imaging enables measurement of HPP propagation velocities and lengths, real-time observation of plasmon-material edge interactions, experimental validation of hyperbolic dispersion through polarization-dependent experiments, and direct visualization of hyperbolic focusing phenomena. This spatiotemporal visualization validates theoretical predictions while establishing an experimental foundation for exploiting these unusual light-matter states in fundamental studies of hyperbolic media and nanophotonics.</p>

            <p>We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</p>

To this end, we demonstrate how a single spinon can be excited by adding one extra spin to the ground state. This procedure accurately reproduces all key features of the spinon's dispersion. These follow from the vanishing norm of the excited state which is triggered by the ground state entanglement. Next, we show that the spinon dispersion can be approximately reproduced if we replace the true ground state with the simplest valence-bond solid. This proves that the spinon of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model can be understood as a single spin flowing through a valence-bond solid.</p>

            <p>Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions or equivalently independent species, which corresponds to the number of measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to relate the experimentally observed dimensional features to conservation laws and underlying CRN structure. Our approach extends to any Markov model as well as many nonlinear models in statistical physics and furnishes new analytical tools to find exact solutions. In particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be captured by the co-production law relating co-production relationships to emergent non-integer conservation laws and broken cycles. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law, and characterizes certain types of CRN behavior. We also obtain laws that allow us to relate data dimension to network structure in cases where some species cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique, allowing to narrow down candidate CRNs from experimental data more effectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate that an energetic disorder, which usually results from a structural disorder, is instead a more essential feature of glass. Specifically, we develop a distinguishable-particle glassy crystal (DPGC) in which particles are ordered in a face-centered cubic lattice and follow particle-dependent random interactions, leading to an energetic disorder in the particle configuration space. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of vacancy-induced particle diffusion show typical glassy behaviors. A unique feature of this molecular model is the knowledge of the complete set of inherent structures with easily calculable free energies, implying a well-understood potential energy landscape.</p>

            <p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</p>

For other choices of the activity parameter, the system is linearly unstable in the long wavelength limit, implying crumpling, or has intermediate wavevector instabilities, suggesting patterns. We argue that in such an active membrane thermal noises dominate over any active noises, and use those to calculate the correlation functions of membrane conformation fluctuations in the stable case, and the associated correlation functions of the embedding bulk flow velocities</p>

            <h2>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moiré Chern bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao-Ming Jian, Meng Cheng, Cenke Xu</p>
            <p>We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide moiré system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductivity, implying the robustness of the mFTI's gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO's complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique one that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product TOs" with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs can be constructed for a pair of $1/q$-filled conjugate Chern bands. We classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.</p>

            <p>Metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials are a useful platform for emerging microelectronic, optoelectronic, and neuromorphic devices, but their discovery is hindered by the high computational cost of electronic structure modeling, the complexity of underlying mechanisms, and the challenges of experimental validation. Here, we present a physics-informed machine learning framework that accelerates the discovery of thermally driven MIT materials. Using a trained classifier, we screen a crystal structure database to identify promising candidates for higher fidelity simulations. We focus on Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and use density functional theory (DFT) to determine their electronic and magnetic ground states and assess their microscopic MIT mechanisms. We further apply machine learning regression models to estimate their transition temperatures and employ synthesis prediction tools to identify likely precursors and reaction routes. This integrated approach reduces the time and effort required to identify, understand, and synthesize new MIT materials, providing a generalizable pathway for accelerating correlated quantum materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Universality of giant diffusion in tilted periodic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kento Iida, Andreas Dechant, Takuma Akimoto</p>
            <p>Giant diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in a periodic potential with an external force is significantly enhanced by the external force, is a non-trivial non-equilibrium phenomenon. We propose a simple stochastic model of giant diffusion, which is based on a biased continuous-time random walk (CTRW) with flight time. By introducing a flight time representing traversal dynamics, we derive the diffusion coefficient using renewal theory and demonstrate its universal peak behavior under various periodic potentials, especially in low-temperature regimes. Giant diffusion is universally observed in the sense that there is a peak of the diffusion coefficient for any tilted periodic potentials and the degree of the diffusivity is greatly enhanced especially for low-temperature regimes. The biased CTRW models with flight times are applied to diffusion under three tilted periodic potentials. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the maximum diffusion coefficient and the external force that attains the maximum are presented for diffusion under a tilted sawtooth potential.</p>

            <p>Formation of a fluid drop, such as observed in dripping faucet, has been extensively studied for understanding singular dynamics widely observed in nature. The singular dynamics is often self-similar, i.e., the shape at different times are collapsed onto a master curve after rescaling. Here, we investigate the bubble breakup in an original setup, where a metal disk entrains air into viscous fluid with lubricating films on its surfaces in a confined cell, focusing on the dependence of the dynamics on the film thickness e. As a result, we find out the dynamics is self-similar as expected, but the shape of the master curve and the scaling exponents characterizing the self-similar dynamics are revealed to be sensitively dependent on e. We discuss analogy between the present study and critical phenomena in thermodynamic transitions, to suggest a promising future direction of the singular dynamics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</p>

The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses.

            <p>Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement Rényi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas G. J. Chandler, Saverio E. Spagnolie</p>
            <p>A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a large scale flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stresses of a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</p>

            <h2>Minimal thermodynamic cost of communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic cost of communication is a major factor in the thermodynamic cost of real-world computers, both biological and digital. Despite its importance, the fundamental principles underlying this cost remain poorly understood. This paper makes two major contributions to addressing this gap. First, we derive a universal relationship between information transmission rate and minimal entropy production (EP) by focusing on the mismatch cost (MMC) component of thermodynamic cost. The resulting relationship holds independently of the underlying physical dynamics, making it broadly applicable. We discuss the implications of the derived minimal communication cost for work extraction in measurement-and-feedback protocols, and through examples involving binary channels, we show that the relationship between transmission rate and minimal thermodynamic cost can exhibit diminishing returns in certain scenarios. Second, we extend this thermodynamic analysis to the computational front and back ends critical to communication-namely, encoding and decoding to reduce errors in noisy transmission. Using the framework of periodic machines, we establish strictly positive minimal costs for implementing linear error-correcting codes. We compare these costs with end-to-end error rates, highlighting trade-offs between thermodynamic cost and decoding accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Shinjo, Shigetoshi Sota, Seiji Yunoki, Takami Tohyama</p>
            <p>The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elisa Vallini, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Based on high-throughput screening and experimental data, we find that CeCo$_2$P$_2$ is unique in heavy-fermion materials: it has a Kondo effect at a high temperature which is nonetheless below a Co-antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. This begs the question: how is the Kondo singlet formed? \emph{All} other magnetic Kondo materials do not first form magnetism on the atoms whose electrons are supposed to screen the local moments. We theoretically explain these observations and show the multifaceted uniqueness of CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a playground for Kondo, magnetism, flat band, and topological physics. At high temperatures, the itinerant Co $c$ electrons of the system form non-atomic bands with a narrow bandwidth, leading to a high antiferromagnetic transition temperature. We show that the quantum geometry of the bands promotes in-plane ferromagnetism, while the weak dispersion along the $z$ direction facilitates out-of-plane antiferromagnetism. At low temperatures, we uncover a novel phase that manifests the coexistence of Co-antiferromagnetism and the Kondo effect, linked to the $P\cdot T$-protected Kramers' doublets and the filling-enforced metallic nature of $c$ electrons in the antiferromagnetic phase. Subsequently, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in cooperation with glide-mirror-$z$ symmetry, creates nodal-line excitation near the Fermi energy. Our results emphasize the importance of lattice symmetry and quantum geometry, Kondo physics, and magnetism in the understanding of the correlation physics of this unique compound. We also test our theory on the structurally similar compound LaCo$_2$P$_2$ and show how we are able to understand its vastly different phase diagram.</p>

            <h2>System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, Francesco Caravelli, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.</p>

            <p>Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</p>

            <p>Phonons in chiral crystal structures can be circularly polarized, making them chiral. Chiral phonons carry angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, versatile direct band gap semiconductors, can easily form chiral structures by incorporating chiral organic cations. As a result, they exhibit phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and the spin Seebeck effect, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields trained against density functional theory calculations, we confirm the presence of chiral phonons, a potential key factor for these effects. Our analysis reveals that low-energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework, primarily exhibit chirality. Under a temperature gradient, these chiral phonons generate substantial angular momentum, leading to experimentally observable effects. These findings position chiral 2D perovskites as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between phononic, electronic, spintronic, and thermal properties.</p>

            <p>The nonreciprocity created by dipolar coupling, electric currents, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is discussed in cases where the magnon propagation direction has a component parallel to the toroidal moment. A criterion for calculating the toroidal moments is established, addressing the issue of correct origin selection by considering compensated and uncompensated magnetization distributions. This criterion is then applied to various nonreciprocal magnetic systems, with the calculations consistent with those reported in the literature and predicting the existence of nonreciprocity in a more general manner. These results broaden the physical significance of the toroidal moment and facilitate the identification and estimation of nonreciprocity in magnonic systems. This work also clarifies the interrelations between different definitions of the toroidal moment for confined structures, where a surface term arising from surface-bound currents connects these definitions without the need for time-averaging. Comparing these definitions of the toroidal moment applied to different magnetic textures demonstrates that they are always parallel but may differ in magnitude and sign. The discrepancy in the different definitions is deemed irrelevant since its direction, rather than its magnitude, primarily predicts the existence of magnon nonreciprocity.</p>

The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</p>

Assembly of the helical geometry of biopolymers is a foundational step in a hierarchy of structure that eventually leads to biological activity.

Using a simulation technique based on the morphometric approach to solvation, we performed computer experiments in which a short, flexible tube-modelling a biopolymer in an aqueous environment-folds solely based on the interaction of the tube with the solvent. Our findings reveal a variety of helical structures that assemble depending on solvent conditions, including overhand knots and symmetric double helices. By differentiating the role of solvation, our work illuminates the environment of all soluble biomolecules, demonstrating that the solvent can drive fundamental rearrangements, even up to tying a simple overhand knot.</p>

The electric field is supposed to be concentrated in very narrow regions around the two junctions and is also approximated to be static. In this way, not only the laws of electricity, thermodynamics, and microreversibility is consistent within this approach, but also the transistor can be easily modeled as a two-dimensional system. We perform the full counting statistics of the two coupled currents, and the fluctuation theorem is shown to hold. Moreover, we show that the geometric shape of the transistor exert great influence on the transport behavior. By modeling the transistor in two dimensions, the signal-amplification factor up to about $164$ can be achieved, which is comparable to the typical value of realistic transistors in industry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.</p>

            <h2>Conditions for orbital selective altermagnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: tight binding model, similarities with cuprates and implications on superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carmine Autieri, Giuseppe Cuono, Debmalya Chakraborty, Paola Gentile, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Hattori, Hirotaka Irie, Tadashi Kadowaki, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of single-particle mobility edge (SPME) in a ladder network under a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpita Goswami</p>
            <p>We examine the localization transition in a two-leg ladder model incorporating a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion as an inter-leg hopping in different parametric regions. In our model, we have introduced a distortion that is neither periodic (Bloch-type) nor random (Anderson-type) but instead has a slowly varying pseudorandom pattern described by $\Gamma_{n}= \lambda cos(2 \pi Q n^{\nu})$, where $0<\nu <1$. We have demonstrated that in the ladder model at $0<\nu <1$ limit, there is some point at which it is not possible to see a pure metal-insulator transition due to the presence of a single particle mobility edge (SPME) state. We have seen that, unlike the one-dimensional AA model, where the slowly varying potential has been introduced as an onsite potential term, the delocalized states are present beyond the $ \lambda=2t$ limit. Further analysis shows that a pure metal-to-insulator transition occurs for $\nu=1$ at $\lambda=2t.$ We also studied the scale-invariant nature of the mobility edge, which confirms its robustness. The wave packet dynamics also validates the presence of the mobility edge. We have seen that for the point $\nu < 1$ the wave packet dynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through nearly-ballistic (nearly delocalized) to superdiffusive (fractal) phase. In contrast to $\nu <1$, for $\nu=1$ the dynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through ordinary diffusive (critical) to localized phase.</p>

In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moiré quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate and efficient solution without human bias. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling Optimal Diffusion for Infection Control in Brownian Particle Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Takahashi, Makiko Sasada, Takuma Akimoto</p>
            <p>Understanding the spread of infectious diseases requires integrating movement, physical constraints, and spatial configurations into epidemiological models. In this study, we investigate how particle diffusivity, hardcore interactions, and non-equilibrium initial conditions influence infection dynamics within a system of Brownian particles. Using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we reveal a nontrivial relationship between diffusivity and the speed of infection spread. Specifically, when particles are initially positioned at uniform distances greater than the infection radius -- a non-equilibrium configuration -- there exists an optimal diffusion coefficient that minimizes the infection propagation speed. This counterintuitive result arises from the competition between diffusive timescales and the rate of infection transmission. The presence of an optimal diffusivity is observed both in systems with and without hardcore interactions, provided that the infection radius exceeds the mean lattice spacing. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding and controlling the spread of infections in confined and diffusive environments, with potential implications for designing movement-based strategies for infection control.</p>

            <p>A central focus in high strain rate research is understanding the dynamic behavior of materials at strain rates where a strength upturn is observed. While strength upturns at strain rates of $10^3$ to $10^4~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ have been widely reported in the literature, their occurrence in certain materials remains controversial, and the underlying physics driving this phenomenon is not yet fully understood. Current mechanical testing methods are limited, as no single technique spans the full strain rate range of $10^1$ to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ where this phenomenon is expected, and a unified technique would enable consistent post-deformation characterization with minimal error. To address this, we developed a customized piezoelectric in situ nanomechanical test setup, enabling constant indentation strain rates up to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the first time. Using this system, we examined rate-dependent hardness in single-crystalline molybdenum, nanocrystalline nickel, and amorphous fused silica over strain rates from $10^1$ to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, remarkably revealing a hardness upturn in all three materials. Further, post-deformation analysis of single-crystalline molybdenum revealed that the hardness upturn was primarily driven by increased dislocation density, with phonon drag -- traditionally considered a dominant contributor -- playing a minimal role.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$\%), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70~K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. We quantitatively describe both FMR and SQUID observables using atomistic spin model operating on a common set of parameters. The level of agreement, achieved without tuning parameters between datasets, demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the approach in capturing the essential physics of spin-diluted, percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p>This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through a $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen [1, 2]. For transmission $t\geq0.800$, we measured the tunneling exponent $\bar{g} = 0.333 \pm 0.005$ averaged over 29 independent data sets, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.</p>

            <p>The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyang Jiang, Tobias Holder, Binghai Yan</p>
            <p>Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.</p>

            <p>Hypothesis: Anisotropic rod particles in capillary suspensions form complex network structures with distinctive orientation patterns and rheological properties that differ significantly from spherical particle systems. By identifying the orientation of individual particles, we are able to acquire invaluable experimental insight into the bulk particle orientation measurements. Experiments: Glass microrods were dispersed in capillary suspensions with varied secondary liquid volume fractions. The resulting microstructural characteristics were analyzed using confocal microscopy. Meanwhile, their rheological properties were measured through rheometry and rheoconfocal techniques. Particle networks were quantified in terms of coordination number, clustering coefficient, and orientation distribution. Findings: As the secondary liquid volume fraction increased, rod networks transitioned from point-to-point contact configurations to side-to-side aligned clusters. Unlike spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreased with increasing coordination number, indicating the formation of complex particle cluster configurations beyond simple side-to-side alignment. The rod networks demonstrated higher sensitivity to deformation, and samples with higher side-to-side contact probability exhibit higher viscoplastic fragility. These results provide a foundation for designing advanced materials with precisely tunable mechanical properties through controlled anisotropic particle interactions in capillary suspensions.</p>

Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</p>

Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} < {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 was observed nearly eighty years ago, but the mechanism underlying its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition remains elusive. The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role, however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into a order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along <111> direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the <111> polar Ti displacements.

            <p>The ab initio computational method known as Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+$U$) captures well ground electronic structures of a set of solids that are poorly described by standard DFT alone. Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fröhlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Franosch, Cristiano De Michele, Rolf Schilling</p>
            <p>For a fluid of convex hard particles, characterized by a length scale $\sigma_\text{min}$ and an anisotropy parameter $\epsilon$, we develop a formalism allowing one to relate thermodynamic quantities to the body's shape. In a first step its thermodynamics is reduced to that of spherical particles. The latter have a hard core of diameter $\sigma_\text{min }$ and a soft shell with a thickness $\epsilon \sigma_\text{min}/2$. Besides their hard core repulsion at $\sigma_\text{min }$ they interact by effective entropic forces which will be calculated. Based on this mapping, a second step provides a perturbative method for the systematic calculation of thermodynamic quantities with the shape anisotropy $\epsilon$ as smallness parameter. In leading order in $\epsilon $, the equation of state is derived as a functional of the particle's shape. To illustrate these findings, they are applied to a one- and two-dimensional fluid of ellipses and compared with results from different analytical approaches, and our computer simulations. The mapping to spherical particles also implies that any phase transition of spherical particles, e.g., the liquid-hexatic transition, also exists for the nonspherical ones, and shifts linearly with $\epsilon $ for weak shape anisotropy. This is supported by our Monte-Carlo simulation.</p>

            <h2>A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Madany, Benjamin Kincaid, Aqsa Shaikh, Elizabeth Morningstar, Lubos Mitas</p>
            <p>We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O.V. Pshyk, J. Patidar, C. Cancellieri, S. Siol</p>
            <p>Auger parameter analysis provides in-depth information about the electronic and chemical bonding properties of TiN and AlN thin films, which are relevant across a wide range of technologies. Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination. Additionally, we demonstrate how common procedures such as ambient air exposure and Ar+ sputter-etching influence the Auger parameters, highlighting the importance of surface preparation in spectroscopic analysis.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</p>

            <h2>A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Subjective Evaluation: Cognitive Polarization and Entropic Measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bumned Soodchomshom</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum-inspired framework to model subjective evaluation processes using state vectors in Hilbert space. In this approach, individual preferences are represented as cognitive states polarized between 'like' and 'dislike', enabling a continuous interpretation of evaluative attitudes. The evolution of these states is characterized on the Bloch sphere, and the cognitive coherence is interpreted geometrically. To further analyze the uncertainty and diversity in subjective preferences, we introduce both Shannon entropy (at the individual level) and Von Neumann entropy (at the group level) into the framework. A small-scale simulated dataset is used to conceptually demonstrate how these entropy measures can reveal internal indecisiveness and collective incoherence. The model offers a physically grounded and mathematically expressive tool for quantifying subjectivity.</p>

            <h2>Transient dynamics of associative memory models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David G. Clark</p>
            <p>Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape near stored patterns as lingering traces of the stable basins that existed below capacity. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.</p>

            <h2>Crossover between Solid-like and Liquid-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> X. R. Tian, D. M. Zhang, B. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong</p>
            <p>In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Approach to network failure due to intrinsic fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaunak Roy, Vimal Kishore, M. S. Santhanam</p>
            <p>A networked system can fail when most of its components are unable to support flux through the nodes and edges. As studied earlier this scenario can be triggered by an external perturbation such as an intentional attack on nodes or for internal reasons such as due to malfunction of nodes. In either case, the asymptotic failure of the network is preceded by a cascade of nodal failures. In this work, we focus on the nodal failure arising from the intrinsic fluctuations in the flux passing through the nodes. By modeling these as extreme events, it is shown that three distinct nodal failure regimes can be identified before a complete network failure takes place. Further, the approach to network failure through the three regimes is shown to be qualitatively similar on a square lattice, all-to-all, scale free, and Erdos-Renyi networks. We obtain approximate analytical description of the approach to failure for an all-to-all network. This is also demonstrated numerically for real transportation network of flights.</p>

            <p>Illuminating integer quantum Hall matter with polarized light can drive quantum phase transitions. Technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity make such experiments challenging in the solid state. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report experimental results from such a 1D quantum simulator of 2D integer quantum Hall matter driven by light of variable polarization. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</p>

            <p>We conjecture that the time-reversal-even component of the pair production rate $\Gamma$ of particles in background fields in conformal 3+1 dimensional field theories is given by the anomalous trace $\langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor: $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu} \rangle \Theta( \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We show that this relation, written in mostly-plus metric, correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation of massless particles both in scalar and spinor versions of quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. The conjectured formula also reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 221502 (2023)]. A concurrent mechanism of the particle production due to the axial anomaly is briefly discussed and critical remarks on the state-dependence are also given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guido Giachetti, Nicolò Defenu</p>
            <p>In general, classical fully-connected systems are known to undergo violent relaxation. This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to stationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time dynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we analyze the ``quantum" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of generic many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the thermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur very specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective Hamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum" violent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical counterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which, depending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between violent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin version of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to exhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation picture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even in the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the dynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled systems.</p>

            <p>Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled by high-intensity lasers. We investigated the near-infrared absorption of free-standing membranes of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a candidate sail material. To resolve the small but non-zero optical loss, we used photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), for which we developed a self-referencing modality where a PCI measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with monolayer graphene deposited on the membrane. The graphene increases the absorption of the sample by orders of magnitude, such that it can be measured by ellipsometry, without significantly affecting the thermal properties. We measured the absorption coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be (1.5-3) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, making it a suitable sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^2$. By comparison, silicon-rich "low stress" SiN$_x$ (x~1), with a measured absorption coefficient of approximately 8 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities. Our self-referencing technique enables testing of low-loss membranes of various materials for laser sails and other applications.</p>

            <p>The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been extensively explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of an MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcomes the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to an MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law phase transition as the measurement strength is increased. Our numerical results indicate that the critical point should be described by a certain conformal field theory, while the transition does not belong to a conventional universality class such as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.</p>

            <p>We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the bubble-formation period and the bubble size as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we clearly identified that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in the viscous fluid beneath the trapped air balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, which demonstrates the potential of scaling analysis even in complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the bubble size: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role, different from the conventional mechanism of Tate, in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advances our knowledge of generation and pinch-off of bubbles, with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a promising avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characteristics of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</p>

            <p>Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.</p>

            <p>Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarizing noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-André model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-André) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</p>

            <p>We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</p>

            <h2>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Kibe, Pratik Roy</p>
            <p>The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</p>

            <h2>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartik Chhajed, Franz S. Gruber, Natalie A. Dye, Frank Jülicher, Marko Popović</p>
            <p>A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</p>

            <p>Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\mathrm{\mu m}$}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché</p>
            <p>Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</p>

            <h2>Charge Modulation in the Vortex Halo of a Superconductor Enhances its Critical Magnetic Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anurag Banerjee, Catherine Pépin, Nandini Trivedi, Amit Ghosal</p>
            <p>When an orbital magnetic field suppresses superconductivity, forming periodic vortices in type-II superconductors, subdominant orders can emerge in the vortex cores. Rather than competing with superconductivity, we find that the emergent charge order within the halo of a vortex makes superconductivity more robust by enhancing the upper critical field. We establish that charge modulations nucleate in and around the vortex core for model parameters dictated by the underlying non-superconducting state. We further show that the spectral signatures from the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states in vortex cores track the charge modulation. The CdGM-like peak is found to shift toward the gap edge and oscillate from particle-to-hole bias from site to site, signaling charge modulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mina-Lou Schleith, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moiré systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. Parametrizing the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R>1$ ($R < 1$), we use exact diagonalization to verify nonzero energy-angular momentum dispersion for any $R \neq 1$. For our choice of non-uniform field, we show that any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes for any value of $R$ can be mapped exactly to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons and the resulting anyon dispersion exactly, up to an overall scaling constant, for the cases of short-range and Coulomb interaction. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Origins of chalcogenide perovskite instability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adelina Carr, Talia Glinberg, Nathan Stull, James R. Neilson, Christopher J. Bartel</p>
            <p>Chalcogenide perovskites, particularly II-IV ABS3 compounds, are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications. However, these materials frequently exhibit instability in two respects: 1) a preference for structures containing one-dimensional edge- or face-sharing octahedral networks instead of the three-dimensional corner-sharing perovskite framework (polymorphic instability), and (2) a tendency to decompose into competing compositions (hull instability). We evaluate the stability of 81 ABS3 compounds using Density Functional Theory, finding that only BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 are both polymorphically and hull stable, with the NH4CdCl3-type structure the preferred polymorph for 77% of these compounds. Comparison with existing tolerance factor models demonstrates that these approaches work well for known perovskites but overpredict stability for compositions without published experimental results. Polymorphic stability analysis reveals that perovskite structures are stabilized by strong B-S bonding interactions, while needle structures exhibit minimal B-S covalency, suggesting that electrostatic rather than covalent interactions drive the preference for edge-sharing motifs. Hull stability analysis comparing ABS3 to ABO3 analogues reveals a weaker inductive effect in sulfides as a possible explanation for the scarcity of sulfides compared with oxides. The relative instability of ABS3 compounds is further supported by experimental synthesis attempts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the origins of instability in chalcogenide perovskites and highlight the challenges in expanding this promising materials class beyond the few materials that have been reported to date.</p>

            <p>In quantum many-body physics, one aims to understand emergent phenomena and effects of strong interactions, ideally by developing a simple theoretical picture. Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sewon Park, Jaehoon Ji, Joakim Andreasson, Jeong Ho You, Jong Hyun Choi</p>
            <p>This article reviews recent progress in two-dimensional (2D) hybrid structures that integrate transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with photochromic molecules for photodetector applications. Atomically thin TMD semiconductors offer strong light-matter interaction, tunable bandgaps, and efficient carrier transport, making them suitable for photodetectors. Photochromic molecules, capable of reversible structural changes in response to external light, can modulate their chemical, optical, and electronic properties. The combinations of various light-adaptive compounds and TMDs provide a versatile platform to explore optically programmable behaviors such as wavelength-selective photoresponse, nonvolatile switching, and multilevel memory characteristics. TMD/photochromic hybrids offer new functional capabilities that are difficult to achieve with either component alone. This mini-review summarizes material properties, interfacial integration strategies, working mechanisms, and representative device demonstrations. We conclude by highlighting future research directions toward the practical implementation of photoresponsive hybrid systems in high-performance adaptive optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>In crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry, zone-center phonons can acquire a finite angular momentum via velocity-dependent forces on the nuclei. Despite having the same order of magnitude as the electron spin angular momentum, the phonon angular momentum can be hard to detect because the frequency splitting is small. Here, by developing a theory of lattice magneto-optical effects in reflection and transmission, we show that infrared magnetic circular dichroism is a sensitive probe of zone-center phonon chirality. We evaluate the infrared magneto-optical Faraday, Kerr, and circular-dichroism spectra of CrI$_3$ from time-dependent density-functional theory in the adiabatic local-density approximation. We find sizeable circular dichroism from the infrared-active E$_u$ mode at $\approx 214$ cm$^{-1}$, even though the calculated splitting is only 0.22 cm$^{-1}$.</p>

            <p>Uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs), which utilize only electrons as the active carriers, have become indispensable in high-speed optoelectronics due to their unique capabilities, such as high saturation power and broad bandwidth. However, extending the operating wavelengths into the visible region for wider applications is challenging due to the lack of suitable wide-bandgap III-V semiconductor combinations with the necessary band alignment and lattice matching. Here, we show that a UTC-PD based on a van der Waals heterojunction composed of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), as a photoabsorption layer and a gallium nitride (GaN) film as a carrier transport layer, offers a solution to this challenge. The fast vertical carrier transport across the heterointerface is enabled by the direct epitaxial growth of a MoS2 layer on a GaN film. Our device demonstrates a frequency response in the several-GHz range with a quantum efficiency on the order of 1% throughout the entire visible spectrum, highlighting the promise for high-speed visible optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Topologically nontrivial and trivial flat bands via weak and strong interlayer coupling in twisted bilayer honeycomb optical lattices for ultracold atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjie Sui, Wei Han, Zheng Vitto Han, Zengming Meng, Jing Zhang</p>
            <p>In recent years, flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing topological properties, extremely slow electron velocities, and enhanced density of states. Extending twisted bilayer systems to new configurations is highly desirable, as it offers promising opportunities to explore flat bands beyond TBG. Here, we study both topological and trivial flat bands in a twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice for ultracold atoms and present the evolution of the flat bands with different interlayer coupling strength (ICS). Our results demonstrate that an isolated topological flat band can emerge at the Dirac point energy for a specific value of weak ICS, referred to as the ``critical coupling". This occurs over a wide range of twist angles, surpassing the limits of the magic angle in TBG systems. When the ICS is slightly increased beyond the critical coupling value, the topological flat band exhibits degenerate band crossings with both the upper and lower adjacent bands at the high-symmetry $\Gamma_s$ point. As the ICS is further increased into the strong coupling regime, trivial flat bands arise around Dirac point energy. Meanwhile, more trivial flat bands appear, extending from the lowest to higher energy bands, and remain flat as the ICS increases. The topological properties of the flat bands are studied through the winding pattern of the Wilson loop spectrum. Our research provides deeper insights into the formation of flat bands in ultracold atoms with highly controllable twisted bilayer optical lattices, and may contribute to the discovery of new strongly correlated states of matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur, Fan Yang, Magali Korolev</p>
            <p>The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range Neel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method ``the bipartite fluctuations''. This $J_1-J_2$ system may be realized in materials and engineered in quantum circuits, optical lattices.</p>

            <p>Recently, a mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, based on spin-orbit interaction associated with mobile (conduction) electrons has been proposed. Here, we consider another mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization, which is based on spin-orbit coupling attributed to localized spins and leading to the antisymmetric exchange (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) interaction. The basic element of the mechanism of magnon-plasmon coupling relies on the modification of the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction by the electric field associated with plasmons. We show, that the modification of the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya components due to electric field accompanied by plasmons may lead to hybridization of magnons and plasmons. Moreover, we also show that an external electric field normal to the layer (due to a gate voltage, for instance) can be used as a tool to tune the strength of the magnon-plasmon coupling.</p>

Here, we demonstrate current-controlled magnon-magnon coupling between cavity and boundary modes in an ultrathin film of Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). Cavity modes emerge in a BiYIG region between two Pt nanostripes, where interfacial anisotropy modifies the magnon dispersion. These modes hybridize with boundary magnons confined within the Pt-capped BiYIG, resulting in an anticrossing gap. Modeling based on dipole-exchange spin-wave dispersion accurately reproduces the observed modes and their hybridization. Spin current injection via the spin Hall effect in a Pt nanostripe disrupts the cavity boundary conditions and suppresses both cavity modes and hybridization upon driving the system beyond the damping compensation threshold. Furthermore, tuning the microwave power applied to a microstrip antenna enables controlled detuning of the anticrossing gap. Our findings provide a platform for exploring spin current-magnon interactions and designing on-chip reconfigurable magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Quantum criticality plays a central role in understanding non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems. In this review, we explore the quantum critical Eliashberg theory, which extends conventional Eliashberg approaches to non-Fermi liquid regimes governed by critical fluctuations. We discuss the theoretical foundations and recent developments in the field, focusing on the interplay between electronic interactions and bosonic modes near quantum phase transitions as described in the Yukawa-coupled version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Special emphasis is placed on the breakdown of quasiparticle coherence, anomalous scaling behaviour, Cooper pairing without quasiparticles, and emergent universality in different physical settings. Starting from a zero-dimensional "quantum-dot" model, we discuss the generalization to higher spatial dimensions and demonstrate the connection between quantum-critical Eliashberg theory and holographic superconductivity. Our analysis provides a perspective on how quantum criticality shapes the dynamics of strongly correlated metals and superconductors.</p>

            <p>Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</p>

We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</p>

In the regime of truly long-range interactions (small fall-off rate), optimizing over local unitary operations, while retaining the local measurement scheme in the original measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) set-up, enables the scheme to achieve nonclassical average fidelities. Specifically, we identify a threshold fall-off rate of the interaction above which the fidelity of both universal single- and two-qubit gates consistently exceeds $90\%$ accuracy. Moreover, we exhibit that the gate-implementation protocol remains robust under two realistic imperfections -- noise in the measurement process, modeled via unsharp measurements, and disorder in the interaction strengths. These findings confirm WGS produced through long-range systems as a resilient and effective resource for MBQC.</p>

            <h2>Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Divic, Valentin Crépel, Tomohiro Soejima, Xue-Yang Song, Andrew Millis, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moiré materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</p>

            <h2>Non-Fermi Liquids from Subsystem Symmetry Breaking in van der Waals Multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archisman Panigrahi, Ajesh Kumar</p>
            <p>We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically $C\sim T (\log(1/T))^2$.</p>

            <h2>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</p>

In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Masaki Oshikawa, Yizhi You</p>
            <p>We introduce a holographic framework for the entanglement Hamiltonian in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with area-law entanglement, whose reduced density matrix $\rho \propto e^{-H_e}$ can be treated as a lower-dimensional mixed state. By replicating $\rho$, we reconstruct the fixed-point SPT wavefunction, establishing an exact correspondence between the bulk strange correlator of the (d+1)-dimensional SPT state and the twisted Rényi-N operator of the d-dimensional reduced density matrix. Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted Rényi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems. Finally, we extend our protocol to mixed-state SPT phases and introduce new quantum information metrics -- twisted Rényi-N correlators of the surgery operator -- to characterize the topology of mixed states.</p>

            <h2>Worldline deconfinement and emergent long-range interaction in entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Dao-Xin Yao, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>When a system exhibits a bulk gap but gapless edge states (e.g., a symmetry-protected topological phase), the entanglement spectrum (ES) resembles the energy spectrum on virtual edge, that is the Li-Haldane conjecture. In this way, the ES plays an important probe to detect the topological phases according to this bulk-edge correspondence. When a system is fully gapped, both in bulk and edge, the ES still remains similar to the virtual edge spectrum which can be explained by the recently proposed wormhole effect in the path integral of reduced density matrix. However, what will happen in the ES when the system is fully gapless? We find that though the ES roughly seems like an edge energy spectrum, and it actually contains relevant long-range interaction which modifies the intrinsic physics of entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). Moreover, the mechanism of short-/long-range interaction in EH can be understood as the confinement/deconfinement of worldlines in a path integral of reduced density matrix. Our work demonstrates that the gapless mode can induce a long-range interaction in EH.</p>

            <p>We identify a "twin-twist" angle in orthorhombic two-dimensional magnets that maximizes interlayer orbital overlap and enables strong interfacial coupling. Focusing on the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr, we show that this twist angle, near 72 deg, aligns diagonal lattice vectors across the layers, enhancing the interlayer hopping that is spin-forbidden in pristine systems and orbital-forbidden in 90-deg-twisted samples. The enhanced hopping modifies the electronic structure and activates a novel mechanism for excitation of interfacial magnons. Using optical probes we discover that excitons on one side of the interface selectively excite magnons localized on the opposite side. We show that this cross-coupling phenomenon can be understood as a consequence of the spin-transfer torque as that arises as electrons tunnel across the twin-twisted interface. Our findings demonstrate that large-angle twisting in anisotropic 2D materials offers a powerful tool for engineering spin and charge transport through controlled interlayer hybridization, opening new avenues for twisted magnetism and strongly correlated moiré physics.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous emission and Purcell effect: some aspects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. P. Abrantes, D. Szilard, C. Farina</p>
            <p>This chapter, part of the Proceedings of the III International Workshop on Quantum Nonstationary Systems (eds. Alexandre Dodonov and Lucas Chibebe Celeri), held in Brasilia in August 2024, offers a comprehensive overview of spontaneous emission (SE) and the Purcell effect within the broader context of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and vacuum fluctuations. It begins with a historical and theoretical review, tracing the development of classical and quantum electromagnetic theories. The chapter then examines how the SE rate of a quantum emitter is fundamentally influenced by its electromagnetic environment, the so-called Purcell effect, through canonical examples, such as emitters near perfectly conducting plates and inside cavities, as well as more advanced scenarios. Special attention is given to modern strategies for tailoring SE using engineered environments, including plasmonic cloaks, composite media near percolation thresholds, metal-insulator phase transitions, and strain-induced modulation in phosphorene. Analytical techniques, such as mode summation and Green's function formalism, are employed to describe how surrounding materials and boundary conditions affect local field modes and the local density of states. The findings underscore both the theoretical depth and experimental relevance of SE modulation, paving the way for innovations in nano-optics, quantum technologies, and advanced material design.</p>

            <p>The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena Using Floquet formalism, we reveal multiple spin-degenerate nodes in the Floquet spin density, which can be dissected into single- and double-photon processes, and connected to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Notably, both odd- and even-frequency spin-triplet pairs can be generated by the interplay between the driving field and the unconventional magnetism. Moreover, the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of the unconventional magnet allows linearly polarized light to control magnetic and polarization directions. By tuning the driving amplitude, frequency, and polarization, Floquet spin density and pairing amplitude can be dynamically controlled, offering promising applications in Floquet engineering spintronic and superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>Nontrivial topology in type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$ leading to topologically protected surface states give rise to fascinating phenomena holding great promise for next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. Key parameters $-$ such as lattice parameter, disorder, vacancies, and electron correlation $-$ significantly influence the electronic structure and, subsequently, the physical properties. To resolve the discrepancy between the theoretical description and experimentally observed topological surface states, we comprehensively investigate the electronic structure of NiTe$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. Although the bulk electronic structure is found to be well-described within mean field approaches, an accurate description of topological surface states is obtained only by incorporating surface electronic correlation. We reveal that the strongly correlated surface states forming Dirac-like conical crossing much below Fermi level have hybridized Ni 3$d$ and Te 5$p$ character. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between electron correlation and band topology, broadening our understanding of many-body correlation effects on the topological surface states in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the Néel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the Néel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.</p>

            <p>Néel vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of Néel vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that Néel vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. The consequent asymmetric spin torque leads to Néel vector dynamics fundamentally different from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced Néel vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

The epitaxial growth of Pb monolayers on SiC(0001), combined with the relatively large spacing of the suspended graphene, makes this system particularly distinctive. Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques -- including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) -- we have investigated the intercalation process across multiple length scales. Our analysis reveals the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight the potential of graphene as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.</p>

B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarizationtensor. According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</p>

            <p>We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</p>

In a single continuous run, our routine identifies spin qubits at 12 distinct charge transitions in under 17 hours. Beyond tuning, our routine autonomously acquires data revealing the gate-voltage dependence of the exchange interaction, dephasing time, and quality factor -- quantities that vary substantially between charge configurations.

            <p>The work investigates the failure modes of the microstructure of an irregular ceramic foam subjected to uniaxial compression loading. The foam material is manufactured using the direct foaming method and has polydispersed pores homogeneously distributed in the microstructure. The effective stress-strain curve and the macroscopic strength of the material differs significantly with the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby model that assumes a regular microstructure. The objective of this work is to determine the reasons. The work builds upon an image segmentation algorithm that utilizes a skeletonization method followed by geometric pruning strategies to isolate the struts in the foam microstructure. In this work, a novel pruning strategy defined by a physics-based significance measure is proposed, which identifies the struts whose failure leads to macroscopic failure of the material. The stresses in the struts are calculated by a finite element simulation, which is then utilized to determine their failure modes. This also reveals the relationship between the strut orientation and their failure this http URL energy dissipated by the individual failure modes as the loading is increased shows that there are two dominant modes which are different from the bending failure reported in the Gibson-Ashby model. These failure modes are mixed compression-tension and pure compression.</p>

            <p>In topological physics, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the presence of topological boundary states, accurately predicted by the well-established bulk-edge correspondence. For example, in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, Fermi arcs emerge to connect projected Weyl points on the surface due to inheriting the bulk-edge correspondence from the integer quantum Hall effect. However, limited attention has been paid to exploring the reverse mechanism in topological crystals. In this study, we propose that boundaries can serve as an alternative degree of freedom to manipulate topological bulk transports. We analytically and experimentally validate our concept using a finite-thickness photonic meta-crystal that supports bulk nodal lines, with its zeroth modes exhibiting opposite chiral bulk transports under different boundary conditions. Notably, the mirror symmetry remains preserved across both configurations. These findings are applicable to other topological systems, providing new insights into systems with varied boundary conditions and offering the potential for the design of more compact and spatially efficient topological photonic devices.</p>

            <p>In densely-packed two-dimensional systems of growing cells, such as rod-shaped bacteria, a number of experimental and numerical studies report distinct patterns of nematic orientational order in the presence of confinement. So far, these effects have been explained using variations of growing active nematic continuum theories, which incorporate feedback between growth-induced active stresses, the resulting material flow and nematic orientation, and were adapted to the specific geometry under investigation. Here, we first show that a direct, analytical prediction of orientation patterns based on a simple isotropic-growth assumption and the shear rate tensor of the expansion flow already covers previously observed cases. We use this method to tune orientation patterns and net topological defect charge in a systematic way using domain geometry, confirmed by agent-based simulations. We then show how this framework can be extended to quantitatively capture alignment strength, and explore its potential for cross-prediction across different geometries. Our simplified and unifying theoretical framework highlights the role of domain geometry in shaping nematic order of growing systems, and thereby provides a way to forward-engineer desired orientation patterns.</p>

Intrinsic defect calculations indicate that Cr interstitials and oxygen vacancies dominate under Cr-rich conditions, whereas Cr vacancies prevail under O-rich conditions. Notably, under Cr-rich conditions, the Fermi level can be pinned slightly above mid-gap due to the formation of Cr interstitials and oxygen vacancies. To assess the influence of dopant on $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of Cr$_2$O$_3$, we calculate the enhancement of the exchange energy for the spin on the dopant site or on adjacent Cr site using the supercell method. Our study identifies isovalent Mo and W substitution on Cr site as the most promising candidates to increase Néel temperature due to the impurity-mediated enhanced exchange interaction for half-filled bands. Formation energy calculations indicate that Mo and W substitution on Cr are easier to form under Cr-rich conditions and a Fermi level near or slightly above the midgap renders a desirable neutral Mo and W defect. This is assisted by the formation of intrinsic Cr interstitial and O vacancy under Cr-rich conditions. These findings offer a route to utilize defects for higher $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and enhanced performance of Cr$_2$O$_3$ in magnetoelectric devices and furnish invaluable insights for directing subsequent experimental endeavors.</p>

            <h2>Exact zero modes in the interacting Majorana X- and Y-junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rik Mulder, Bowy M. La Rivière, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>We report the appearance of exact zero modes in junctions of interacting Majorana wires. We consider two, three and four short Majorana chains coupled to each other at one edge and forming a longer chain with an impurity bond, Y- and X- junctions correspondingly. The exact zero modes emerge as a result of incommensurate short-range correlations resulting from interacting Majorana fermions and manifest themselves as unavoided crossing of energy levels of in-gap states continuously tuned by hopping and interaction strength. For the Y- and X-junctions, we detect four in-gap states that are clearly visible below the bulk excitations. In the X-junction, the energy levels cross pairwise; in the Y-junction, the crossings happen simultaneously in all four levels. We argue that this peculiarity is a result of fractional degrees of freedom localized at the center of junctions with an odd number of arms, which mediate the interaction of the outer edge states. Furthermore, we show that zero modes in multiple-arm junctions can be effectively modeled by a single chain with a strong impurity bond.</p>

            <h2>Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: an emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando A. Garcia, Sushma Kumari, Juan Schmidt, Cris Adriano, Aashish Sapkota, Paul C. Canfield, Rebecca Flint, Raquel A. Ribeiro</p>
            <p>Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials is a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</p>

            <h2>Physics-informed Machine Learning Analysis for Nanoscale Grain Mapping by Synchrotron Laue Microdiffraction</h2>

            <p>Understanding the grain morphology, orientation distribution, and crystal structure of nanocrystals is essential for optimizing the mechanical and physical properties of functional materials. Synchrotron X-ray Laue microdiffraction is a powerful technique for characterizing crystal structures and orientation mapping using focused X-rays. However, when grain sizes are smaller than the beam size, mixed peaks in the Laue pattern from neighboring grains limit the resolution of grain morphology mapping. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) approach that combines a CNN feature extractor with a physics-informed filtering algorithm to overcome the spatial resolution limits of X-rays, achieving nanoscale resolution for grain mapping. Our PIML method successfully resolves the grain size, orientation distribution, and morphology of Au nanocrystals through synchrotron microdiffraction scans, showing good agreement with electron backscatter diffraction results. This PIML-assisted synchrotron microdiffraction analysis can be generalized to other diffraction-based probes, enabling the characterization of nanosized structures with micron-sized probes.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.</p>

            <h2>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Huang, Seth Musser, Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, et. al., arXiv:2504.06972 which displays a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at a filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a magnetic phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a phase with zero Chern number, potentially corresponding to an inter-valley coherent state. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have an inter-valley coherent normal state.</p>

            <p>Composition-temperature phase diagrams are crucial for designing ferroelectric materials, however predicting them accurately remains challenging due to limited phase transformation data and the constraints of conventional methods. Here, we utilize natural language processing (NLP) to text-mine 41,597 research articles, compiling a dataset of 2,838 phase transformations across 846 ferroelectric materials. Leveraging this dataset, we develop FerroAI, a deep learning model for phase diagram prediction. FerroAI successfully predicts phase boundaries and transformations among different crystal symmetries in Ce/Zr co-doped BaTiO$3$ (BT)-$x$Ba${0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$TiO$_3$ (BCT). It also identifies a morphotropic phase boundary in Zr/Hf co-doped BT-$x$BCT at $x = 0.3$, guiding the discovery of a new ferroelectric material with an experimentally measured dielectric constant of 9535. These results establish FerroAI as a powerful tool for phase diagram construction, guiding the design of high-performance ferroelectric materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Gorsky</p>
            <p>The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Chernodub</p>
            <p>We study SU($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory in $1+1$ dimensions at finite temperature on a spatial ring that rotates uniformly in a plane. We show that the effect of rotation results only in a simple kinematic enhancement of the gauge coupling $g$, which becomes rescaled by a Lorentz factor corresponding to the tangential rotational velocity of the ring. Using well-established analytic results in Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit of an infinite number of colors, we demonstrate that the moment of inertia of the large-$N_c$ gluon plasma on the ring is negative. This counterintuitive conclusion is, however, in agreement with recent first-principle numerical simulations of hot $3+1$ dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that also reported a negative moment of inertia for gluon plasma in an experimentally relevant window of temperatures above the deconfinement transition. Furthermore, we argue that our picture provides a qualitative explanation for three other intriguing features observed in lattice simulations of vortical QCD: the emergence of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed phase, the inconsistency of its spatial structure with a standard picture dictated by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law, and the enhancement of the critical deconfining temperature by rotation.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable fixed point subjected to stochastic control. The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.</p>

            <p>Quantum observables in the form of few-point correlators are the key to characterizing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>Nanogaps are ubiquitous across science, confining molecules and thus changing chemistries which influence many areas such as catalysis, corrosion, photochemistry, and sensing. However in ambient conditions, it is unclear how water solvates nanogaps and even if nominally dry, what water structure persists. Despite its low Raman cross-section, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables study of water at coinage metal surfaces. Using multi-layer aggregates of close-packed gold nanoparticles with sub-nanometre gaps precisely defined by organic spacer molecules, we achieve consistent and large SERS enhancements, enabling systematic study of water within these confined spaces. Ostensibly dry facets in air evidence water monolayer coatings, with hydrogen-bonding only reappearing upon immersion in solution. Under negative applied potentials, surface water is seen to re-orient at the metal facets with distinct spectral shifts among the quartet of vibrational peaks which correspond to those expected from water dimers. Comparing nanogaps in deuterated water also reveals how individual water molecules bind onto organic spacer molecules in such nanogaps. Realistic models of water dressing will enable better understanding of catalytic and contact chemistries.</p>

            <p>Characterization of dispersion surfaces (DS) in photonic crystals (PhCs) can predict striking topological features, such as bound states in the continuum (BICs). Precise measurement of dispersion, particularly near the {\Gamma}-point, is crucial since even subtle geometric deviations significantly impact the distribution of topological charges and associated polarization singularities. Here, we propose a novel technique to measure DS of PhC slabs with high angular accuracy of up to 3 x 10^(-4) radians, and spectral accuracy of 0.2 nm within an expanded region of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, our technique is diffraction- and aberration-free as it does not rely on optical imaging but rather on spectral mapping. The analysis of DS presented in this work demonstrates the robustness of our technique, and enables us to distinguish anisotropic BICs along a specific symmetry axis from isotropic states around the {\Gamma}-point. Moreover, the experimental DS obtained supply the information necessary to study and identify super-BICs.</p>

The modified electromagnetic environment offered by the WSe2 waveguide alters MoTe2 spontaneous emission, a phenomenon we directly image with our interferometric nano-photoluminescence technique. We captured spatially-oscillating nanoscale patterns prompted by spontaneous emission from MoTe2 into waveguide modes of WSe2 slabs. We quantify the resulting Purcell-enhanced emission rate within the framework of a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) model, relating the MoTe2 spontaneous emission rate to the measured waveguide dispersion.

            <p>Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that embeds the Schrödinger equation directly into the machine learning procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit in certain settings and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</p>

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that these quantities are new useful probes of quantum critical points by examining concrete examples. In particular, we compute the multi-entropy and dihedral measures in the $1+1$ dimensional massless free scalar field theory on a lattice and in the transverse-field Ising model. For $n=2$, we find that the numerical results in both lattice theories quantitatively agree with those from conformal field theoretic calculations. For $n=3$ and $n=4$, we provide new predictions of these measures for the massless scalar field theory.</p>

            <p>Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population to a cooperative state.</p>

Finite-field methods are one of most reliable approaches for modeling electrochemical interfaces in complete cells under realistic constant-potential conditions. However, previous finite-field studies have been limited to either expensive ab initio molecular dynamics or less accurate classical descriptions of electrodes and electrolytes. To overcome these limitations, we present a machine learning-based finite-field approach that combines two neural network models: one predicts atomic forces under applied electric fields, while the other describes the corresponding charge response. Both models are trained entirely on first-principles data without employing any classical approximations. As a proof-of-concept demonstration in a prototypical Au(100)/NaCl(aq) system, this approach not only dramatically accelerates fully first-principles finite-field simulations but also successfully extrapolates to cell potentials beyond the training range while accurately predicting key electrochemical properties. Interestingly, we reveal a turnover of both density and orientation distributions of interfacial water molecules at the anode, arising from competing interactions between the positively charged anode and adsorbed Cl$^-$ ions with water molecules as the applied potential increases. This novel computational scheme shows great promise in efficient first-principles modelling of large-scale electrochemical interfaces under potential control.</p>

            <h2>Hessian Geometry of Latent Space in Generative Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Lobashev, Dmitry Guskov, Maria Larchenko, Mikhail Tamm</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models, by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

            <p>We present a new approach to quantity urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.</p>

            <h2>Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling hypothesis in the Google analog-digital quantum simulator of the $XX$ model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yintai Zhang, Francis A. Bayocboc Jr., Jacek Dziarmaga</p>
            <p>The state-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the 2D square-lattice $XX$ model [Nature 638, 79 (2025)]. We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.</p>

            <h2>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Matteo Magoni, Hannes Pichler</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that towers of exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle excitation that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoucheng Wang, Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin, Li Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the supercritical crossovers for black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical regime beyond the critical point, where small and large black holes are indistinguishable from the conventional viewpoint. We establish a refined supercritical phase diagram that comprehensively characterizes small, large, and indistinguishable black hole phases, whose boundaries are defined by two supercritical crossover lines. The universal scaling laws of the two crossover lines are fully verified using black hole thermodynamics in both the standard consideration and the extended thermodynamic phase space by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. Remarkable analogies are observed when the supercritical phase diagrams of the two frameworks of black holes are compared to those corresponding to liquid-gas and liquid-liquid phase transitions. The present study can be extended to a variety of more complicated black hole backgrounds and provide valuable insights into the fundamental nature of black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</h2>

            <p>The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Chattopadhyay, Avijit Misra, Tanmoy Pandit, Goutam Paul</p>
            <p>According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environment in the quantum regime where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent exploration toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also review the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.</p>

            <p>In this note, we study two-point correlation functions of modular Hamiltonians. We show that in general quantum systems, these correlators obey properties similar to those of von Neumann entropy and capacity of entanglement, both of which are special cases of these correlators. Then we specialize to two spacelike-separated spherical subregions in conformal field theories. We present direct computations of the vacuum two-point function that confirm its equivalence to the stress-tensor conformal block. We explore the two-point function in various kinematic regimes, including imaginary time separation between subsystems. The material presented in this note may be useful for further studying modular Hamiltonian correlators in generic quantum systems and in conformal field theories, including those with holographic duals.</p>

            <p>Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</p>

            <h2>Experimental investigation of the flow rate--pressure drop relation of a viscoelastic Boger fluid in a deformable channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SungGyu Chun, Ivan C. Christov, Jie Feng</p>
            <p>We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for microfluidic system design involving complex fluids.</p>

            <h2>Random site percolation thresholds on square lattice for complex neighborhoods containing sites up to the sixth coordination zone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Malarz (AGH University of Krakow)</p>
            <p>The site percolation problem is one of the core topics in statistical physics. Evaluation of the percolation threshold, which separates two phases (sometimes described as conducting and insulating), is useful for a range of problems from core condensed matter to interdisciplinary application of statistical physics in epidemiology or other transportation or connectivity problems. In this paper with Newman--Ziff fast Monte Carlo algorithm and finite-size scaling theory the random site percolation thresholds $p_c$ for a square lattice with complex neighborhoods containing sites from the sixth coordination zone are computed. Complex neighborhoods are those that contain sites from various coordination zones (which are not necessarily compact). We also present the source codes of the appropriate procedures (written in C) to be replaced in original Newman--Ziff code. Similar to results previously found for the honeycomb lattice, the percolation thresholds for complex neighborhoods on a square lattice follow the power law $p_c(\zeta)\propto\zeta^{-\gamma_2}$ with $\gamma_2=0.5454(60)$, where $\zeta=\sum_i z_i r_i$ is the weighted distance of sites in complex neighborhoods ($r_i$ and $z_i$ are the distance from the central site and the number of sites in the coordination zone $i$, respectively).</p>

            <p>We show that exceptional points (EPs) and non-Hermitian behavior can emerge dynamically in impurity models with Hermitian microscopic origins. Using perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis, Fock-space diagonalization, and spin-spin relaxation time calculations, we demonstrate that nonlinear (NL) dispersion and anisotropic pseudochiral (PC) interactions generate complex fixed points and spectral defectiveness. The effective Kondo model features a square-root RG invariant linking planar and longitudinal Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya (DM) couplings, driving the onset of EPs. Our analysis reveals dissipative fixed points stabilized by an emergent Lie algebra structure and a scaling collapse in relaxation dynamics. Across both single- and two-impurity extensions, we identify a universal ``sign-reversion'' (SR) regime near critical NL coupling, where anisotropy preserves PC symmetry and SR serves as a signature of non-Hermitian flow. These results establish a new class of non-Hermitian criticality generated through RG evolution in otherwise Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>The low kinetic friction between ice and numerous counterbodies is commonly attributed to an interfacial water layer, which is believed to originate from pre-existing surface water or from melt water induced by high contact pressures or frictional heat. However, even the currently leading theory of frictional melting appears to defy direct experimental verification. Here we present molecular simulations of ice interfaces that reveal that ice surfaces liquefy without melting thermodynamically but predominantly by cold, displacement-driven amorphization. Despite effective self-lubrication, very small ice friction is found to require water to slip past a hydrophobic counterface -- or an excess amount of water, produced by, e.g., extreme sliding velocities.</p>

            <p>We uncover a new origin of the planar Hall effect - as an intrinsic property of layer coherent electrons - that exists even in bilayer and trilayer atomically thin limit. It reforms the existing theories requiring three-dimensional orbital motion, or strong spin-orbit coupling of certain forms, which are absent in van der Waals thin films. We exemplify that the effect can be triggered by strain and interlayer sliding in twisted structures with rich tunability and strong magnitudes. Furthermore, this layer coherence mechanism broadens the conceptual framework to include planar multipole Hall effect, and valley Hall effect induced by in-plane pseudo-magnetic field, outreaching the existing mechanisms. The layer mechanism also provides a new route towards quantized Hall response upon a topological phase transition induced by in-plane magnetic field. These results unveil the unexplored potential of quantum layertronics and moiré flat band for planar transport in 2D materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Li, Hong-Fang Song, Hao-Jie Xu, Yu-Liang Sun, Fuqiang Wang</p>
            <p>Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies require an intense phase of multiple interactions between the created particles. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\sqrt{n_{\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</p>

            <p>The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</p>

            <p>Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</p>

            <p>We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schrödinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that their tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters. Recently, it has been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models of this type map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve a class of integrable LZ models with hyperbolic time dependence, $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$, for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices.</p>

            <p>Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to rate-dependent. Current fracture toughness measures are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to specific pre-cracked geometries. There is no generally agreed-upon model for the fracture of soft polymers. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work can be used as a measure of fracture resistance in soft polymers. We develop a damage model to predict fracture in soft polymers. In the model, the energetic part of the critical stress work is proposed as a damage initiation criterion that has the ability to capture failure surfaces. The damage growth is modeled through a generalized gradient-damage framework. The fracture model is validated for both elastomers and viscous soft polymers by comparing model predictions against experimental results for different materials (ethylene propylene diene monomer - EPDM, EPS25 vitrimer, styrene butadiene rubber - SBR, natural rubber - NR, and polyborosiloxane - PBS), a variety of specimen geometries, and loading conditions. The model can predict key physical phenomena such as brittle and ductile responses and different fracture profiles. The microstructural quantities, such as subchain dissociation energy during the fracture of polymers, can be predicted from the macroscopic model parameters.</p>

            <p>We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding the energy of visible light, thereby limiting their photovoltaic performance. SbSI, featuring a visible-range band gap, combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. Our calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct spin textures, relevant for spintronics applications. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting high photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it serves as a diagnostic tool to identify the material phase, with the circular photogalvanic effect reflecting spin texture changes. Thanks to its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising candidate for solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.</p>

            <p>Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</p>

            <h2>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das</p>
            <p>Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for studying many-body physics and interactions between the system and measurement fields. A key challenge is identifying appropriate quasiparticle states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating the phase space as a manifold, we embed a real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore the unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation in phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We validate the model on the square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT), revealing the coexistence of nodeless $s^{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</p>

            <h2>Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Túnica, Perpetua Wanjiru Muchiri, Alberto Zobelli, Anna Marzegalli, Emilio Scalise, Michele Amato</p>
            <p>Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. Understanding and modulating the interaction between these extended defects and dopants are essential for advancing the design and performance of these novel semiconductors. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near the I$_3$-type defect.</p>

            <h2>Functional interpolation expansion for nonequilibrium correlated impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Werner, Enrico Arrigoni</p>
            <p>We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.</p>

            <h2>Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular powders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasco C. Braz, Nuno A. M. Araújo</p>
            <p>When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders</p>

            <h2>Universal Bound States with Bose-Fermi Duality in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingting Shi, Haitian Wang, Xiaoling Cui</p>
            <p>We investigate universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold polar molecules. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models. These models well reproduce the tetratomic (two-molecule) bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find the lowest bound state emerge concurrently with tetratomic state, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, all these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality, i.e., they share identical energies and spatial densities in both bosonic and fermionic molecular systems. Universal features of these bound states are supported by the 1D nature of effective scattering and a large repulsive core in the reduced effective potential. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Conduction Band Structure and Ultrafast Dynamics of Ferroelectric $α$-GeTe(111)</h2>

            <p>$\alpha$-GeTe(111) is a non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric (FE) material for which a significative lattice distortion combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction gives rise to giant Rashba split states in the bulk and at the surface, which have been intensively probed in the occupied valence states using static angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Nevertheless, its unoccupied conduction band structure remains unexplored, in particular the experimental determination of its electronic band gap across momentum space. Using time-resolved ARPES based on high-repetition rate and extreme ultraviolet femtosecond (fs) laser, we unveil the band structure of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) in the full Brillouin zone, both in the valence and conduction states, as well as the exploration of its out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Our work confirms the semiconducting nature of $\alpha$-GeTe(111) with a 0.85 eV indirect band gap, which provides an upper limit for comparison to density functional theory calculations. We finally reveal the dominant scattering mechanisms of photoexcited carriers during the out-of-equilibrium dynamics under fs light pulses.</p>
