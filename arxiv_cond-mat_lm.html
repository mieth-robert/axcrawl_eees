            <h2>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeet Shah, Gautam Nambiar, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</p>

            <h2>Reallocation of Nonlocal Entanglement in Incommensurate Cold Atom Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jemin Park, Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>Cold atom arrays in optical lattices offer a highly tunable platform for exploring complex quantum phenomena that are difficult to realize in conventional materials. Here, we investigate the emergence of controllable long-range quantum correlations in a simulated twisted bilayer structure with fermionic cold atoms. By exploiting the incommensurate nature of the twisted bilayer, we observe a significant enhancement of long-range susceptibility, suggesting the formation of stable entangled states between spatially distant localized spins. We further show that the tunability of the interlayer coupling in terms of driving fields enables us to manipulate these entangled states without deformation of lattice structure and extra doping. Our findings provide a pathway for overcoming challenges in establishing strong correlations across distant sites, highlighting the potential of optical lattices as a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Robust trapping of 2D excitons in an engineered 1D potential from proximal ferroelectric domain walls</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Soubelet, Yao Tong, Asier Astaburuaga Hernandez, Peirui Ji, Katia Gallo, Andreas V. Stier, Jonathan J. Finley</p>
            <p>We investigate the confinement of neutral excitons in a one-dimensional (1D) potential, engineered by proximizing hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoSe$_2$ to ferroelectric domain walls (DW) in periodically poled LiNbO$_3$. Our device exploits the nanometer scale in-plane electric field gradient at the DW to induce the dipolar exciton confinement via the Stark effect. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals the emergence of narrow emission lines redshifted from the MoSe$_2$ neutral exciton by up to $\sim100\,$meV, depending on the sample structure. The spatial distribution, excitation energy response and polarization properties of the emission is consistent with signatures of 1D-confined excitons. The large electric field gradients accessible via proximal ferroelectric systems open up new avenues for the creation of robust quantum-confined excitons in atomically thin materials and their heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Schmid-Higgs Mode in the Presence of Pair-Breaking Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Dzero, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Collective modes in superconductors provided the first realization of the Higgs mechanism. The transverse Goldstone mode acquires a gap (i.e. a mass) when it hybridizes with the electromagnetic gauge field. The longitudinal Schmid-Higgs mode, on the other hand, is always massive. In conventional BCS theory, its gap is exactly $2\Delta$, coinciding with the excitation threshold for quasiparticles. Being situated right at the edge of the continuum spectrum it gives rise to peculiar dynamics for the Schmid-Higgs mode. For instance, when suddenly excited at $t=0$, it exhibits algebraically decaying oscillations of the form $\sim \sin(2\Delta t)/{t}^{1/2}$. In this study, we explore the behavior of Schmid-Higgs oscillations in the presence of pair-breaking mechanisms, such as magnetic impurities or in-plane magnetic fields. These processes suppress the quasiparticle excitation threshold down to $2\varepsilon_g < 2\Delta$, potentially placing the longitudinal mode within the continuum spectrum. Despite this, we show that the algebraically decaying oscillations persist, taking the form $\sim \sin(2\varepsilon_g t)/t^2$. The Schmid-Higgs mode becomes truly overdamped and exponentially decaying only in the gapless superconductors with $\varepsilon_g=0$.</p>

            <h2>Planckian dissipation, anomalous high temperature THz non-linear response and energy relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dipanjan Chaudhuri, David Barbalas, Fahad Mahmood, Jiahao Liang, Ralph Romero III, Anaelle Legros, Xi He, Helene Raffy, Ivan Bozovic, N.P. Armitage</p>
            <p>We have investigated the nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopic response of superconducting La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) thin films as a function of $T$ across a wide range of doping levels from mildly underdoped through extremely overdoped ($T_c < 5$ K). In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in the superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz nonlinearity. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional superconductor NbN where the strong nonlinear response promptly disappears at $T_c$. The size of the nonlinear susceptibility in LSCO is $|\chi^{(3)}|\approx 2.2\times10^{-9} m^2/V^2$, which is one of the largest THz range nonlinearities ever measured. The 2DCS measurement shows that the dominant normal state nonlinearities arise from pump-probe processes, of which there are various possible origins. These may be related to the unconventional interactions that lead to the strange metal or the persistence of superconducting correlations to high temperatures. Irrespective of its origin, the large normal state nonlinearity provides an opportunity to measure the energy relaxation rate ($\Gamma_E$) to temperatures where the momentum relaxation rate is linear in T and close to its ``Planckian" form ($\Gamma_M \approx 2kT/h$). We find $\Gamma_E$ to be $10 - 40$ times smaller than the momentum relaxation. This shows that the scattering that causes momentum loss (and $T$-linear) resistivity do not remove appreciable energy from the electrons. Although the $T$-dependence of the momentum relaxation is consistent with quasi-elastic scattering off bosonic collective modes at temperatures above their characteristic energy (the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature for acoustic phonons) it is inconsistent with $\Gamma_E$'s temperature dependence. $\Gamma_E$ is an increasing function of $T$, which is indicative of {\it inelastic} scattering to the phonon bath.</p>

            <h2>Angular Interplay of Nematicity, Superconductivity, and Strange Metallicity in a Moir√© Flat Band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naiyuan J. Zhang, Pavel A. Nosov, Ophelia Evelyn Sommer, Yibang Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Eslam Khalaf, J.I.A. Li</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems frequently exhibits broken rotational symmetry, raising fundamental questions about the underlying order parameter symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This work introduces a new paradigm for probing the microscopic mechanisms governing superconductivity in strongly interacting two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Low-lying Electronic Structure of Rare-Earth Based Topological Nodal Line Semimetal Candidate DySbTe</h2>

            <p>Lanthanide (Ln) based LnSbTe materials have garnered significant attention due to rich interplay of long range magnetic ordering and topological properties, driven by unique crystalline symmetry, 4f electron interactions, and pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. DySbTe, as a heavier lanthanide-based member of the LnSbTe family, stands out with its SOC and larger on site interactions on its 4f electrons, which arise due to the heavier Dy element. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the low-temperature bulk physical properties and the electronic structure of DySbTe using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements, along with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), and density functional theory calculations. Our thermodynamic measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 7.45 K and a subsequent magnetic phase transition at TN1 = 7.15 K. Our transport studies indicate a semimetallic behavior with unusual feature in the ordered state. Our ARPES measurements revealed a diamond-shaped Fermi pocket centered at the G point, with band features that evolve distinctly across various binding energies. STM/S results indicate a minimum in the density of states at around 100 meV below the Fermi level, and ARPES measurements reveal a significant gap present around the X point, differentiating DySbTe from other LnSbTe compounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the SOC effects on the electronic structure and topological properties in the LnSbTe family, highlighting DySbTe as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between topology and magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Quantum skyrmions and antiskyrmions in monoaxial chiral magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Liscak, Andreas Haller, Andreas Michels, Thomas L. Schmidt, Vladyslav M. Kuchkin</p>
            <p>Classical monoaxial chiral magnets represent a unique magnetic system that allows for the stabilization of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions of equal energy. Unlike a similar situation in frustrated magnets, the energy landscape here is much simpler, consisting of four states: the saturated ferromagnetic state, spin-spiral, skyrmion, and antiskyrmion. This simplicity makes such systems interesting for potential applications that rely on manipulating these states. We study the quantum analog of the already established classical theory by investigating the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we establish that such a model supports the existence of skyrmion and antiskyrmion states of equal energy. This degeneracy allows for the existence of a mesoscopic Schr√∂dinger cat state exhibiting properties of both skyrmion and antiskyrmion. To characterize this superposition, we calculate two-point correlation functions that can be measured in neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we introduce a perturbation in the form of a magnetic field gradient to induce a non-trivial time evolution of the superposition state. We study this time evolution using both a numerical variational approach and the collective coordinates method.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling density of states in exotic superconductors and spatial patterns of particle-hole interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archisman Panigrahi, Vladislav Poliakov, Leonid Levitov</p>
            <p>Tunneling spectroscopy of superconductors provides valuable insights into gap symmetry, quasiparticle dynamics, and pairing mechanisms. This paper explores spatial patterns of quasiparticle interference in the tunneling density of states (TDOS) near localized impurities. These patterns emerge because Bogoliubov quasiparticles, as coherent superpositions of electrons and holes, drive reversible particle-to-hole conversion within the superconductor. Impurities act as beam splitters, generating interference between particle and hole states, forming spatial fringes reminiscent of Young's double-slit experiment. In topological superconductors, these interference patterns are further modulated by nodal lines that encode the nodal structure and phase of the gap function, $\Delta(\vec p)$. Notably, the patterns directly reveal the winding number of $\Delta(\vec p)$ phase, offering a unique probe of exotic, non-BCS pairing and a powerful tool for detecting topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Exciton Binding Energies in 2D Materials: Insights from Braneworld Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Honet, Micha√´l Sarrazin</p>
            <p>In the present work, we introduce a new interpretation of exciton binding energies in two-dimensional (2D) materials using concepts from brane physics. We adapt the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-Shifman mechanism to a (2+1)-dimensional brane in a (3+1)-D spacetime, deriving an effective electromagnetic potential on the brane. Using this potential, we develop a hydrogenic model for exciton binding energies in 2D materials, applying it to s-type excitons and comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results on WS$_{2}$ monolayers. This interdisciplinary approach bridges high-energy and condensed matter physics, offering a new didactic representation of excitons in low-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>Photonic Negative Differential Thermal Conductance Enabled by NIS Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Pioldi, G. De Simoni, A. Braggio, F. Giazotto</p>
            <p>Owing to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions are leveraged in various thermal devices. This study illustrates that two NISIN reservoirs can achieve a measurable negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC). This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under appropriate configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, leading to NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations where it is possible to discriminate this effect unambiguously. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges. This advances the development of devices that exploit NDTC to enhance heat and temperature regulation in cryogenic environments, such as thermal switches, transistors, and amplifiers.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinqi Chen, Constantin Schrade</p>
            <p>Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene has recently emerged as an exciting platform for a possible chiral superconducting state. Here, we theoretically demonstrate and study the emergence of nonreciprocal superconductivity and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect in this system. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism to superconductivity and show that large diode efficiencies, $\sim$ 60%, are achievable and highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we also find that the diodicity shows a characteristic angular dependence with multiple enhanced lobes, which depend on the Fermi surface structure of the underlying normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.</p>

            <h2>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayarshi Bhattacharya, Gautam Gangopadhyay, Sunandan Gangopadhyay</p>
            <p>This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Schindler, Philipp Strasberg, Niklas Galke, Andreas Winter, Michael G. Jabbour</p>
            <p>We introduce a definition of coarse-grained entropy that unifies measurement-based (observational entropy) and max-entropy-based (Jaynes) approaches to coarse-graining, by identifying physical constraints with information theoretic priors. The definition is shown to include as special cases most other entropies of interest in physics. We then consider second laws, showing that the definition admits new entropy increase theorems and connections to thermodynamics. We survey mathematical properties of the definition, and show it resolves some pathologies of the traditional observational entropy in infinite dimensions. Finally, we study the dynamics of this entropy in a quantum random matrix model and a classical hard sphere gas. Together the results suggest that this generalized observational entropy can form the basis of a highly general approach to statistical mechanics.</p>

We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.</p>

            <p>Information and free-energy maximization are physics principles that provide general rules for an agent to optimize actions in line with specific goals and policies. These principles are the building blocks for designing decision-making policies capable of efficient performance with only partial information. Notably, the information maximization principle has shown remarkable success in the classical bandit problem and has recently been shown to yield optimal algorithms for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian reward distributions. This article explores a broad extension of physics-based approaches to more complex and structured bandit problems. To this end, we cover three distinct types of bandit problems, where information maximization is adapted and leads to strong performance. Since the main challenge of information maximization lies in avoiding over-exploration, we highlight how information is tailored at various levels to mitigate this issue, paving the way for more efficient and robust decision-making strategies.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Interactions in Particle Suspensions: A Perspective on Stokesian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim William Torre, Joost de Graaf</p>
            <p>Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a numerical framework used for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particle suspensions at low Reynolds number. It combines far-field approximations with near-field lubrication corrections, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This work reviews SD and provides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the mathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the computational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively. We also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency, including the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition, we highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective approximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than made in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full many-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data. That is, we correct the RPY approximation, while avoiding costly matrix inversions. We demonstrate the potential of this method on a simple system, where we find a close match to SD data while algorithmically outperforming RPY. Our work provides an outlook on the way in which large-scale simulations of particle suspensions can be performed in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <h2>Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazhir Aliahmadi, Aidan Sheedy, Greg van Anders</p>
            <p>Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew N. Ivanov, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</p>

            <p>Networks of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are a promising material for thermoelectric energy harvesting due to their mechanical flexibility, solution processability, high Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities after chemical p- or n-doping. Here, we demonstrate that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) for electrolyte counterions is a promising method for p-doping of polymer-sorted semiconducting SWNT networks. The achieved doping levels, as determined from absorption bleaching, depend directly on both the pH of the aqueous doping solutions and the bandgap (i.e., diameter) of the nanotubes within the network. Fast screening of different nanotube networks under various doping conditions was enabled by a high-throughput setup for thermoelectric measurements of five samples in parallel. For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to reach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those obtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the electrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days in air. These results confirm PCET to be a suitable approach for more environmentally friendly and stable doping of semiconducting SWNTs as promising thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <h2>Modular transport in two-dimensional conformal field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mihail Mintchev, Diego Pontello, Erik Tonni</p>
            <p>We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density with the $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry associated to the conservation of the electric charge and of the helicity. The bipartition given by an interval is considered, either on the line or on the circle. The continuity equations and the corresponding conserved quantities for the modular flows of the currents and of the energy-momentum tensor are derived. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the modular quantum transport. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Tong Zhuang, Dario Rosenstock, Bao-Jie Liu, Aaron Somoroff, Vladimir E. Manucharyan, Chen Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that parasitic two-level systems (TLS) in superconducting qubits, which are a leading source of decoherence, can have relaxation times longer than the qubits themselves. However, the standard techniques used to characterize qubit relaxation is only valid for measuring $T_1$ under Markovian assumptions and could mask such non-Markovian behavior of the environment in practice. Here, we introduce two-timescale relaxometry, a technique to probe the qubit and environment relaxation simultaneously and efficiently. We apply it to high-coherence fluxonium qubits over a frequency range of 0.1-0.4 GHz, which reveals a discrete spectrum of TLS with millisecond lifetimes. Our analysis of the spectrum is consistent with a random distribution of TLS in the aluminum oxide tunnel barrier of the Josephson junction chain of the fluxonium with an average density and electric dipole similar to previous TLS studies at much higher frequencies. Our study suggests that investigating and mitigating TLS in the junction chain is crucial to the development of various types of noise-protected qubits in circuit QED.</p>

            <h2>First passage times in compact domains exhibit bi-scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talia Baravi, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>The study of first passage times for diffusing particles reaching target states is foundational in various practical applications, including diffusion-controlled reactions. In this work, we present a bi-scaling theory for the probability density function of first passage times in confined compact processes, applicable to both Euclidean and Fractal domains, diverse geometries, and scenarios with or without external force fields, accommodating Markovian and semi-Markovian random walks. In large systems, first passage time statistics exhibit a bi-scaling behavior, challenging the use of a single time scale. Our theory employs two distinct scaling functions: one for short times, capturing initial dynamics in unbounded systems, and the other for long times is sensitive to finite size effects. The combined framework provides a complete expression for first passage time statistics across all time scales.</p>

            <h2>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Garry Goldstein</p>
            <p>In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</p>

            <p>Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p>We present a novel approach to generate a fingerprint for crystalline materials that balances efficiency for machine processing and human interpretability, allowing its application in both machine learning inference and understanding of structure-property relationships. Our proposed material encoding has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the other characterizing the chemical composition, that we call Pettifor embedding. For the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. We show that the Pettifor embeddings systematically outperform other commonly used elemental embeddings in compositional machine learning models. Using the Pettifor embeddings to define a distance metric and applying dimension reduction techniques, we construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according to basic physical properties.</p>

            <p>Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here, we come up with a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.</p>

            <p>To study the size and strain rate dependency of copper polycrystalline microstructures, a multi-layered copper/Al$_2$O$_3$ thin film was deposited on a Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system (combining physical vapour and atomic layer deposition). High temperature treatment was applied on the ``As Deposited" material with ultrafine-grained structure to increase the average grain size, resulting in a ``Heat Treated" state with microcrystalline structure. Focused ion beam milling was employed to create square shaped micropillars with two different sizes, that were subjected to compressive loading at various (0.001/s -- 1000/s) strain rates. Differences in the strain rate sensitivity behavior manifesting at low and high strain rates are discussed in the context of the pillar diameters and the grain size of the deformed samples. The Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer studied by transmission electron microscopy showed excellent thermal stability and grain boundary pinning by precipitation, also resulting in the homogeneous deformation of the pillars and preventing shear localization. Geometrically necessary dislocation densities estimated by high (angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction presented inhomogeneous dislocation distribution within the deformed pillar volumes, that is attributed to the proximity of the sample edges. Finally, the Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayers successfully suppressed any possible recrystallization processes, contributing to the excellent film stability, that makes the proposed coating ideal to be operating under extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Foligno, Bruno Bertini</p>
            <p>The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Alja≈æ Godec</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</p>

            <p>In systems with unconventional Rashba bands, we propose that a finite-momentum pairing state can emerge without the need for an external magnetic field. We analyze the phase transition from a zero-momentum Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to a finite-momentum pairing state using a microscopic interaction model. We demonstrate that the coexistence of zero-momentum and Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type pairings in different channels provides a well understanding of recent experimental observations of pair-density-wave (PDW) states. Furthermore, we propose that an s-wave BCS superconductor-unconventional Rashba metal (SC-URM) junction can generate an LO-type pairing state via an orbital-selective proximity effect. This nontrivial state can be detected by measuring the Josephson current in an SC-URM-SC junction or through Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy/spectrosscopy (JSTM/S). Our results reveal that the internal multi-orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in facilitating finite-momentum pairing states.</p>

Flux creep is a phenomenon observed under the assumption that the material under study can trap magnetic flux, and thus, Fig. 4c serves as evidence that H$_{3}$S traps magnetic flux and is a high-temperature superconductor. The claim remains unchanged even in the recently published Author Correction [2] to Ref. [1]. However, Ref.

In this Matters Arising, we point out that the protocol is not applicable to H$_{3}$S under high pressure and propose an alternative protocol.

In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales.

            <p>Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</p>

            <p>Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</p>

            <p>This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</p>

            <p>In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</p>

It is observed that magnetic moments and M√∂ssbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.</p>

            <h2>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Ferrini, S.V. Koniakhin</p>
            <p>The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($Œ±$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rhea Hoyer, P. Peter Stavropoulos, Aleksandar Razpopov, Roser Valent√≠, Libor ≈†mejkal, Alexander Mook</p>
            <p>We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

            <p>We show that energy dissipation in slowly-driven, Markovian quantum systems at low temperature is linked to the geometry of the driving protocol through the quantum (or Fubini-Study) metric. Utilizing these findings, we establish lower bounds on dissipation rates in two-tone protocols, such as those employed for topological frequency conversion. Notably, in appropriate limits these bounds are only determined by the topology of the protocol and an effective quality factor of the system-bath coupling. Our results bridge topological and geometric phenomena with energy dissipation in open quantum systems, and further provide design principles for optimal driving protocols.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Zhang, Cai-Zhuang Wang, Thomas Iadecola, Peter P. Orth, Yong-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity in the Schr√∂dinger Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng-Zhang He, Hai-Qing Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the Krylov complexity of Schr√∂dinger field theories, focusing on both bosonic and fermionic systems within the grand canonical ensemble that includes a chemical potential. Krylov complexity measures operator growth in quantum systems by analyzing how operators spread within the Krylov space, a subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by successive applications of the superoperator $[H,\cdot]$ on an initial operator. Using the Lanczos algorithm, we construct an orthonormal Krylov basis and derive the Lanczos coefficients, which govern the operator connectivity and thus characterize the complexity. Our study reveals that the Lanczos coefficients $\{b_{n}\}$ are independent of the chemical potential, while $\{a_{n}\}$ exhibits a dependence on it. Both $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ show linear relationships with respect to $n$. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, the Krylov complexities behave similarly over time, especially at late times, due to the analogous profiles of the squared absolute values of their autocorrelation functions $\abs{\varphi_{0}(t)}^{2}$. The Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time, but its asymptotic scaling factor $\lambda_{K}$ is significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of the $\{b_{n}\}$ coefficients, contrasting to the relativistic field theories where the scaling aligns more closely with the twice of the slope of $\{b_{n}\}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nanako Shitara, Andr√©s Montoya-Castillo</p>
            <p>Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</p>

            <p>We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</p>

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</p>

            <p>Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyang Ma, Michael Kr√ºger</p>
            <p>Ultrafast science studies the dynamics of electrons in matter with extreme temporal precision, typically in the attosecond and femtosecond time domain. Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [Boyang Ma and Michael Kr√ºger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236901 (2024)], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter $\zeta$ that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\zeta > 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. $\zeta < 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.</p>

This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser.

We find that the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity diverges in the dc limit in a robust way against dissipation when the system is superconducting, suggesting that the supercurrent flows perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. This superconducting nonlinear Hall effect (SNHE) is demonstrated for the Haldane model with attractive interaction and its variant with pair hoppings. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the SNHE can be understood as those arising from a higher-order Lifshitz invariant, that is, a symmetry invariant constructed from order parameters that contains an odd number of spatial derivatives. We perform real-time simulations including the effect of collective modes for the models driven by a multi-cycle pulse, and show that the SNHE leads to large rectification of the Hall current under light driving.</p>

            <p>Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-√•ngstr√∂m and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz Dyksik, Michal Baranowski, Joshua J. P. Thompson, Zhuo Yang, Martha Rivera Medina, Maria Antonietta Loi, Ermin Malic, Paulina Plochocka</p>
            <p>A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimo Pressler, Daniel R. Gamelin</p>
            <p>Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique windows into the properties of strongly correlated electrons. Their generation can be used to drive magnetic phase transitions, manipulate spins coherently, or access novel non-equilibrium regimes. Despite extensive investigation into the spin physics of CrI3, exciton dynamics in this archetypal magnetic 2D material remain underexplored. Here, we report the use of Yb3+ impurity point defects as exciton annihilators to probe exciton diffusion in CrI3. Variable-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements for a series of x% Yb3+:CrI3 samples reveal thermally activated Dexter-type site-to-site hopping of excitons, with low exciton diffusivity associated with strong electron-nuclear coupling. Using Monte Carlo modeling calibrated by the experimental data, diffusivities are found to be orders of magnitudes lower than in 2D vdW semiconductors. Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) are below ~3 nm at all temperatures, and thus well below the optical diffraction limit. These results have basic implications for the use of excitons to probe and manipulate their surroundings in this and related magnetic CrX3 materials.</p>

            <p>This study presents SALMON VR, a visualization program designed to visualize the time evolution of electronic density changes and vector potentials in virtual reality (VR) space. The time-series electronic density data computed by SALMON are stored in CUBE format. SALMON VR processes these data to construct isosurfaces of electronic density variations and two-dimensional representations of vector potentials. Equipped with a user-friendly interface using VR technology, the program is available in two versions: one for the Meta Quest 3 head-mount display (Meta Platforms Inc., California) and one for PCs. Atoms are displayed as spheres of different sizes and colors according to their elemental properties. This visual representation facilitates a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between light and electrons. Users can easily manipulate the isosurface values, speed of animation, and color map of the vector potential. SALMON VR will enable researchers and educators to enhance their understanding of physical phenomena and improve engagement in learning environments.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate strong magnon-magnon coupling by thermal spin excitations in yttrium iron garnet/permalloy (YIG/Py) hybrid structures using microfocused Brillouin light scattering - an optical technique that enables the detection of zero-wavevector and higher-order wavevector spin waves in a broad frequency range. The thermally activated magnons in the bilayer lead to a hybrid excitation between magnon modes in the conductive Py layer with a wide wavevector range and the first perpendicular standing magnon modes in the insulating YIG layer, facilitated by strong interfacial exchange coupling. To further investigate this coupling, we compare the thermal magnon spectra with the results obtained from electrical excitation and detection methods, which primarily detect the uniform Py mode. The realization of coherent coupling between incoherent (thermal) magnons is important for advancing energy-efficient magnonic devices, particularly in classical as well as quantum spin-wave computing technologies.</p>

            <p>Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.</p>

            <p>Elucidating mechanical deformation in glassy materials at the atomic level is challenging due to their disordered atomic structure. Using our novel "frozen atom analysis," we reveal that anelastic deformation in CuZr metallic glasses is fundamentally driven by cooperative atomic motions of approximately 40 elastically linked atoms, forming trigger groups. They initiate localized rearrangements, which can cascade into plastic flow. Notably, these groups show no distinct structural or physical features, challenging the idea that deformation occurs in defective regions. Instead, deformation events are highly stochastic and transient, driven by collective atomic motion. This finding not only reshapes our understanding of glassy material deformation mechanisms but also highlights cooperative motion as a key factor in avalanche-like phenomena governing the behavior of disordered systems across multiple scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Reho, Arnold H. Kole, Nils Wittemeier, Andr√©s R. Botello-M√©ndez, Zeila Zanolli</p>
            <p>We investigate the superconducting properties of monolayer FeSe, both freestanding (ML FeSe) and on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), by simultaneously solving the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations. Our results demonstrate that the substrate profoundly alters both the normal-state and superconducting properties of FeSe. We identify proximity-induced superconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization between Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold increase in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states to the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where superconductivity emerges at both the $\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the substrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for superconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic superconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different k-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging states unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole hybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments. Our findings highlight the decisive impact of substrate (hybridization, strain, charge transfer, magnetic order) on the superconducting properties of FeSe. We suggest potential pathways for engineering novel high-temperature FeSe-based superconductors by leveraging interfacial interactions in substrates with high electron affinity.</p>

            <h2>Exact calculation of spectral properties of a particle interacting with a one-dimensional Fermi gas in optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia-Ji Liu, Hui Hu</p>
            <p>By using the exact Bethe wavefunctions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with $N$ spin-up fermions and one spin-down impurity, we derive an analytic expression of the impurity form factor, in the form of a determinant of a $(N+1)$ by $(N+1)$ matrix. This analytic expression enables us to exactly calculate spectral properties of one-dimensional Fermi polarons in lattices, when the masses of the impurity particle and the Fermi bath are equal. We present the impurity spectral function as functions of the on-site interaction strength and the filling factor of the Fermi bath, and discuss the origin of Fermi singularities in the spectral function at small momentum and the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at large momentum near the boundary of Brillouin zone. Our analytic expression of the impurity form factors pave the way to exploring the intriguing dynamics of a particle interacting with a Fermi bath. Our exact predictions on the impurity spectral function could be directly examined in cold-atom laboratories by using the radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting diode effect in Ising superconductors</h2>

            <p>We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I >> \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R << T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I >> \Delta_R \neq 0$.</p>

            <h2>Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier</p>
            <p>The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.</p>

The optimized lattice parameters are a=7.406 √Ö, b=21.425 √Ö, c=9.529 √Ö, and agree very well with the experimental data, thanks to the local Coulomb interactions and van der Waals forces included in the calculations. The investigation considers several magnetic orderings. The lowest total energy was found for the antiferromagnetic configuration with the magnetic moment of $\sim4.6~\mu_{\text{B}}$ per Fe atom. The electronic structure calculation shows the Mott insulating state with the energy gap $E_g=2.87$~eV. For the relaxed crystal structure, the elastic properties were obtained and analyzed.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longju Yu, Hong Jian Zhao, Laurent Bellaiche, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that LiMnPO$_4$ and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.</p>

            <h2>Controlled Diagonal Catalyst Improves the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Hattori, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.</p>

            <p>This work develops an analytical model to consistently interpret the steady-state and small-perturbation response (both in the time and frequency domain) of photoanodes for solar water-splitting. In addition to accounting for the fundamental mechanisms of charge-carrier generation, recombination and slow hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, the model overcomes the key shortcomings of existing models in the literature. These include consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit potential, that corresponds to an electron mobility of 0.022 cm2V-1s-1. The model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the literature in the case of hematite photoanodes. The generality of the model allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Magneto-Raman spectroscopy is applied to study spin-phonon coupling in the layered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We report on the effects of temperature and external magnetic field on Raman-active phonons of $A_g$ symmetry in bulk and one-to-six-layer forms of CrSBr that are reflected by the Raman spectral patterns measured at different configurations of circularly polarized laser beam. The results of experimental investigations reveal that spin-spin and spin-phonon interactions play a significant role below the N√©el temperature and are notably stronger in CrSBr monolayer than in bulk material. Spin-phonon coupling leads to the emergence of \textit{ new} phonon peaks at very low temperatures. Such effect is solely observed in one-to-six-layer CrSBr and is absent in its bulk form. Our experimental research is accompanied by \textit{ab initio} simulations of the Raman spectra of bulk and monolayer CrSBr that uncover correlations between intensities of Raman-active phonons and the arrangement of spin magnetic moments on Cr atoms. Comparative analysis of simulated and experimental Raman spectra suggests the most favored spin orientation in the CrSBr antiferromagnetic system.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, exhibiting high power conversion efficiency due to strong light absorption and long carrier diffusion lengths. While various aspects of their crystal and electronic structure have been studied, we identify a fundamental property previously overlooked that may significantly impact their efficiency. We demonstrate that halide perovskites realize a three-dimensional (3D) Lieb lattice, giving rise to a gapped 3D Dirac cone of spin-1 fermions. This leads to a fivefold reduction in effective mass compared to a conventional cubic structure and suppressed carrier backscattering due to Klein tunneling. Our conclusions are supported by band structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$. In particular, we reveal the transformation of the flat band of the Lieb lattice and the emergence of a dark corridor effect in photoemission from the Dirac cone, which increases as the band gap is decreased from CsPbBr$_3$ to CsSnBr$_3$.</p>

By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</p>

            <p>We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.</p>

            <p>Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in various biological and soft matter systems. This anomalous dynamics is typically attributed to heterogeneous environments inducing spatiotemporal variations in the diffusivity of tracer particles. While previous studies have predominantly focused on systems exhibiting either spatial or temporal heterogeneity, this work bridges the gap by introducing a model based on an annealed extreme landscape to simultaneously account for both types of heterogeneities. Through a combination of computational analyses and analytical derivations, we investigate how the interplay of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the energy landscape gives rise to Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of temporal environmental fluctuations, the heterogeneous diffusion inevitably converges to classical Brownian motion via a homogenization process. We derive an analytical expression for the homogenization time as a function of key parameters governing the system's spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Additionally, we quantify particle-to-particle diffusion heterogeneity and examine the ergodic properties of this model, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of complex, heterogeneous systems.</p>

            <p>The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</p>

            <p>The Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) is a recent concept proposed to maintain the thermal stability of standard MRAM at small diameters, considering thick vertical pillars as the free layer. In order to explore the specific physics of PSA-STT-MRAMs expected in relation with their three-dimensional nature, we have performed simulations combining a micromagnetic model coupled self-consistently with spin-dependent transport equations. The 3D shape induces flower states at the upper and lower surfaces. Besides, the field-like component of STT is found to be larger than in standard MRAMs, suggesting that it needs to be considered. The combination of both effects leads to the excitation of high-order 3D ferromagnetic resonance modes, playing a key role in magnetisation reversal. These results highlight features of 3D nanomagnetic systems, largely disregarded so far, which need to be considered to optimise PSA-STT-MRAM to be a competitive solution for technological implementation.</p>

            <h2>Revealing the proton slingshot mechanism in solid acid electrolytes through machine learning molecular dynamics</h2>

            <p>In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of fast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local proton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion rotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural network force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are initially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation, and the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the conventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent proton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural similarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms between CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations. CsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different activation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The higher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$ polyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$. Additionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in CsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to CsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could accelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified framework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid compounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and disordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.</p>

            <h2>Particle Pairing Caused Subdiffusion of Heavy Particles in the Imbalanced Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirko Daumann, Thomas Dahm</p>
            <p>The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.</p>

            <h2>Mechanism of Shape Symmetry Breaking in Surfactant Mediated Crystal Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Oaks-Leaf, David T. Limmer</p>
            <p>We present a dynamical model of crystal growth, in which it is possible to reliably achieve asymmetric products, beginning from symmetric initial conditions and growing within an isotropic environment. The asymmetric growth is the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of thermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline facets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the persistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general by studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of symmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses of single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting surfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental observables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of the surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of asymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.</p>

            <p>Twisted layered van-der-Waals materials often exhibit unique electronic and optical properties absent in their non-twisted counterparts. Unfortunately, predicting such properties is hindered by the difficulty in determining the atomic structure in materials displaying large moir√© domains. Here, we introduce a split machine-learned interatomic potential and dataset curation approach that separates intralayer and interlayer interactions and significantly improves model accuracy -- with a tenfold increase in energy and force prediction accuracy relative to conventional models. We further demonstrate that traditional MLIP validation metrics -- force and energy errors -- are inadequate for moir√© structures and develop a more holistic, physically-motivated metric based on the distribution of stacking configurations. This metric effectively compares the entirety of large-scale moir√© domains between two structures instead of relying on conventional measures evaluated on smaller commensurate cells. Finally, we establish that one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moir√© structures can serve as efficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical model validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our framework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions directly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer interaction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moir√© materials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated accuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Mathias S. Scheurer</p>
            <p>Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a "valley-independent Chern number", measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</p>

            <h2>Active wetting transitions induced by rotational noise at solid interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchismita Das, Raghunath Chelakkot</p>
            <p>We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</p>

            <p>In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</p>

            <p>Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Ming Koh, Wen-Tan Xue, Tommy Tai, Dax Enshan Koh, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>A lossy quantum system harboring the non-Hermitian skin effect can in certain conditions exhibit anomalously high loss at the boundaries of the system compared to the bulk, a phenomenon termed the non-Hermitian edge burst. We uncover interacting many-body extensions of the edge burst that are spatially extended and patterned, as well as cluster bursts that occur away from boundaries. Owing to the methodological difficulty and overhead of accurately realizing non-Hermitian dynamical evolution, much less tunable interactions, few experimental avenues in studying the single-particle edge burst have been reported to date and none for many-body variants. We overcome these roadblocks in this study, and present a realization of edge and cluster bursts in an interacting quantum ladder model on a superconducting quantum processor. We utilize a time-stepping algorithm, which implements time-evolution by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by composing a linear combination of unitaries scheme and product formulae, to assess long-time behavior of the system. We observe signatures of the non-Hermitian edge burst on up to 64 unit cells, and detect the closing of the dissipative gap, a necessary condition for the edge burst, by probing the imaginary spectrum of the system. In suitable interacting regimes, we identify the emergence of spatial patterning and cluster bursts. Beyond establishing these generalized forms of edge burst phenomena, our study paves the way for digital quantum processors to be harnessed as a versatile platform for non-Hermitian condensed-matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yahui Li, Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei Motrunich</p>
            <p>Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a systematic procedure based on optimal control theory to address the full counting statistics of particle transport in a stochastic system. Our approach enhances the performance of a Thouless pump in the non-adiabatic regime by simultaneously optimizing the average pumping rate while minimizing noise. We demonstrate our optimization procedure on a paradigmatic model for the electronic transport through a quantum dot, both in the limit of vanishing Coulomb interaction and in the interacting regime. Our method enables independent control of the moments associated with charge and spin transfer, allowing for the enhancement of spin current with minimal charge current or the independent tuning of spin and charge fluctuations. These results underscore the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to a broad class of stochastic systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>

            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10~mK and at 6~GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6~GHz niobium cavity at 10~mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100~mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$~10~mG limits $Q_0\sim$~10\textsuperscript{10}, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$~1~s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Scaling our findings to typical transmon qubit dimensions suggests that these 2-D structures could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds~mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch</p>
            <p>The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</p>

Additionally, we demonstrate that properly chosen noisy random PS circuits suppress error proliferation and, when employed as a variational ansatz, exhibit superior trainability.</p>

This study investigates the potential of repurposing these ATCs in advanced reactor designs, aiming to expedite material development and reduce costs. The research employs a multi-physics approach, encompassing neutronics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, and structural mechanics, to evaluate four candidate materials (Haynes 230, Zircaloy-4, FeCrAl, and SiC-SiC) within the context of a high-temperature, sodium-cooled microreactor, exemplified by the Kilopower design. While neutronic simulations revealed negligible power profile variations among the materials, finite element analyses highlighted the superior thermal stability of SiC-SiC and the favorable stress resistance of Haynes 230. The high-temperature environment significantly impacted material performance, particularly for Zircaloy-4 and FeCrAl, while SiC-SiC's inherent properties limited its ability to withstand stress loads. Additionally, AI-driven uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the influence of material property variations on maximum hoop stress. The findings underscore the need for further research into high-temperature material properties to facilitate broader applicability of existing materials to advanced reactors. Haynes 230 is identified as the most promising candidate based on the evaluated criteria.</p>

            <p>The methods of Nicholson and Shain and Randles-Sevcik are the paradigms of voltammetry of redox species. However, as they were originally developed for aqueous redox couples, they cannot be directly applied to solid redox films such as those of battery materials. Herein, for the first time, we present a cyclic voltammetry model based on semi-infinite linear diffusion for ion-coupled electron transfer reactions. The simulated CVs contain parameters such as capacity, ion activity, formal potential of proton-coupled electron transfer, and scan rate that are physically more meaningful than those of the current models in characterizing energy storage materials. We apply this model to the MnO2 cathode material as a proof of concept and discuss the significance of the simulation parameters for determining the energetics of the underlying phase transitions and the charge storage mechanisms. According to the present model, two linear regression lines can be established from relatively simple voltammetry experiments for characterizing energy storage materials: 1) The regression line of the CV mid-peak potential vs. Log of ion activity (or pH), in which the slope and the intercept provide information on the type of charge-carrier ions and their solvation state, respectively. 2) The regression line of the capacity vs. the inverse of the square root of scan rate, where the slope and intercept indicate the contributions of bulk and surface charges in thin redox films, respectively.</p>

            <p>Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</p>

Houck</p>
            <p>Materials improvements are a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits because such improvements can be readily translated to large scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by utilizing tantalum (Ta) as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve major improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon (Si) dramatically decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Q) exceeding 1.5 x 10^7, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 x 10^7, corresponding to a lifetime (T_1) of up to 1.68 ms. This low loss allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T_2E) exceeding T_1. We achieve these material improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F√∂rster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</p>

            <h2>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho</p>
            <p>We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</p>

            <h2>Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Fertig, Mathijs Janssen</p>
            <p>Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of polarizable particles coupled to a lossy cavity mode that are transversally driven by a laser. Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk</p>
            <p>Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</p>

            <p>The scalability and power of quantum computing architectures depend critically on high-fidelity operations and robust and flexible qubit connectivity. In this respect, mobile qubits are particularly attractive as they enable dynamic and reconfigurable qubit arrays. This approach allows quantum processors to adapt their connectivity patterns during operation, implement different quantum error correction codes on the same hardware, and optimize resource utilization through dedicated functional zones for specific operations like measurement or entanglement generation. Such flexibility also relieves architectural constraints, as recently demonstrated in atomic systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms manipulated with optical tweezers. In solid-state platforms, highly coherent shuttling of electron spins was recently reported. A key outstanding question is whether it may be possible to perform quantum gates directly on the mobile spins. In this work, we demonstrate two-qubit operations between two electron spins carried towards each other in separate traveling potential minima in a semiconductor device. We find that the interaction strength is highly tunable by their spatial separation, achieving an average two-qubit gate fidelity of about 99\%. Additionally, we implement conditional post-selected quantum state teleportation between spatially separated qubits with an average gate fidelity of 87\%, showcasing the potential of mobile spin qubits for non-local quantum information processing. We expect that operations on mobile qubits will become a universal feature of future large-scale semiconductor quantum processors.</p>

            <p>This work presents a foundational approach for fabricating arrays of self-aligned micro- and nanopillar structures incorporating individual site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) for enhanced light extraction. This method leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.</p>

            <p>We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans√§tze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</p>

            <h2>Natural Quantization of Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Barney, Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Gyawali, Henry Shackleton, Zhu-Xi Luo, Michael Lawler</p>
            <p>Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and determining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The threshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a coding and a no-coding \emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error correction, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal code that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system experiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal code, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical mechanics, \emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this perspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum circuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization, we find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$ code'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase with first-order transitions between them and a novel \emph{zero capacity multi-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we provide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the optimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the multi-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions. Carrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic way to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</p>

            <p>Quantum groups and quantum algebras have received considerable attention in the last decades because they are very useful as mathematical tools of research. Existing proposals for quantum groups have always suggested the idea of deforming a classical object. Motivated by the possibility of anyons in three dimensions ($d=3$), with important consequences to a wide range of fields of physics, in the present work we investigate how the magnetization and other thermodynamic quantities, associated to the Landau diamagnetism problem, depend on the deforming parameter of two models with intermediate statistics: (i) $q$-fermions and (ii) $F$-anyons, and make {\it comparisons between both cases}. In particular, we extend the results from the literature for $q$-fermions by considering {\it second order terms} in the expansion of the grand partition function. Also, we find that for $F$-anyons statistics the magnetization shows a stronger response with respect to magnetic fields compared to magnetization for $q$-fermions statistics. This theoretical outcome may be experimentally verified for instance in superconductors, that are perfect diamagnetic materials with strong magnetic susceptibility, by adjusting impurities or pressure. The latter can be associated to the deforming parameter $q$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</p>
            <p>Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.L. Bobrov</p>
            <p>Ta-Cu and NbSe2-Cu heterocontacts have been studied. For Ta-Cu contacts, a theoretical estimation of the delta-functional barrier at the boundary, arising due to the mismatch of the Fermi parameters of the contacting metals, has been carried out, and good agreement between the calculation and experiment has been obtained. An expression for estimating the diameter of the heterocontact on both sides of the boundary is obtained. The value of the jump-like reduction of the excess current (and superconducting gap) associated with the phase transition of the superconducting region near the point contact to a spatially inhomogeneous state when the critical concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles is reached is determined. The dependence of the additive differential resistance on the displacement at the contact arising after the phase transition due to the excess charge of quasiparticles and the associated reverse current (or additive voltage) is obtained. In 2H-NbSe2, a two-zone superconductivity character with an 8-fold difference in the energy gap values takes place. Under the action of current injection of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, there is a sequential phase transition of layers adjacent to the point contact into a spatially inhomogeneous state with a suppressed gap, which is accompanied by a stepwise change in the slope of the I-V curve with a discrete increase in the differential resistance.</p>

            <p>Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics in a variety of disciplines. The generic LMG model usually incorporates two nonlinear interactions. While the classical dynamics of the single-nonlinear-inteaction LMG model is well understood through Jacobi elliptic functions, the dualinteraction case remains unexplored due to analytical challenges. Here, by constructing an auxiliary function that maps the dynamics to the complex plane of Jacobi elliptic functions, we derive exact solutions of classical dynamics for the dual-interaction LMG model. Based on the exact solutions, we give the classical dynamical phase diagram of the LMG model with dual nonlinear interactions, and find out a non-logarithmic behavior of dynamical criticality which is absent in case of single nonlinear interaction. Our results establish a benchmark to analyze the quantum dynamical phase transitions and many-body entanglement dynamics of finite-size LMG model.</p>

The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccessible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Uhlmann phase, a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite temperature. The Uhlmann phase characterizes topological properties of mixed states, in contrast to the Berry phase which is defined for pure states at zero temperature. Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general formula for the Uhlmann phase of BECs. Numerical calculations reveal that the Uhlmann phase can differ from the Berry phase in the zero-temperature limit, contrary to previous studies. As the temperature increases, the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior, and we relate the total winding degree to the Berry phase. This winding indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values on a Riemann surface. Furthermore, we propose an experimental scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of BECs by purifying the density matrix using an atomic interferometer.</p>

            <p>Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS), involving a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical data as well as experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], and show that the information from a second measurement basis highly improves the performance.

We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.</p>

            <p>Leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing promises potential for scaling up silicon-based quantum processors. In this context, control and readout of individual spin qubits have been shown on devices manufactured on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, which forms the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of $10$. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubits unit cell while providing high gain. We achieve a $74\%$ singlet-triplet readout fidelity in $8~\mu$s integration time, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration on a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards the large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Experimental realization of entanglement between two Brownian particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshmanan Theerthagiri, Sergio Ciliberto</p>
            <p>We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kruti, Roman-Pascal Riwar</p>
            <p>Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</p>

            <p>Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.</p>

Specifically, we explore how this phenomenon emerges in $4d^2/5d^2$ Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit and Hund's couplings. Our study uncovers the origin of magnetic multipolar interactions in these systems and demonstrates that a combination of quadrupolar and octupolar magnetic order can simultaneously induce both electrical quadrupolar moments and ferroelectric polarization. By expanding the multiferroic framework to higher-order multipoles, we reveal the possibility of coexisting multipolar orders of different or same ranks, paving the way for new functional properties in a large class of strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>We explore the ground states and quench dynamics of one-dimensional quantum droplets with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an imbalance in intracomponent interactions. A plethora of miscible ground state stripe and standard (i.e., non-modulated) droplets is found depending on the SOC wavenumber and building upon Gaussian to flat-top background for increasing (decreasing) atom number (interactions). Deformations among the states were accompanied by spin population transfer caused by the Rabi coupling and could be controlled by adjusting the interactions or the SOC parameters. When considering a trap, we identified a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state, characterized by a sign change of the chemical potential, which occurred at lower (larger) atom numbers for tighter traps (stronger interactions). The droplet's breathing motion was accompanied by minor population transfer, and its frequency increases for a larger intracomponent interaction ratio or reaching a maximum at SOC wavenumbers, where the transition from non-modulated flat-top to stripe droplets occurred. We witness droplet fragmentation for abrupt changes in the Rabi coupling while large amplitude quenches of the SOC wavenumber trigger spin-demixing, resulting in constant amplitude but opposite direction motion of untrapped droplets or in-trap out-of-phase oscillating droplets. Our findings have implications for controlled spin-demixing processes of droplets and the excitation of relevant magnetic bound states.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties, CDW states, and their response to strain in monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can increase the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results, validating our computational approach. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Nonperturbative calculation of exchange coupling parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda</p>
            <p>Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. To calculate $J_{ij}$ from first principles, perturbative methods based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT), commonly referred to as Liechtenstein's method, have been widely employed. However, the quantitative accuracy of $J_{ij}$ obtained through this perturbative technique remains uncertain. In this paper, we nonperturbatively calculate $J_{ij}$ for several systems of both fundamental and applied significance, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare these results with those obtained using the conventional MFT-based method. The nonperturbative approach provides consistent results for magnetic configurations exhibiting a certain degree of magnetic disorder. In contrast, due to its inherent theoretical limitations, the MFT-based method struggles to accurately evaluate the magnetic energy in such configurations. As discussed later in this paper, these discrepancies arise from neglected contributions within MFT-based methods. Our nonperturbative scheme is highly versatile and holds strong prospects as a new platform for analyzing and designing spintronic materials, where developing accurate spin models is essential.</p>

            <h2>Lattice thermal conductivity in the anharmonic overdamped regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ƒêorƒëe Dangiƒá, Giovanni Caldarelli, Raffaello Bianco, Ivana Saviƒá, Ion Errea</p>
            <p>In crystalline materials, low lattice thermal conductivity is often associated with strong anharmonicity, which can cause significant deviations from the expected Lorentzian lineshape of phonon spectral functions. These deviations, occurring in an overdamped regime, raise questions about the applicability of the Boltzmann transport equation. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can trigger structural phase transitions with temperature, which cannot be adequately described by the standard harmonic approximation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for computing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our method combines the Green-Kubo linear response theory with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The latter allows us to describe the temperature-dependent evolution of the crystal structure, including first- and second-order phase transitions, as well as the vibrational properties in highly anharmonic materials. The Green-Kubo method considers the entire lineshapes of phonon spectral functions in the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity, thus eliminating the questionable use of phonon lifetimes in the overdamped regime, as well as naturally including coherent transport effects. Additionally, we extend our theory to model complex dynamical lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing our understanding of time-dependent thermoreflectance experiments. As a practical application, we employ this approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$, a complex crystal known for its anomalous thermal transport behavior with a complex phase diagram. Our method is able to determine the thermal conductivity across different phases in good agreement with experiments.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are magnetic materials with antiferromagnetic spin ordering but exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Understanding the microscopic origin of the latter is a central problem. Ferromagnet-like properties such as the anomalous Hall effect are linked with weak ferromagnetism, whose microscopic origin in altermagnets remains unclear however. We show theoretically that the alternating $g$-tensor anisotropy in altermagnets can induce weak ferromagnetism even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is forbidden. We demonstrate this mechanism to explain weak ferromagnetism for both collinear and noncollinear spin altermagnets. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of weak ferromagnetism and suggest orbital-based ways for manipulating magnetic configurations in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Fisher Information (FI) is a quantity ubiquitously measured in such varied areas like metrology, machine learning, and biological complexity. Mathematically, it represents a lower bound in the variance of unknown parameters that are related to the distributions one has access, and a metric for probability manifolds. A stochastic analogous of the Fisher Information, dubbed stochastic Fisher Information was recently introduced in the literature by some of us. By exploring the probability distributions of the Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length in entropy space derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the SFI with time as a parameter. Finally, we test our geometric fluctuation relations using two nonequilibrium models.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor capacitors for high-temperature non-volatile memory applications. Our 30-nm thick ferroelectric Al0.68Sc0.32N film grown on SiC exhibits stable and robust ferroelectric switching up to 1000¬∞C. The coercive field decreases linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800¬∞C, further reducing to -2.5 MV cm-1 at 1000¬∞C. At 600¬∞C, the devices achieve remarkable reliability with ~2000 endurance cycles and over at least 100 hours of retention with negligible polarization loss. At 800¬∞C, the devices retain data for at least 10,000 seconds and exceed 400 write cycles. Our results further highlight the potential for ferroelectric AlScN thin-films particularly when paired with SiC semiconductor substrates for high-temperature non-volatile memory.</p>

            <p>Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</p>

This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</p>

            <p>Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hu Xu, Frederic Marazzato, Paul Plucinsky</p>
            <p>Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.</p>

            <p>The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</p>

DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale. Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches.

            <p>MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</p>

We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</p>

            <p>Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos√©-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</p>

            <h2>Foundation of classical dynamical density functional theory: uniqueness of time-dependent density-potential mappings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Andreas Klatt, Christian Bair, Hartmut L√∂wen, Ren√© Wittmann</p>
            <p>When can we map a classical density profile to an external potential? In equilibrium, without time dependence, the one-body density is known to specify the external potential that is applied to the many-body system. This mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we consider non-equilibrium, time-dependent many-body systems that evolve from a given initial condition. We derive explicit conditions, for example, no flux at the boundary, that ensure that the mapping from the density to a time-dependent external potential is unique. We thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), without resorting to the so-called adiabatic approximation often used in applications. By ascertaining uniqueness for all $n$-body densities, we ensure that the proof and the physical conclusions drawn from it hold for general superadiabatic dynamics of interacting systems even in the presence of (known) non-conservative forces.</p>

            <p>Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22~mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.</p>

            <p>Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</p>

            <p>The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p>The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Chuan Lu, Zhengdi Sun, Zipei Zhang</p>
            <p>The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N < 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</p>

            <p>Stars orbiting a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies undergo very efficient diffusion in their orbital orientations: this is "Vector Resonant Relaxation". Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics. In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated "Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.</p>

            <h2>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Giral Mart√≠nez</p>
            <p>Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</p>

We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Ozawa, Henning Schomerus</p>
            <p>Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</p>

            <h2>Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy: multi-reference random phase approximation via diagrammatic resummation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li</p>
            <p>Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based on Green's functions and Feynman diagrams provides a fundamental theoretical framework for various \emph{ab initio} computational approaches in molecular and materials science, including the random phase approximation (RPA) and $GW$ approximation. Unfortunately, this perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference characters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly nontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of Wick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly correlated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's function in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively formulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work. Our formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation effects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions through a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a concrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the standard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring diagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to both SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems reveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in strongly correlated systems. This theoretical advancement paves the way for advancing \emph{ab initio} computational methods through diagrammatic resummation techniques in future.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p>

            <p>When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</p>

We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian.

            <p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</p>

Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions.

            <p>Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes. In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.</p>

            <p>The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC has attracted significant research attention owing to its remarkable spin and optical properties at ambient temperatures. Unlike many color centers that require cryogenic conditions to function, the PL6 center maintains optical activity even at room temperature or higher, benefiting from the material's high thermal conductivity and chemical stability. To elucidate the origin of PL6's distinctive characteristics and clarify its microscopic structure in the crystal, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of potential defect complexes through systematic first-principles calculations. Our computational approach rigorously evaluates the electronic structures and spin-related properties of various defect configurations, enabling reasonable identification of the most probable atomic arrangement responsible for the observed characteristics of PL6. Our analysis identifies a limited set of candidate structures with ${\rm C_{3v}}$-like symmetry consistent with known experimental signatures. Among these, two defect complexes emerge as the most likely PL6 candidates. The findings suggest that targeted experimental studies, such as electron spin resonance and optically detected magnetic resonance, could further clarify the nature of the PL6 center, while additional theoretical investigations on transition matrix elements and defect formation dynamics are warranted.</p>

            <h2>Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn</p>
            <p>Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Reicht, Lukas Legenstein, Sandro Wieser, Egbert Zojer</p>
            <p>Heat transport can be modelled with a variety of approaches in real space (using molecular dynamics) or in reciprocal space (using the Boltzmann transport equation). Employing two conceptually different approaches of each type, we study heat transport in crystalline polyethylene and polythiophene. We find that consistent results can be obtained when using highly efficient and accurate machine-learned potentials, provided that the physical intricacies of the considered materials and methods are correctly accounted for. For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.</p>

            <p>We systematically explore a pathway for generating nonlinear charge and spin photocurrents using spin-orbit-split surface states. This mechanism enables net charge and spin flow along the surface plane even in centrosymmetric bulk environments like the Rashba prototype Au(111), where we establish the key principles by combining model predictions with density functional calculations. We further identify the Tl/Si(111) surface, characterized by strong non-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, as a prime candidate for experimental validation; with slight doping, it develops metallic spin-orbit-split states featuring remarkable relativistic properties while the bulk remains semiconducting. Our non-linear simulations reveal distinct angular signatures and magnitudes comparable to bulk ferroelectrics, highlighting the potential of surface-state photocurrents for low-bias optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the intricate spin polarization of surface states opens new possibilities as a nonlinear spin filter, providing a far more versatile platform than the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions in elastic media give rise to rich non-equilibrium behaviors, but controllable experimental realizations of such odd elastic phenomena remain scarce. Building on recent breakthroughs in electrical analogs of non-Hermitian solid-state systems, we design and analyze scalable odd electrical circuits (OECs) as exact analogs of an odd solid. We show that electrical work can be extracted from OECs via cyclic excitations and trace the apparent energy gain back to active circuit elements. We show that OECs host oscillatory modes that resemble recent experimental observations in living chiral crystals and identify active resonances that reveal a perspective on odd elasticity as a mechanism for mechanical amplification.</p>

            <p>We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per unit cell, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junctions array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junctions central weak link area.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer R√©nyi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R√©nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R√©nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Pedro Garc√≠a-Pintos, Yi-Kai Liu, Alexey Gorshkov</p>
            <p>The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Bothe, Eloise Lardet, Alexei Poliakov, Gunnar Pruessner, Thibault Bertrand, Ignacio Bordeu</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhou Xu, Antoine Maillard, Lenka Zdeborov√°, Florent Krzakala</p>
            <p>In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</p>

            <p>The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</p>

            <p>Chiral superconductivity exhibits the formation of novel electron pairs that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and has been actively studied in various quantum materials in recent years. However, despite its potential to provide definitive information, effects of disorder in the crystal structure on the chiral superconductivity has not yet been clarified, and therefore the investigation using a solid-solution system is desirable. We report muon-spin-relaxation (muSR) results of layered pnictide BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with a honeycomb network composed of Pt and (As, Sb). We observed an increase of the zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate in the superconducting (SC) state at the Sb end of x=1.0, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic field due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the SC state. On the other hand, spontaneous magnetic field was almost and completely suppressed for the As-Sb mixed samples of x=0.9 and 0.2, respectively, suggesting that the time-reversal symmetry breaking SC state in x=1.0 is sensitive to disorder. The magnetic penetration depth estimated from transverse-field muSR measurements at x=1.0 and 0.2 behaved like weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. These seemingly incompatible zero-field and transverse-field muSR results of BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with x=1.0 could be understood in terms of chiral d-wave superconductivity with point nodes on the three-dimensional Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</p>

            <p>A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial band topology. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial band topology and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</p>

            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. We theoretically prove the topological behavior and phase transition of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Also, Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term $(C_s=1$ and $C_v=0)$, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of non-trivial and trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Laura Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Munch, Barbara Wagner</p>
            <p>We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</p>

            <p>Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.</p>

            <h2>A high-throughput ab initio study of elemental segregation and cohesion at ferritic-iron grain boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Lin Mai, Xiang-Yuan Cui, Tilmann Hickel, J√∂rg Neugebauer, Simon Ringer</p>
            <p>Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.</p>

            <h2>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics and viscous thermoelectric equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jennifer Coulter, Bogdan Rajkov, Michele Simoncelli</p>
            <p>Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</p>

            <p>We propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for a digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filling two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In such example we obtain fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable to study the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devvrat Tiwari, Baibhab Bose, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei I. Pavlov, Yuval Gefen, Alexander Shnirman</p>
            <p>Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo M. Piaggi, Julian D. Gale, Paolo Raiteri</p>
            <p>A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wai-Keong Mok, Tobias Haug, Adam L. Shaw, Manuel Endres, John Preskill</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for constructing solvable lattice models of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics with multiple unitary directions using biunitary connections. We show that a network of biunitary connections on the Kagome lattice naturally defines a multi-unitary circuit, where three `arrows of time' directly reflect the lattice symmetry. These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.</p>

            <p>Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahnaz Farhat, Denis P√©rice, S√∂ren Petrat</p>
            <p>The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schr√∂dinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragan Markoviƒá, Mihailo ƒåubroviƒá</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruna G. M. Ara√∫jo, Antonio M S Macedo</p>
            <p>Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Yang, Gabriel Cardoso, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijat Sarma, Yimu Bao, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Thomas Kiely, Cenke Xu</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moir√© bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.</p>

            <p>Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications.

Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ajesh Kumar, Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on the Kagome spin liquid candidate YCOB suggest the presence of Dirac fermionic spinons near the magnetization plateau at 1/9. Theories suggest that the spinons are charge neutral spin-$1/2$ excitations, in a $2\pi/3$ flux which triples the unit cell. Generally a gap is expected, and there is no symmetry protection for the Dirac nodes in this system. The question arises as to what causes the nodes and stabilizes them. In this work, we propose a node-creation and node-pinning mechanism driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Employing Gutzwiller-projected variational Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that DM interactions induce a band closing phase transition in the spinon spectrum. There is a change in the Chern number when the bands are inverted. Together with the DM-generated internal gauge flux, the coupling to the spinon orbital magnetization counteracts the band reopening. This interplay energetically pins the Dirac nodes over a range of parameters.</p>

            <p>$\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ is an itinerant magnet with a small saturated moment of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu_{B}/\text{Ni}$ and a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_1$ = 61.0 K, $T_2$ = 56.5 K and $T_3$ = 42.2 K. Temperature and field dependent measurements suggest a complex, anisotropic $H-T$ phase diagram with multiple phase lines. Here we present the growth and characterization of single crystals of the ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ series for 0 $\leq x \leq$ 0.181. Using a suite of anisotropic magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements we study the evolution of the three AFM transitions upon Cu substitution. For ${0 \leq x \leq 0.097}$, the system remains magnetically ordered at base temperature with $x \leq$ 0.012, showing signs of three primarily AFM phases. For the higher substitution levels, ${0.125 \leq x \leq 0.181}$, there are no signatures of magnetic ordering, but an anomalous feature in resistance and heat capacity data are observed which are consistent with the Kondo effect in this system. The intermediate $x$ = 0.105 sample lies in between the magnetic ordered and the Kondo regime and is in the vicinity of the AFM-quantum critical point (QCP). Thus, ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ is an example of a small moment system that can be tuned through a QCP. Given these data combined with the fact that the $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ structure has kagome-like, Ni-sublattice running perpendicular to the crystallographic $c-$ axis, and a $3d$-electron flat band that contributes to the density of states near the Fermi energy, it becomes a promising candidate to host and study exotic physics.</p>

            <h2>Revealing electronic correlations in YNi$_2$B$_2$C using photoemission spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aki Pulkkinen, Geoffroy Kremer, Vladimir N. Strocov, Frank Weber, J√°n Min√°r, Claude Monney</p>
            <p>We present a combined density functional theory (DFT), one-step model of photoemission, and soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the quaternary borocarbide superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C. Our analysis reveals the presence of moderate electronic correlations beyond the semilocal DFT within the generalized gradient approximation. We show that DFT and the full potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) with average Coulomb interaction U = 3.0 eV and the exchange energy J = 0.9 eV applied to the Ni d-states are necessary for reproducing the experimentally observed SX-ARPES spectra.</p>

            <h2>Spectroscopic signatures of biexcitons: A case study in Ruddlesden-Popper lead-halides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine A. Koch, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Martin Gomez-Dominguez, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Carlos Silva-Acuna, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada</p>
            <p>Exciton-exciton interactions are fundamental to the light-emitting properties of semiconductors, influencing applications from lasers to quantum light sources. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances with unique lattice coupling. Using three spectroscopic techniques - photoluminescence (PL) and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) - we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering a mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross-coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton-polarons within layered perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Igor Zutic</p>
            <p>Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Exchange-Coupled Spins for Robust High-Temperature Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Chakraborty, Md. Fahim F. Chowdhury, Mohamad Niknam, Louis S. Bouchard, Jayasimha Atulasimha</p>
            <p>We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (>1 K).</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive landscape and simple rules for transition-metal Heusler semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Zhang, Zirui Dong, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. To broaden the scope of Heusler semiconductors, advancements have been made in developing variants such as double-half Heuslers XX'Y2Z2 and quaternary full Heuslers XX'YZ, which incorporate four constituent elements. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 <= b <= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 <= a + b <= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Stefano Bosco</p>
            <p>Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth containing wide band gap oxides, which provide spin-photon interface and narrow linewidth optical emission, are getting significant attention as the most promising candidate materials in advancing quantum transduction and memories. Here, from $ab~initio$ calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic ground states in structurally preferred monoclinic CePO$_4$ and tetragonal CeVO$_4$ exhibiting localized occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states with $4f-4f$ transition characteristics. Interestingly, in CePO$_4$, O $2p$ and P $3p$ states hybridize negligibly with Ce $4f$ states, while in CeVO$_4$, V $3d$ and O $2p$ states hybridize and appear as extended states in between the occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states. Here, phonon calculations and analysis identify and differentiate Raman active phonon modes along with the spin phonon coupling of Ce in both CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$ that ultimately lead to different $4f$ ground state crystal field multiplets, which are critical to accurately describe electronic transitions for foundational quantum transduction and memories. Further, the identified $C_1$ site symmetry of Ce, lacking inversion symmetry in CePO$_4$, is relevant for quantum memories and $D_{2d}$ site symmetry of Ce exhibiting inversion symmetry in CeVO$_4$ is relevant for quantum transduction.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic higher-order topological states in 2D honeycomb Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sibin L√º, Jun Hu</p>
            <p>The exploration of topological phases remains a cutting-edge research frontier, driven by their promising potential for next-generation electronic and quantum technologies. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling to systematically investigate the topological properties of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb Bi, HgTe, and Al2O3(0001)-supported HgTe. Remarkably, all three systems exhibit coexistence of first-order and higher-order topological insulator states, manifested by gapless edge states in one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons and symmetry-related corner states in zero-dimensional (0D) nanoflakes. Furthermore, fractional electron charges may accumulate at the corners of armchair-edged nanoflakes. Among these materials, HgTe/Al2O3(0001) is particularly promising due to its experimentally feasible atomic configuration and low-energy corner states. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring higher-order topological phases in Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators and pave the way for new possibilities in device applications.</p>

            <h2>Spin orientation by electric current in altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. E. Golub, L. ≈†mejkal</p>
            <p>It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</p>

            <p>Beyond the study of individual materials, their interfaces and arising functionality are crucial enablers of fundamental science and technological applications. Recently, the arena of two-dimensional (2D) materials was extended to so-called non-van der Waals (non-vdW) compounds derived from strongly bonded non-layered bulk crystals. These nanosystems with their active surfaces complement now - through their chemically bonded heterostructure (HS) interfaces - the established space of weakly interacting vdW HSs. Here, we study a wide range of 55 candidate non-vdW HSs with autonomous density functional calculations and find that the resulting interfacial chemical hybridization and bonding is the key factor determining their electronic and magnetic properties. It gives rise to the formation of hybrid interface bands, strong magnetic coupling, and substantial electronic as well as magnetic moire surface property modulations upon twisting. Our work thus provides a significant step towards charting the new interface class of non-vdW HSs.</p>

            <h2>Negative temperature coefficient of resistivity due to the itinerant spin fluctuations in metallic V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SK Ramjan, Asi Khandelwal, L. S. Sharath Chandra, M. K. Chattopadhyay</p>
            <p>Few concentrated disordered binary metallic alloys show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), which is quite unusual. V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ is one such alloy that shows resistivity exceeding 100 $\mu\Omega$ cm and exhibits negative TCR. The addition of ferromagnetic rare-earth Gd, which is insoluble in the body-centered cubic V-Ti matrix, changes the negative TCR to positive (when Gd conc. $\geq$ 2 at.$\%$). Evidence of spin polarization of conduction electrons of the V-Ti matrix by Gd clusters is obtained from the magnetization experiments as well as from the anomalous component of the Hall effect. Our analysis suggests that the additional scattering due to the distribution in the electron-spin fluctuation interaction arising from the substitution of titanium in vanadium is the origin of the negative TCR. The Gd clusters polarize the conduction electrons, leading to the suppression of spin fluctuations, resulting in the positive TCR.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we use a nonperturbative renormalization group approach to construct the dynamical phase space of a quantum spin glass in the large $N$ limit. The disordered Hamiltonian is of ``$2 + p$" type, and we perform a coarse-graining procedure over the Wigner spectrum for the matrix-like disorder. The phase space reconstruction relies on phase transitions derived from the Luttinger-Ward functional, which accounts for interactions that are forbidden by perturbation theory. Various phases are identified, characterized by large correlations between replicas and/or the breaking of time translation symmetry.</p>

            <p>Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</p>

            <p>The structural and physical properties of two single-grain Au-Al-Gd 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with analyzed compositions Au73.67Al12.24Gd14.09 and Au74.67Al11.35Gd13.98 were thoroughly investigated. The two variants are iso-structural (cubic, space group: Im-3 undergoing sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 9.6 K and TN = 8.3 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements in both samples evidenced sharp jump at TN, associated with the AFM transition, accompanied by broad Schottky-type anomalies at lower temperatures. Strikingly, the two 1/1 ACs exhibited markedly different responses to applied magnetic fields: one displayed a pronounced metamagnetic anomaly while the other did not. In this regard, variational calculations with adiabatic transformation of the magnetic field in realistic structural models identified the existence of two possible AFM phases: the cuboc phase with a metamagnetic anomaly and the cluster N√©el phase without it, thereby clearly revealing the possible magnetic structures of the present AFM variants. These findings have led to the establishment of a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram for Heisenberg-type 1/1 ACs. This work not only advances our understanding of magnetic phase transitions in these complex systems but also suggests the existence of a broader spectrum of unexplored magnetic states in Tsai-type materials.</p>

            <p>The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</p>

            <p>We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks--Chandler--Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation. Our results may serve as a guide when a numerical method is needed for application to experimental data, and as a reference for further development of the methodology itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Watanabe, Keisuke Yamada, Yoshinobu Nakatani</p>
            <p>Recently, spin-transfer torque (STT) based magnetization switching has been widely utilized in magnetic resistance-based memories, which have broad applications in microcontroller units and other devices. This study utilizes a macrospin model to simulate magnetization switching in nanoscale magnets with perpendicular anisotropy through spin-splitter torque (SST). The study primarily addresses minimizing the current for magnetization switching and identifying the conditions necessary for achieving high switching probabilities. Notably, the threshold current density for SST-induced magnetization switching is reduced by approximately 75-80% compared to conventional STT and spin-orbit torque mechanisms, provided the spin torque polar angle is optimized. For practical implementation in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), a polar angle exceeding roughly 128 degrees must be maintained to ensure sufficient switching probability. Additionally, optimizing the shape of the applied current pulse significantly lowers the switching per rate by approximately 18 times. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SST in reducing magnetization switching currents and offer valuable insights into its potential application in SST-MRAM technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brady Wu, Qinghao Mao, Bryan VanSaders, Heinrich M. Jaeger</p>
            <p>In active fluids and active solids the constituents individually generate movement by each extracting energy from their environment or from their own source. Non-reciprocal interactions among these active constituents then enable novel collective behavior that often can be strikingly counterintuitive. However, non-reciprocity in these cases typically requires that the interacting bodies have different physical properties or it needs to be programmed explicitly into all pairwise interactions. Here we show that collective activity in a driven system can emerge spontaneously through multibody nonreciprocal forces, even if all bodies are individually non-active and have identical properties. We demonstrate this with as few as three identical spheres, acoustically levitated in air, which exhibit collective activity as they interact through non-pairwise forces: similar to the classic gravitational three-body problem, the interaction between two spheres depends sensitively on the relative position of the third sphere. Non-reciprocity arises naturally from both near-field sound scattering and microstreaming forces among the spheres. The underdamped dynamics in air furthermore make it possible to go beyond collective center-of-mass propulsion or rotation and observe internal, engine-like reconfigurations that follow limit cycles. These findings open up new possibilities for self-assembly, where now multibody interactions not only determine the resulting structure but also drive the spontaneously emerging dynamics.</p>

            <p>Owing to the intrinsically high crystallization temperatures, layered phase-change materials, such as CrGeTe3 and InGeTe3, are attracting attention for embedded memory applications, In addition to the electrical contrast, a major change in magnetic properties is observed in CrGeTe3 upon switching from the crystalline to the amorphous state. In this work, we report a combined ab initio modeling and magnetic characterization study on the isostructural silicon parent compound of CrGeTe3, namely, CrSiTe3. Amorphous CrSiTe3 has similar structural properties to amorphous CrGeTe3; however, it shows a smaller energy difference between the ferromagnetic configuration and the random magnetic configuration, indicating a high probability of spin glass formation. Indeed, direct-current and alternating-current magnetic measurements show that the coercive force of amorphous CrSiTe3 is higher than that of amorphous CrGeTe3. Therefore, the pinning effect of spins is enhanced in amorphous CrSiTe3, leading to a more robust spin glass state with a higher freezing temperature. The large magnetic contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phase could make CrSiTe3 a potential candidate for phase-change magnetic switching applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nozomi Higashino, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing magnetization, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. Upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE significantly increases and exceeds the conventional limits of AHE of intrinsic origin. Additionally, we observe a topological Hall effect (THE) that emerges in the conical magnetic phase. Notably, the THE in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ persists over an extended magnetic field range of up to 25~T. Our detailed transport measurements highlight the need for theoretical modeling to explain the observations of AHE and THE in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$= Rare earth) family of compounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Heng Tseng, Shang-Wei Li, Fu-Jiun Jiang</p>
            <p>It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.</p>

            <h2>Spiral spin liquid in a frustrated honeycomb antiferromagnet: A single-crystal study of GdZnPO</h2>

            <p>The frustrated honeycomb spin model can stabilize a subextensively degenerate spiral spin liquid with nontrivial topological excitations and defects, but its material realization remains rare. Here, we report the experimental realization of this model in the structurally disorder-free compound GdZnPO. Using a single-crystal sample, we find that spin-7/2 rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ ions form a honeycomb lattice with dominant second-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic and first-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, along with easy-plane single-site anisotropy. This frustrated model stabilizes a unique spiral spin liquid with a degenerate contour around the $\mathrm{K}$$\{$1/3,1/3$\}$ point in reciprocal space, consistent with our experiments down to 30 mK, including the observation of a giant residual specific heat. Our results establish GdZnPO as an ideal platform for exploring the stability of spiral spin liquids and their novel properties, such as the emergence of low-energy topological defects on the sublattices.</p>

            <h2>Low-energy perspective of interacting electrons in the normal state of superconducting bilayer nickelate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Lechermann, Steffen B√∂tzel, Ilya M. Eremin</p>
            <p>Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.</p>

            <h2>Antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transition-metal nitride Co$_2$N$_2$ layer with high N$\rm \acute{\textbf e}$el temperature and Dirac fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lujia Tian, Lihui Han, Yuanfang Yue, Huazhen Li, Z. Y. Xie, Xun-Wang Yan</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have a wide prospect of applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, materials, etc. However, 2D transition metal nitrides with strong magnetism, especially high N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature, are very scarce. Based on the first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory, we design two 2D transition-metal nitrides \textit{M}$_2$N$_2$ (\textit{M} = Ti, Co), in which the transition metal atoms and the N atoms form a 2D layer with a wrinkled structure. The structural stability is demonstrated by the cohesive energy, formation energy, elastic constants, phonon spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. Elastic moduli calculations reveal that the mechanical properties of the two structures are anisotropic. Spin-polarized calculations show that Ti$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D ferromagnetic material while Co$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D antiferromagnetic semimetal with a Dirac point at Fermi level. Furthermore, by solveing the Heisenberg model by Monte Carlo method, we discover that the 2D Co$_2$N$_2$ layer is a high-temperature antiferromagnetic material and the N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature is up to 474 K. Therefore, our findings provide a rare antiferromagnetic 2D material with both high critical temperature and Dirac Fermions.</p>

            <p>We consider an antiferromagnet in one space dimension with easy-axis anisotropy in a perpendicular magnetic field. We study propagating domain wall solutions that can have a velocity up to a maximum $v_c$. The width of the domain wall is a non-monotonic function of the velocity and it diverges to infinity at $v_c$. Both features are in contrast to the case of the Lorentz invariant model in the absence of the field. We further study the modification of the wall profile when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is added. Finally, we present a propagating spiral expected to form when the system is forced at a velocity higher than the maximum velocity for domain walls and we give numerical results for the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</p>

            <p>Point defects, though atomically small, significantly influence the properties of 2D materials. A general method for characterizing point defect density ($n_{ D }$) in graphenic materials with arbitrary layer number ($n_{ L }$) is currently lacking. Here, we introduce the Graphene Atlas, a non-destructive Raman spectroscopy-based framework for defect quantification in diverse graphenic systems. We demonstrate that the relative fractions of the double-resonance D and 2D Raman bands, which arise from competing scattering processes, exhibit a universal relationship with $n_{ D }$, independent of $n_{ L }$. Plotting Raman data on a plane defined by defect-related and layer number-related parameters enables a direct and quantitative determination of $n_{ D }$ and $n_{ L }$. This Graphene Atlas provides a transformative tool for real-time defect quantification in scalable manufacturing of graphenic materials, bridging fundamental research and industrial applications. This framework establishes a new standard for defect characterization of graphenic systems, facilitating their optimization for advanced technological applications.</p>

            <p>We find a strongly enhanced entanglement within the pseudogap regime of the Hubbard model. This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingze Su, Ruitao Xiao, Junnian Xiong, Hui Li, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li</p>
            <p>In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Effect of surface orientation on blistering of copper under high fluence keV hydrogen ion irradiation</h2>

            <p>Copper and hydrogen are among the most common elements that are widely used in industrial and fundamental research applications. Copper surfaces are often exposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can accelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below the surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can lead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the naked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface. Blisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties of the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using scanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated polycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence. Initially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our experiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to blistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it. Moreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with specific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic simulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific behavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our simulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on surfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence of the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in copper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.</p>

            <p>Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</p>

            <p>This study used Speckle Visibility Spectroscopy to examine velocity fluctuations in a three-dimensional granular heap flow, where the mean velocity profile consists of a fast-flow surface layer and a creep layer beneath. The velocity spectra follow power-law scalings, $E(f) \propto f^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx -0.85$ in the surface flow layer -- matching the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) model with open boundaries ($\alpha \approx -0.95$). In the creep layer, $\alpha$ decreases with depth, reaching $\alpha \approx -1.5$ at approximately 55 mean particle diameters, consistent with the SOC model with closed boundaries ($\alpha \approx -1.58$). Analysis of the fluctuation velocity distributions offers additional insights into the microscopic origins of the spectrum's characteristics. These findings help resolve the long-standing puzzle of flow localization in gravity-driven granular flows despite a constant shear stress-to-pressure ratio throughout the material.</p>

            <p>The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J >0$ and $J' >0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer new perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Impact and spreading dynamics of a drop of fiber suspension on a solid substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeram Rajesh, Alban Sauret</p>
            <p>The presence of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a liquid modifies the impact and spreading dynamics of a drop on a hydrophilic substrate. This difference in spreading dynamics is attributed to the increase in the suspension's viscosity caused by the particles. Similarly, anisotropic non-Brownian particles, such as fibers, also increase the bulk viscosity. In addition to the fiber diameter, D, the length, L, which determines the aspect ratio A = L/D, is crucial in controlling the fiber suspension viscosity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drop impact of fiber suspensions with different volume fractions will result in a similar modification of the spreading dynamics. To investigate the impact and spreading dynamics, we prepared suspensions of fibers with an aspect ratio A = 12 at different volume fractions, spanning the dilute, semi-dilute, and dense concentration regimes. Additionally, we conducted a subset of experiments with aspect ratios A = 4 and A = 20. Furthermore, we characterized the thickness of the resulting droplet film (the coating) and the orientation of fibers after the spreading dynamics reached a steady state. The presence of fibers results in a decrease in the final droplet size, as an increase in volume fraction leads to an increase in the suspension viscosity. To rationalize these results, we used a modified equation, originally developed for spherical particles, which incorporates the suspension viscosity. Furthermore, we observed that volume fraction plays only a weak role in controlling splashing. However, it is crucial in determining the final thickness and resulting fiber coating. We also used a novel approach to quantify the final fiber orientation and showed that the resulting distribution is anisotropic within the quantified range.</p>

            <p>Large-scale simulations are a powerful tool for understanding material behavior and designing new materials. However, the computational limitations of atomistic-scale simulations stemming from constraints in computational power, algorithmic efficiency, and accuracy, prevent us from modeling large systems, even at ground state,(DFT)-level precision. Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature.

This approach complements the length gauge formulation and offers distinct advantages in both numerical and analytical treatments, particularly for atomic and solid-state systems with well-defined momentum-space structures. By applying our framework to the Rabi model, we derive numerical solutions in the velocity gauge and compare them with the length gauge, demonstrating full agreement between the two formulations. Our findings reveal rich optical phenomena, including photon-assisted transitions, frequency mixing effects, and emergent Floquet-induced photocurrents that are absent in static systems. We demonstrate that nonlinear responses in Floquet-driven systems exhibit resonances at integer multiples of the driving frequency, providing insights into ultrafast spectroscopy and Floquet engineering of quantum materials. The present formulation establishes a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in driven quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum optics, photonics, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</p>

Our analysis shows that the broken time-reversal symmetry in a single valley leads to unique features in the weak-tunneling regime that are different for commensurate and incommensurate Cooper pair momenta. We further uncover an unconventional spatial dependence of the Andreev conductance, allowing to distinguish between three topologically distinct classes of single-$\mathbf{q}$ pairing states in the system, and compute the signatures of a competing translational-symmetry breaking three-$\mathbf{q}$ ''moir√© superconductor''.</p>

A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pappu Acharya, Martin Trulsson</p>
            <p>Alternating shear rotations in dense suspensions have recently shown the ability to reduce both viscosity and dissipation per strain (at a fixed global shear rate). Here, we study alternating shear rotation, with extensive numerical simulations, at various angles and up to their corresponding jamming points. For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is continuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles, while it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the alternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for suspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual contributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted for this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact stress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite trend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress will dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation increases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a one-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total stress for both frictionless and frictional particles.</p>

Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</p>

            <h2>Random motility regulation drives the fragmentation of microbial ecosystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Dinelli, Ada Altieri, Julien Tailleur</p>
            <p>The self-organization of microbial ecosystems involves a large variety of mechanisms, ranging from biochemical signaling to population dynamics. Among these, the role of motility regulation has been little studied, despite the importance of active migration processes. Here we show how weak, random motility regulation generically induces the fragmentation of bacterial ecosystems comprising a large number of coexisting strains. To do so, we simulate microscopic models of run-and-tumble bacteria whose self-propulsion speeds are regulated by the local density of each strain. Our simulations reveal that, as the heterogeneity of the interaction network increases, the ecosystem undergoes a phase transition leading to the emergence of distinct communities. To account for these results and assess their robustness, we use random-matrix theory to analyze the hydrodynamic description of the bacterial ecosystem, obtaining a quantitative agreement with our microscopic simulations. Our results are shown to hold for a variety of motility-regulation mechanisms and should be relevant to the study of community formation by motile organisms.</p>

            <h2>Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <h2>Gapless Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries</h2>

            <p>The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module this http URL is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</p>

            <h2>A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Daniel E. Parker, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seunguk Song, Michael Altvater, Wonchan Lee, Hyeon Suk Shin, Nicholas Glavin, Deep Jariwala</p>
            <p>As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (>2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</p>

            <p>The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.</p>

            <p>It has been well recognized that there exist high-density deep states in IGZO thin films. Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS),were understood to be related to these deep states. However, in this work, it is found that deep state density (NtD) of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) IGZO transistors can be an ultra-low value (2.3*10^12 /cm^3) by the proposed NBIS-free light assisted I-V measurements so that the deep states do not affect the I-V characteristics even in subthreshold region. This work also reveals that NBIS is not related to the photoexcitation of electrons in deep states. Our results suggest that the existence of deep states and the impact of deep states on ALD IGZO transistors may need to be revisited.</p>

            <p>We report the systematic synthesis, crystal structure, magnetization, and powder neutron diffraction of single crystalline and polycrystalline CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ samples. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with $Pnma$ space group, featuring chains of edge-shared CoO$_6$ octahedra arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Two antiferromagnetic transitions are observed at $T$$_{N1}$ = 14.4 K and $T$$_{N2}$ = 16.2 K, corresponding to two long-range magnetic orders with propagation vectors of $\bf{k}$$_1$ = (0, 0, 0) and $\bf{k}$$_2$ = (0.125, 0, 0.25), respectively. The ground state is determined as a canted up-up-down-down zigzag spin configuration along the $c$ axis, wherein the magnetic moments of Co1 and Co2 ions are 3.4(1) and 2.1(1)$\mu$$_B$, respectively. Successive spin-flop transitions appear with the increasing magnetic field applied along the easy axis ($c$ axis), accompanied by depression of the antiferromagnetic orders and enhancement of residual magnetic entropy. The field-induced spin-disordered state suggests that CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ may be an ideal candidate for studying frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p>Atomically thin van der Waals materials provide a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena in solid state systems. Due to their remarkable mechanical strength, one enticing tuning knob is strain. However, the weak strain transfer of graphite and hBN, which are standard components of high-qualityvdW devices, poses fundamental challenges for high-strain experiments. Here, we investigate strain transmission in less-explored orthorhombic crystals and find robust transmission up to several percent at cryogenic temperatures. We further show that strain can be efficiently transferred through these crystals to other 2D materials in traditional heterostructure devices. Using this capability, we demonstrate in-situ strain and gate control of the optical properties of monolayer WS2 utilizing the high-\k{appa} dielectric insulator Bi2SeO5 as a substrate. These results enable the exploration of combined cryo-strain and gate tuning in a variety of layered systems such as moir√© heterostructures, air-sensitive 2D magnets and superconductors, and any gated 2D device.</p>

            <p>Long considered the ''poor cousins'' of spin-1/2 systems, magnets built of spin-1 moments have recently come to fore as a rich source of novel phases of matter. Here we explore the phases which arise in a spin-1 magnet on the pyrochlore lattice, once biquadratic interactions are taken into account. Using a combination of variational and Monte Carlo techniques, built around the exact treatment of spin-1 at the level of a single site, we uncover seven distinct spin liquid phases. Dynamical calculations for one of these spin liquids are shown to be in good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1 pyrochlore $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$. These results suggest that the range of spin liquid phases found in spin-1 pyrochlores may be even richer than in materials with (pseudo-)spin-1/2 moments.</p>

            <p>Theoretically, the relative change of the Heisenberg-type nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor coupling $J_2$ in the face-centered-cubic lattice can give rise to three main antiferromagnetic orderings of type-I, type-II, and type-III. However, it is difficult to tune the $J_2/J_1$ ratio in real materials. Here, we report studies on the influence of Te$^{6+}$ and W$^{6+}$ ions replacement to the magnetic interactions and the magnetic ground states in the double-perovskite compounds Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co). For Ba$_2$MnTe$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$, the W$^{6+}$ doping on Te$^{6+}$ site is successful in $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.9$ with short-range orders of the type-I ($0.02 \leq x \leq 0.08$) and type-II ($0.1 \leq x \leq 0.9$). In Ba$_2$CoTe$_{1-x}$W${_x}$O$_6$, x-ray diffraction measurements reveal two crystal structures, including the trigonal phase ($0 \leq x \leq 0.1$) and the cubic phase ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1$), between which is a miscibility gap. Two magnetic transitions are identified in the trigonal phase due to two magnetic subsystems, and the type-II magnetic order is observed in the cubic phase. Magnetic phase diagrams of Ba$_2M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co) are established. Our work shows that the magnetic interactions and ground states of Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ can be tuned effectively by the replacement of Te$^{6+}$ by W$^{6+}$ ions.</p>

This suggests that below the CDW transition temperature, the correlation between localized spins may develop at both ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$. Experimental implications of our result to van der Waals materials $R$Te$_3$ are also discussed.</p>

In this work, we consider finite-time feedback processes in classical discrete systems described by Markov jump processes, and derive achievable bounds on entropy production for feedback processes controlled by Maxwell's demons. The key ingredients of our approach is optimal transport theory and an achievable Fano's inequality, by which we optimize the Wasserstein distance over final distributions under fixed consumed information. Our study reveals the minimum entropy production for consuming a certain amount of information, and moreover, the optimal feedback protocol to achieve it. These results are expected to lead to design principles for information processing in various stochastic systems with discrete states.</p>

            <p>The observation of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime has attracted considerable attention, revealing the coexistence of two seemingly incompatible phases: the quantum Hall and superconducting states. However, the mechanism underlying the Josephson current remains unclear because of the observed h/2e magnetic interference period and the lack of precisely quantized Hall plateaus. To address this issue, we investigate the edge dependence of the Josephson current in graphene Josephson junctions operating in the quantum Hall regime. By systematically comparing devices with native, etched, edge-free, and gate-defined edges, we demonstrate that the Josephson current is confined to the physical edges and is highly sensitive to specific edge configurations. Our findings provide direct evidence that counter-propagating quantum Hall edge states mediate Andreev bound states, enabling Josephson coupling. These results clarify the underlying mechanism of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime and offer new strategies for engineering superconducting hybrid devices.</p>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1¬∞ hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3¬∞, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37¬∞ twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moir√© cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</p>

The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize the designability of floppy chains and frustrated loops to demonstrate matrix-vector multiplication in materia.</p>

            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

            <p>PrAlSi, a non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal candidate with a Curie temperature of 17.8K, offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry breaking and topological electronic structures. Up to now, the Weyl fermion distribution as well as their evolution across the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in PrAlSi has not been explored. Here, we uncover the presence of Weyl fermions in PrAlSi and demonstrate they could be manipulated through the magnetic phase transition. Our ab-initio calculations indicate a shift in the momentum and energy positions of Weyl fermions, alongside an increase in Weyl point numbers due to band splitting. The predicted band splitting and shifting of Weyl fermions are corroborated by our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. Such manipulation of Weyl fermions leads to the appearance of a net chirality charge and a significant modulation in optical conductivity, as proposed by our calculations. Our research presents a novel method for adjusting the properties of Weyl semimetals by controlling Weyl fermions through magnetic phase transitions, positioning PrAlSi as a model system.</p>

            <h2>$3d$ flat bands and coupled $4f$ moments in the kagome-honeycomb permanent magnet Sm$_{2}$Co$_{17}$</h2>

            <p>Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$-300meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.</p>

            <h2>Interplanar magnetic exchange in CoPS$_3$</h2>

            <p>Neutron three-axis spectrometry has been used to determine the interplanar magnetic exchange parameter in the magnetic van der Waals compound CoPS$_3$. The exchange is found to be small and antiferromagnetic, estimated to be 0.020 $\pm$ 0.001 meV, which is surprising considering that the magnetic structure is correlated ferromagnetically between the ab planes. A possible explanation, involving a small anisotropy in the exchanges, is proposed. The results are discussed with reference to the other members of the transition metal-PS3 compounds.</p>

            <h2>Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Structural Transition in Cluster Mott Insulator Candidate Nb3Cl8 Revealed by 93Nb- and 35Cl-NMR</h2>

            <p>Motivated by recent studies of the cluster Mott insulator candidate compound Nb3Cl8, this study performs 93Nb and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to investigate the electron correlations. Below the structural transition temperature Ts ~ 97 K, all satellites of the 93Nb NMR spectra split into three distinct peaks, which suggests symmetry lowering due to the structural transition and could be attributed to the change in the Nb-Nb bond-lengths of the Nb3 clusters. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 divided by the temperature T, 1/T1T, increases upon cooling to Ts for all Cl sites, whereas only the Knight shift K of Cl located at the center of the Nb3 clusters exhibits a temperature dependence similar to that observed in magnetic susceptibility. These findings collectively demonstrate the existence of strong spin correlations between the Nb atoms in Nb3Cl8, which are closely associated with Mottness.</p>

            <h2>Chiral magnon splitting in altermagnetic CrSb from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Zhang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Ke Chen, Kun Cao</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has been proposed as a new type of magnetism, simultaneously exhibiting compensated spin moments in real space and spin-split electronic bands in reciprocal space. Alternating chiral magnon splitting is considered a unique feature of altermagnets. In this work, utilizing linear spin wave theory (LSWT), which is based on a localized spin picture and itinerant time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TD-DFPT), we investigate the spin fluctuation spectra of altermagnetic CrSb. Along the L-$\Gamma$-L$^{\prime}$ path, the LSWT provides a chiral magnon splitting of up to 9 meV, located at high excitation energies around 140 meV, which is identified to be primarily driven by the splitting of two long-range exchange interactions, with exchange paths along the body diagonal lines of the unit cell. On the other hand, the more realistic TD-DFPT obtains more significant splitting of $\sim$ 30 meV at maximum. However, the splitting is severely smeared out due to strong Landau damping from the Stoner continuum, which may make it difficult to observe experimentally, e.g. through inelastic neutron scattering. We further provide a brief discussion on the connection between the Stoner excitations and the chiral magnon splitting.</p>

            <h2>Unified mechanism of charge-density-wave and high-$T_c$ superconductivity protected from oxygen vacancies in bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daisuke Inoue, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Unconventional charge and spin density-wave states are commonly observed in bilayer nickelates, drawing considerable attention due to their proximity to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in various phase diagrams. However, the nature and mechanisms of charge and spin density-waves (DWs) in nickelates remain poorly understood. Numerous experiments have reported that the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition temperature $T_{ cdw}$ and the spin-density-wave (SDW) transition temperature $T_{sdw}$ are closely related but distinct. However, in contrast to these experiments, previous mean-field-type analyses have yielded only a simple SDW phase. To resolve this key problem, this paper demonstrates that sizable CDW instabilities emerge in proportion to the SDW instability in La$3$Ni$2$O$7$.This behavior is driven by the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism, which captures important electron correlations beyond mean-field theory. Therefore, (i) experimental CDW + SDW coexisting state is naturally explained. In addition, (ii) the CDW + SDW fluctuations cooperatively drive high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Notably, the predicted $s$-wave SC state is robust against the inner apical O vacancies. Furthermore, (iii) the CDW instability is highly sensitive to the size of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital hole pocket, allowing for the realization of CDW quantum criticality through carrier-doping and pressure application. We find that the coexistence of charge and spin fluctuations is essential in bilayer nickelates, with both playing a cooperative role in mediating high-$T_c$ superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Patil, Owen Benton</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</p>

            <h2>Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Taniguchi</p>
            <p>Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.</p>

            <h2>Entropic bottlenecks to nematic ordering in an $RP^{2}$ apolar spin model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Kamala Latha, V. S. S. Sastry, S. R. Shenoy</p>
            <p>The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.</p>

            <p>Interfacing complex oxides in atomically engineered layered structures can give rise to a wealth of exceptional electronic and magnetic properties that surpass those of the individual building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic spin order with a high Curie temperature of 608 K in superlattices consisting of otherwise paramagnetic perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) and antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 (LFO). The extraordinary ferromagnetism likely results from the covalent exchange due to interfacial charge transfer from Fe to Ni cations. By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus the amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for a stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO, an emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential for the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as well as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the Extraction of Coupling Strength for Polaron Hopping from $ab~initio$ Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hala Houmsi, Benoit Skl√©nard, Marc Guillaumont, Fran√ßois Triozon, Jing Li</p>
            <p>Accurately determining the coupling strength between polaron states is essential to describe charge-hopping transport in materials. In this work, we revisit methodologies to extract coupling strengths using ab initio approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of incorporating anharmonic effects in the model Hamiltonian when analyzing total energy variations along reaction coordinates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling strength extraction based on total energy calculated from ab initio approaches is fundamentally limited due to the stabilization of diabatic states, which do not involve coupling strength. We demonstrate that such limitation exists in both DFT+U and HSE hybrid functionals, which are widely used in the study of polaron transport. Instead, we suggest extracting coupling strength directly from the electronic structure of a system in neutral conditions. The neutral condition avoids overestimating coupling strength due to additional energy splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states from the charging energy. This study highlights the limitations of existing methods and introduces a robust framework for accurately extracting coupling parameters, paving the way for improved modeling of charge transport in complex materials.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic mechanisms of flexoelectricity in oxide membranes</h2>

            <p>Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic conductors with suitably broken spatial symmetries host spin-polarized bands, which lead to transport phenomena commonly observed in metallic ferromagnets. In bulk materials, it is the given crystalline structure that determines whether symmetries are broken and spin-polarized bands are present. Here we demonstrate experimentally that double-gate transistors realized on bilayers of van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4 allow the relevant symmetry to be controlled by a perpendicular electric displacement field. Such a level of control enables the spin-polarization of the conduction band to be switched on and off. Because conduction band states with opposite spin-polarizations are hosted in the different layers and are spatially separated, these devices also give control over the magnetization of the electrons that are accumulated electrostatically. Our experiments show that double-gated CrPS4 transistors provide a viable platform to create gate-induced conductors with near unity spin polarization at the Fermi level, as well as devices with a full electrostatic control of the total magnetization of the system.</p>

            <p>Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchi Monga, Saswata Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>The mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional materials has sparked significant interest in the study of low-dimensional structures. In this work, we investigate the bulk and low-dimensional derivatives of BiSeI, a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic crystal known for its remarkable stability and novel electronic properties. Using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we examine the influence of dimensionality on their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties. Quasi-particle $\mathit{G_0W_0}$ calculations reveal a significant increase in the band gap with a decrease in dimensionality, driven by quantum confinement effects and reduced dielectric screening. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we identify a transition from weakly bound Wannier-Mott excitons in bulk BiSeI to strongly bound excitons its low-dimensional forms. These structures feature band gaps spanning the infrared to the visible spectrum and exhibit large exciton binding energies, making them promising for next-generation optoelectronics and excitonic applications. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for future experimental studies on BiSeI and its low-dimensional counterparts.</p>

            <p>Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are foundational to advance the electronics and electric power devices due to their ultrafast charging/discharging capability and high-power density. However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</p>

            <p>Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.</p>

For microscopic particles driven across a sinusoidal potential, integer Shapiro steps have been observed.

Measuring the particle position via individual particle tracking, we reveal the underlying microscopic mechanisms that produce integer and fractional steps and demonstrate how these steps can be controlled by tuning the shape and driving protocol of the optical potential. The flexibility offered by optical engineering allows us to generate wide ranges of potential shapes and to study, at the single-particle level, synchronization behavior in driven soft condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting the voltage of battery materials is essential for advancing energy storage technologies and designing more efficient, high-performance batteries. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the average voltage of materials used in Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from the Materials Project, incorporating a diverse set of features, including structural, physical, chemical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties, along with battery-specific descriptors. These features were utilized to construct a robust DNN model aimed at facilitating the discovery of novel battery materials. The model performance evaluated through 10-fold cross validation achieving an R$^2$ value of 0.99 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.069 V on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability to capture the complex relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that machine learning approaches, particularly DNN models, can provide rapid and reliable voltage predictions without relying on computationally expensive first-principles calculations. This research shows how systematic data analysis can accelerate the identification and improvement of next-generation battery materials. By focusing on key material properties and using computational methods, our study lays the groundwork for faster development of new energy storage solutions.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical transmission to determine concentration-dependent hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energies of thin metallic glass films over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations. The hydrogen concentration's temporal and spatial profiles are simultaneously extracted without requiring a metal-insulator transition or hydride formation. The concentration-dependent activation energy is extracted and is found to exhibit similar concentration dependence as hydrogen in the disordered bulk alpha-phase of vanadium. The activation energy is in stark contrast, however, to the activation energy found in epitaxial vanadium films of similar thickness. The chemical diffusion increases with hydrogen concentration in the glass, whereas it decreases in the crystalline case owing to the differences in the thermodynamic factors. This technique provides detailed insight into the concentration dependence of hydrogen diffusion and constrains theories treating correlated motion of hydrogen and short-range hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. The method can be applied to other materials that show an optical response to hydrogen uptake.</p>

The Cooper-pair wavefunction and its typical characteristics are given. It is this universal picture, confirmed through diverse experimental evidence, most notably the STM tunneling constant-current image on the CuO$_2$ plane combining with the ultra-small Cooper-pair size as an ironclad proof, that determines the unconventional high-T$_c$ superconductivity of oxide superconductors. According to our e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, the room-temperature electron (hole) pairing can be realized in ionic oxides, laying a key foundation for achieving the room-temperature superconductivity, and bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductors one step closer.</p>

            <p>Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate three-body loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yao Yang, Jinxiong Jia, Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Hao Jin</p>
            <p>Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic materials. Here, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The x-direction component of SC component is observed to have an ferroicity-driven switch. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Gate electrode-induced nonreciprocal resistance in topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofie K√∂lling, Florian R. Westerhof, Alexander Brinkman</p>
            <p>A common method of controlling the chemical potential in topological insulators is applying a gate electrode. Simultaneously applying high source-drain bias currents can lead to parasitic effects in such devices. We derive that these parasitic effects lead to a gradient in the Hall effect along the current lead of a Hall bar. Consequently, nonreciprocal effects in both longitudinal and Hall voltages appear upon reversing the bias. These effects scale similarly to the magnetochiral anisotropy, requiring detailed analysis to make a distinction. Experimentally we show that nonreciprocal effects can appear in materials where magnetochiral anisotropy is not expected while a top gate is present. Without gate electrode, this nonreciprocal effect is found to be absent. These results show the importance of considering and, if possible, excluding gate electrode-induced effects when searching for nonreciprocal resistance intrinsic to a material.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Disorder on the Energy Landscape and Motional Mechanisms Involved in Lithium Ion Dynamics and Transport in Solid Electrolytes: Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Argyrodite as a Case Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ali Badragheh, Vanessa Mi√ü, Bernhard Roling, Michael Vogel</p>
            <p>7Li NMR diffusometry and relaxometry are combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to compare the mechanisms for the dynamics and transport of lithium ions in disordered and crystalline electrolytes with argyrodite composition Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. The dc conductivity of a disordered sample prepared by ball milling amounts to 0.76 mScm-1 at room temperature, which is substantially lower than that of two previously studied crystalline argyrodites differing in the order of the anion sublattice due to various heat treatments. However, the activation energy of the dc conductivity is smaller for ball-milled disordered Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (E_dc= 0.35 eV) than for both crystalline compounds (E_dc= 0.38 eV). 7Li NMR field-gradient measurements of the self-diffusion coefficient D and its activation energy E_D confirm these findings and, furthermore, reveal different Haven ratios. 7Li NMR field-cycling relaxometry shows that the lithium ion jumps in ball-milled Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 are described by very broad dynamical susceptibilities arising from a temperature-independent Gaussian-like distribution of activation energies g(E_a) with a mean value of E_m= 0.43 eV, while the susceptibilities indicated a high-energy cutoff for the crystalline electrolytes. Based on different relations between the activation energies for the conductivity, diffusivity and jumps, we discuss that the shape and exploration of the energy landscapes of ball-milled and crystalline Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 samples strongly differ. Moreover, significant differences in the preexponential factor of the dc conductivity, the Haven ratio and the single-particle correlation factor point to distinct types of anion lattice disorder of the ball-milled disordered and heat-treated crystalline samples.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe$_2$ have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic fields.</p>

We provide realistic parameters for observing the negative currents in an experiment and show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Cameron, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer high efficiency and low costs, making them key for future photovoltaics. Optimizing charge transport layers is crucial, with porous TiO$_2$ widely used as electron transport layers (ETL) due to its energy alignment, transparency, and abundance. However, its efficiency relies on crystallinity requiring high-temperature processing (>450$^\circ$C), increasing costs and limiting flexible substrates. Low-temperature wet-chemical methods face scalability issues due to material waste and hazardous solvents. In this context, plasma-based technologies are emerging as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to oxide-based ETLs. This study presents the synthesis of TiO$_2$ layers using an advanced plasma method combining remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) and soft plasma etching (SPE) at mild temperatures (<200$^\circ$C), allowing control of microstructure and porosity. The resulting nanocolumnar film, decorated with a highly porous aerogel-like layer, enhances optical and electronic properties. These plasma-synthesized TiO$_2$ layers are antireflective and improve the efficiency in porous n-i-p PSCs, matching the performance of high-temperature reference cells. These PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 14.6%, a high value compared to reference devices synthesized at 450¬∞C. Impedance spectroscopy confirms high recombination resistance and stable capacitance, linked to improved perovskite crystallinity. Our results highlight the potential of the RPAVD+SPE approach for producing low-temperature efficient ETLs, providing a feasible, industrially scalable, and eco-friendly alternative for manufacturing flexible, high-performance photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <h2>Unprecedented superionicity of ultra-low barrier in A0.5CoO2 (A=Li, Zn)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuechen Wang, Yaxin Gao, Menghao Wu</p>
            <p>The ion conductivity of a solid-state ion conductor generally increases exponentially upon reduction in ion migration barrier. For prevalent cathode material LiCoO2, the room-temperature ion conductivity and migration barrier are respectively around 10-4 S/cm and 0.3 eV. In this paper, through first-principles calculations we predict the existence of 1D superionicity as the Li ions in O2 LiCoO2 are transformed to Zn0.5CoO2 or Li0.5CoO2 via cation-exchange reaction or deintercalation. The ion migration barriers (0.01-0.02 eV) even lower than room-temperature ~kBT are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with LiCoO2, which are facilitated by facile transition of mobile ions between two coordination configurations. The room-temperature ion conductivity is estimated to be over 50 S/cm, enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with current highest reported value. Such unprecedented superionicity may also exist in other similar layered ion conductors, which may render technical advances and exotic effects such as ultrafast ion batteries and quantized ferroelectricity.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric composites integrate the coupling between magnetic and piezoelectric materials to create new functionalities for potential technological applications. This coupling is typically achieved through the exchange of magnetic, electric, or elastic energy across the interfaces between the different constituent materials. Tailoring the strength of the magnetoelectric effect is primarily accomplished by selecting suitable materials for each constituent and by optimizing geometrical and microstructural designs. Various composite architectures, such as (0-3), (2-2), (1-3) and core-shell connectivities, have been studied to enhance magnetoelectric coupling and other required physical properties in composites. This review examines the latest advancements in magnetoelectric materials, focusing on the impact of different interphase connectivity types on their properties and performance. Before exploring magnetic-electric coupling, a brief overview of the historical background of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is provided. Fundamental concepts underlying the magnetoelectric effect, piezoelectricity, and the magnetostrictive effect are explained, including their origins and examples of these materials' properties. So far, three types of magnetoelectric composite connectivities have been investigated experimentally: particulate composites (0-3), laminated and thin films (2-2), sticks embedded in matrix, core-shell particles, and coaxial fibers. An outlook on the prospects and scientific challenges in the field of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is given at the end of this review.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has established a novel platform for studying unconventional superconductors. However, achieving superconductivity in this system currently requires relatively high pressures. In this study, we propose a chemical pressure strategy via Sr substitution to stabilize high-Tc superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient this http URL density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1) at ambient pressure and identify two dynamically stable phases:La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$.Our calculations reveal that both phases exhibit metallization of the $\sigma$-bonding bands dominated by Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals-a key feature associated with high-Tc superconductivity, as reported in the high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Further analysis using tight-binding models shows that the key hopping parameters in La$_{2.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_7$ closely resemble those of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, indicating that strong super-exchange interactions between interlayer Ni-d$_{z^{2}}$ orbitals are preserved. These findings suggest that Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a promising candidate for realizing high-Tcsuperconductivity at ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong this http URL of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Transition metal molybdenum oxides A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co) are known to be polar magnets where A ions are located in either octahedrally or tetrahedrally coordinated sites. In this paper we predict that their polarizations can be reversed via swapping of two coordinations for A ions, giving rise to robust vertical ferroelectricity. Such unique ferroelectricity via coordination swapping can be used to control the Neel vector in altermagnetic Fe2Mo3O8, while the large non-relativistic spin-splittings can be also altered by ferroelectric switching in Luttinger compensated magnetic Mn2Mo3O8, both in the absence of net magnetization. However, their ultra-thin layers may possess net magnetizations that can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching. Our findings provide a new type of multiferroicity as well as a new avenue in control of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</p>

            <p>It is known that the topological Hopf term in two-dimensional (2D) spin systems can be derived by coupling to massless Dirac fermions. In an earlier work, we realized the Hopf term in a four-band lattice model. The key difficulty is avoiding canclation of the topological term contributed from different cones. In the present work, we provide general rules for obtaining nonzero Hopf term in spin systems when coupling to Dirac fermions. This method allows to direct dectation of the coefficient of the Hopf term without detailed calculations from path integral. We apply this framework to several models and verify that our results are self-consistent. Especially, we design a simple two-cone model on the checkerboard lattice and demonstrate how it realizes the Hopf term according to the above rules.</p>

Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion measurements reveal two uranium-driven antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=29$~K and $T_{N2}=24$~K, a complex field-temperature phase diagram, and unusual negative domain wall magnetoresistance. Specific heat measurements unveil a modest Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 40$~mJ/mol.K$^{2}$, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements that show a moderate $f$-electron enhancement at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$).

The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p>

While optical frequency comb sources constitute a well-established technology, superconducting circuits provide a relatively unexplored on-chip platform for low-dissipation comb emitters able to span from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate coherent microwave frequency comb generation by leveraging the ac Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum interference device. A time-dependent magnetic drive periodically generates voltage pulses, which in the frequency domain correspond to a comb with dozens of spectral modes. The micrometer-scale footprint and minimal dissipation inherent to superconducting systems foster the integration of our comb generator with advanced cryogenic electronics. Transferring optical techniques to the solid-state domain may enable new applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams could be a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their properties such as ultralightweight, huge volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that the charge-storage of carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by the wettability, surface area, and porosity of carbon nanostructures. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced around fifty times and the widened voltage of the device increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, although observed in previous literatures but unexplained, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser-deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</p>

The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.</p>

            <p>Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</p>

            <h2>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</h2>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p>Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.</p>

            <p>As a fundamental physical phenomenon, achieving and controlling a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is crucial for advancing the understanding of topological physics and for developing applied technologies in spintronics. The recently discovered topological Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =$ K, Rb, Cs)exhibits a significant AHE along with charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, providing an ideal platform to study the interactions between nontrivial band topology, CDW, and superconductivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the evolution of CDW, superconductivity, and AHE in electron (Mn)-doped Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. The experimental results show that electron doping rapidly suppresses superconductivity, while the CDW order remains relatively robust. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced AHE, with a maximum anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ~25331 \Ohm ^{-1}\cm^{-1} and an anomalous Hall angle of 6.66% occurs at a relatively low doping level of $x = 0.03$. Based on the Tian-Ye-Jin (TYJ) scaling model, such a significant enhancement AHC is mainly dominated by the skew scattering. We speculated enhanced skew scattering between electrons and Mn originating from the strengthened spin-orbital coupling. Our finding provides important guidance for the design and development of transverse transport properties in topological Kagome materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</p>

            <p>Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>Marrying the predictive power of ab initio calculations with many-body effects remains a challenging task in two-dimensional (2d) materials, where efficient carrier-carrier interaction challenges established approximation schemes. In particular, understanding exciton-phonon interaction from first principles is a field of growing interest. Here, we present a many-body theory for coupled free-carrier, exciton, phonon and photon dynamics based on carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interaction matrix elements obtained via projection on Wannier orbitals. The framework is applied to study the impact of carrier-phonon correlations on optical spectra and coupled nonequilibrium carrier-phonon kinetics in monolayer MoSe$_2$. We find that non-Markovian effects and dynamical buildup of quasi-particles are only properly described if correlations at least on the two-phonon level are included. Our studies open a perspective to advance the material-realistic description of nonequilibrium physics in 2d nanostructures to new many-body realms.</p>

The moir√© band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.</p>

Among these methods, depositing electrical contacts to the channel material is fundamental to device characterization. Novel layered and two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising for next-generation computing electronic channel materials. Direct-write printing of conductive inks is introduced as a surprisingly effective, significantly faster, and cleaner method to contact different classes of layered materials, including graphene (semi-metal), MoS2 (semiconductor), Bi-2212 (superconductor), and Fe5GeTe2 (metallic ferromagnet). Based on the electrical response, the quality of the printed contacts is comparable to what is achievable with resist-based lithography techniques. These devices are tested by sweeping gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field to show that the materials remain pristine post-processing. This work demonstrates that direct-write printing is an agile method for prototyping and characterizing the electrical properties of novel layered materials.</p>

            <p>Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</p>

            <p>Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</p>

            <p>This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.</p>

            <p>Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</p>

            <p>In spaces of three or more dimensions, there exists topological physics of significant richness that has no lower-dimensional counterparts. To experimentally explore high-dimensional physics, it is advantageous to augment the physical space with synthetic dimensions. An emerging approach is to use a single modulated photonic ring resonator to form multiple synthetic frequency dimensions. However, all the high-dimensional Hamiltonians experimentally demonstrated in this approach are topologically trivial. Here we propose a general scheme to create high-dimensional topological physics using multiple synthetic frequency dimensions in a single ring resonator. This scheme utilizes specifically designed mode-selective modulations and mode conversions to create non-trivial topology. As examples, we numerically demonstrate a three-dimensional, two-band model exhibiting Weyl points and topological insulator phases, and a five-dimensional, four-band model exhibiting Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces. Our results will facilitate the experimental studies and future applications of topological physics in high dimensions.</p>

Here we consider a chain of parametrically-driven quantum resonators coupled only via weak nearest-neighbour cross-Kerr interaction, without any quadratic tunneling term. We show that, when the drive overcomes a critical threshold value, the system undergoes a transition from the atomic limit of decoupled oscillators to a symmetry-broken topological phase. The topology is dictated by the structure of the Kerr nonlinearity, yielding a non-trivial bulk-boundary correspondence. In the topological phase, we find different effective models for periodic and open boundary conditions and derive analytical approximations for the low-energy spectrum, identifying the conditions to observe topological edge modes.</p>

We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of qubit parameters is critical for the successful implementation of quantum information and computation applications. In solid state systems, the parameters of individual qubits vary across the entire system, requiring time consuming measurements and manual fitting processes for characterization. Recent developed superconducting qubits, such as fluxonium or 0-pi qubits, offer improved fidelity operations but exhibit a more complex physical and spectral structure, complicating parameter extraction. In this work, we propose a machine learning (ML)based methodology for the automatic and accurate characterization of fluxonium qubit parameters. Our approach utilized the energy spectrum calculated by a model Hamiltonian with various magnetic fields, as training data for the ML model. The output consists of the essential fluxonium qubit energy parameters, EJ, EC, and EL in Hamiltonian. The ML model achieves remarkable accuracy (with an average accuracy 95.6%) as an initial guess, enabling the development of an automatic fitting procedure for direct application to realistic experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate that similar accuracy can be retrieved even when the input experimental spectrum is noisy or incomplete, highlighting the model robustness. These results suggest that our automated characterization method, based on a transfer learning approach, provides a reliable framework for future extensions to other superconducting qubits or different solid-state systems. Ultimately, we believe this methodology paves the way for the construction of large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Cupo, Shuanglong Liu, Silas Hoffman, X.-G. Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</p>

            <p>Developing optimal strategies to calibrate quantum processors for high-fidelity operation is one of the outstanding challenges in quantum computing today. Here, we demonstrate multiple examples of high-fidelity operations achieved using a unified global optimization-driven automated calibration routine on a six dot semiconductor quantum processor. Within the same algorithmic framework we optimize readout, shuttling and single-qubit quantum gates by tailoring task-specific cost functions and tuning parameters based on the underlying physics of each operation. Our approach reaches systematically $99\%$ readout fidelity, $>99\%$ shuttling fidelity over an effective distance of 10$\mu$m, and $>99.5\%$ single-qubit gate fidelity on timescales similar or shorter compared to those of expert human operators. The flexibility of our gradient-free closed loop algorithmic procedure allows for seamless application across diverse qubit functionalities while providing a systematic framework to tune-up semiconductor quantum devices and enabling interpretability of the identified optimal operation points.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging Vision Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for Automated Data Extraction from Plots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan</p>
            <p>Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.</p>

            <h2>On-demand manipulation of superbunching emission from colloidal quantum dots and its application in noise-resistance correlated biphoton imaging</h2>

            <p>Superbunching effect with second-order correlations larger than 2, $g^{(2)}(0)>2$, indicating the N-photon bundles emission and strong correlation among photons, has a broad range of fascinating applications in quantum illumination, communication, and computation. However, the on-demand manipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under pulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and lab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the evolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo simulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon statistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from sub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) <1$) to superbunching emission, with the maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation, respectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the coincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the stray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of single colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI with reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise up to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the counts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly desired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.</p>

            <p>The BeEST experiment is measuring the ${}^{7}$Li recoil spectrum from the decay of ${}^{7}$Be implanted into Ta-based sensors to provide the most stringent limits on the existence of sterile neutrinos in the sub-MeV mass range. Its sensitivity is limited by spectral broadening due to interactions between the atomic shell of the ${}^{7}$Be/${}^{7}$Li and the Ta sensor film. This study is investigating the suitability of Nb as an alternative sensor material by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) of ${}^{7}$Li-implanted Nb films. STEM does not detect any change in the microstructure of polycrystalline Nb due to ${}^{7}$Li implantation. APT reveals some segregation of ${}^{7}$Li at grain boundaries in Nb. While this may slightly alter the ${}^{7}$Li binding energies, the effect on the recoil spectrum is not expected to be strong enough to preclude using Nb-based detectors in future phases of the BeEST experiment.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a quantum-informed reduction algorithm for the maximum independent set problem that integrates classical kernelization techniques with information extracted from quantum devices. Our larger framework consists of dedicated application, algorithm, and hardware layers, and easily generalizes to the maximum weight independent set problem. In this hybrid quantum-classical framework, which we call qReduMIS, the quantum computer is used as a co-processor to inform classical reduction logic about frozen vertices that are likely (or unlikely) to be in large independent sets, thereby opening up the reduction space after removal of targeted subgraphs. We systematically assess the performance of qReduMIS based on experiments with up to 231 qubits run on Rydberg quantum hardware available through Amazon Braket. Our experiments show that qReduMIS can help address fundamental performance limitations faced by a broad set of (quantum) solvers including Rydberg quantum devices. We outline implementations of qReduMIS with alternative platforms, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, and we discuss potential future extensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Teng, Orazio Scarlatella, Shiyu Zhou, Armin Rahmani, Claudio Chamon, Claudio Castelnovo</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence is a crucial resource in achieving quantum advantage over classical information processing, and more generally developing new quantum technologies. While its effects are observable in current quantum platforms, there are no standardized tools for systematically measuring and quantifying multi-qubit coherence across different gate-based quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to define a many-body quantum coherence length scale using anyon interference effects in a spin-chain setup, which effectively mirrors the problem of a quantum particle on a ring, with or without flux through it. We propose using the maximum length of the ring for which the presence or absence of flux can be clearly discerned, as a simple measure of the many-body quantum coherence grade (Q-grade) in a given quantum hardware. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented on gate-based quantum platforms to estimate and compare the quantum coherence of current devices, such as those from Google, IBM, IonQ, IQM, and Quantinuum that we considered here. This work aims to contribute to the creation of a live Web interface where the latest developments and advancements can be demonstrated, and progress in quantum coherence resources tracked over time. Establishing such a standardized quantum test would enable monitoring the growth of quantum coherence in gate-based quantum platforms, in a spirit similar to Moore's law.</p>

            <p>Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</p>

            <h2>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $Œ©$-spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yosuke Kubota</p>
            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L√ºck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo A. Lessa, Shengqi Sang, Tsung-Cheng Lu, Timothy H. Hsieh, Chong Wang</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such symmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in mixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod out'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in long-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries of a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics) are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general procedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby symmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the input state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove that states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit long-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their topological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of topological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between higher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a robust quantum control framework that enables high-fidelity gate operations in semiconductor spin qubit systems with always-on couplings. Always-on interactions between qubits pose a fundamental challenge for quantum processors by inducing correlated errors that can trigger chaotic dynamics. Our approach suppresses both static coupling noise and time-dependent crosstalk without requiring high on/off ratio tunable couplers. Significantly, these pulses also prevent the emergence of chaotic entanglement growth in deep quantum circuits, preserving coherence in large multi-qubit systems. By relaxing hardware constraints on coupling control, our method provides a practical path toward scaling semiconductor quantum processors within existing fabrication capabilities, with particular relevance for silicon spin qubit architectures where high-contrast coupling modulation remains challenging.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500¬∞C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</p>

            <h2>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions II: Covariance Matrix Dynamics for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field and Effects of Dielectric on Atom-Field Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schr√∂dinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.</p>

            <p>While the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics ignites a worldwide discussion on the origins of neural networks and their foundational links to physics, modern machine learning research predominantly focuses on computational and algorithmic advancements, overlooking a picture of physics. Here we introduce the concept of entropy into neural networks by reconceptualizing them as hypothetical physical systems where each parameter is a non-interacting 'particle' within a one-dimensional space. By employing a Wang-Landau algorithms, we construct the neural networks' (with up to 1 million parameters) entropy landscapes as functions of training loss and test accuracy (or loss) across four distinct machine learning tasks, including arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of \textit{entropy advantage}, where the high-entropy states generally outperform the states reached via classical training optimizer like stochastic gradient descent. We also find this advantage is more pronounced in narrower networks, indicating a need of different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of neural networks.</p>

            <p>Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.</p>

For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camille Roy, Simone Frasca, Pasquale Scarlino</p>
            <p>Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.</p>

The ground states host Majorana zero modes (MZM) at the edges of the circuit. On top of each of the two ground states, the system exhibits localized bound states at both edges, which are topologically protected against small disorder in the bulk. The spectrum of these boundary excitations should be observable in a circuit-QED experiment with feasible parameter choices.</p>

Furthermore, we propose a reduced order dynamical deterministic model for active turbulence, inspired to shell models for classical turbulence, whose numerical and analytical study confirms the spectrum powerlaw observed in the simulations and reveals hints of a non-Gaussian, intermittent, physics of active turbulence. Direct numerical simulations and modelling also agree in pointing to a phenomenological picture whereby, in the absence of an energy cascade √† la Richardson forbidden by the low Reynolds number regime, it is the coupling between fluid velocity gradients and bacterial orientation that gives rise to a multiscale dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Zhang, D. M. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong</p>
            <p>The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase this http URL further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately this http URL constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Chiral Metal near a Kondo Breakdown Quantum Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Drechsler, Matthias Vojta</p>
            <p>The destruction of the Kondo effect in a local-moment metal can lead to a topological non-Fermi-liquid phase, dubbed fractionalized Fermi liquid, with spinon-type excitations and an emergent gauge field. We demonstrate that, if the latter displays an internal $\pi$-flux structure, a chiral heavy-fermion metal emerges near the Kondo-breakdown transition. Utilizing a parton mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital antiferromagnet, and we derive a Landau-type theory which shows that such a phase generically emerges from a $\pi$-flux spin liquid. We discuss the relevance to pertinent experiments.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Injection and Transport of Coherent Magnons in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer</p>
            <p>Non-collinear antiferromagnets (nAFMs) with a small net magnetic moment offer new opportunities for ultrafast spintronic devices, owing to unique physical properties. While in ferromagnets and collinear AFMs the spin current polarization is locked to the magnetization $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ and N√©el vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ directions, we predict that magnon spin currents injected by metal contacts into nAFMs can be polarized with both $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ components when carried by a coherent superposition of magnon eigenstates. The spin injection efficiency is governed by an interface spin conductance tensor that depends on the non-collinear magnetic texture. While the $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$-component diffuses freely into the nAFM, the $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$-component oscillates as a function of distance from the injector and applied magnetic field, analogous to the Hanle effect of electron spins in metals. Our findings reveal the potential of nAFMs as platforms for the study of tensorial coherent spin transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sylvia K. Lewin, Corey E. Frank, Sheng Ran, Johnpierre Paglione, Nicholas P. Butch</p>
            <p>Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) is recognized as a host material to unconventional spin-triplet superconductivity, but it also exhibits a wealth of additional unusual behavior at high magnetic fields. One of the most prominent signatures of the unconventional superconductivity is a large and anisotropic upper critical field that exceeds the paramagnetic limit. This superconductivity survives to 35 T and is bounded by a discontinuous magnetic transition, which itself is also field-direction-dependent. A different, reentrant superconducting phase emerges only on the high-field side of the magnetic transition, in a range of angles between the crystallographic $b$ and $c$ axes. This review discusses the current state of knowledge of these high-field phases, the high-field behavior of the heavy fermion normal state, and other phases that are stabilized by applied pressure.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi</p>
            <p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust boundary Luttinger surfaces in topological band structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Andrieux</p>
            <p>The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary L. Stevens-Hough, Matthew J. Davis, Lewis A. Williamson</p>
            <p>In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</p>

            <h2>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su, Ivar Martin</p>
            <p>Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Z√ºndel, Leonardo Mazza, L√©onie Canet, Anna Minguzzi</p>
            <p>We investigate the correlation properties in the steady state of driven-dissipative interacting bosonic systems in the quantum regime, as for example non-linear photonic cavities. Specifically, we consider the Bose-Hubbard model on a periodic chain and with spatially homogeneous one-body loss and pump within the Markovian approximation. The steady state is non-thermal and is formally equivalent to an infinite-temperature state with finite chemical potential set by the dissipative parameters. While there is no effect of interactions on the steady state, we observe a nontrivial behaviour of the space-time two-point correlation function, obtained by exact diagonalisation. In particular, we find that the decay width of the propagator is not only renormalised at increasing interactions, as it is the case of a single non-linear resonator, but also at increasing hopping strength. Furthermore, we numerically predict at large interactions a plateau value of the decay rate which goes beyond perturbative results in the interaction strength. We then compute the full spectral function, finding that it contains both a dispersive free-particle like dispersion at low energy and a doublon branch at energy corresponding to the on-site interactions. We compare with the corresponding calculation for the ground state of a closed quantum system and show that the driven-dissipative nature -- determining both the steady state and the dynamical evolution -- changes the low-lying part of the spectrum, where noticeably, the dispersion is quadratic instead of linear at small wavevectors. Finally, we compare to a high temperature grand-canonical equilibrium state and show the difference with respect to the open system stemming from the additional degree of freedom of the dissipation that allows one to vary the width of the dispersion lines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir√© bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir√© band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</p>

            <p>InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. These QWs rely on InGaAs cladding layers and InAlAs barrier layers to confine electrons within a thin InAs well. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As cladding layers, grown on In$_{0.81}$Al$_{0.19}$As barrier layers, to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Carlos Pelayo, George Bougas, Thom√°s Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Simeon I. Mistakidis</p>
            <p>We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</p>

            <h2>Learning Physics-Consistent Material Behavior from Dynamic Displacements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Han, Mohit Pundir, Olga Fink, David S. Kammer</p>
            <p>Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. However, discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed to learn the constitutive law from deformation data. Nonetheless, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on boundary force data for training which are unavailable in many in-situ scenarios. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to learn physics-consistent constitutive relations solely from material deformation without boundary force information. This is achieved by considering a dynamic formulation rather than static equilibrium data and applying an input convex neural network (ICNN). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of hyperelastic material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations. It is, due to its design based on dynamics, particularly suited for applications to strain-rate-dependent materials and situations where constitutive laws need to be inferred from in-situ measurements without access to global force data.</p>

            <p>High-$T_c$ cuprates are characterized by strong spin fluctuations, which give rise to antiferromagnetic and pseudogap phases and may be key to the high superconducting critical temperatures observed in these materials. Experimental studies have revealed significant changes in the Hall coefficient $R_H$ across these phases, a phenomenon closely related to both spin fluctuations and changes in the Fermi surface morphology. Using the perturbation correction to Gaussian approximation (PCGA), we investigate the two-dimensional(2D) square-lattice single-band Hubbard model and obtain the self-energy with a finite imaginary part due to scattering. We calculate the density dependence of the Hall number $n_H=1/(qR_H)$. For small hole (or electron) doping $p$ (or $x$), our numerical results show that $n_H$ transitions from $p$ to $1+p$ for hole-doped systems, and from $-x$ to $1-x$ for electron-doped systems -- both in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between phase boundaries and the observed peculiar changes in the Hall number.</p>

This model can account for the ground state, excitations, the numerous field-induced fractional magnetization plateau phases and incommensurate magnetic correlations at elevated temperatures. Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ constitutes a rare example where rich magnetic phenomena can be understood and simulated quantitatively in terms of a simple classical Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols. Finally, we develop a general machine learning framework to optimize the adaptive resetting protocol for an arbitrary task beyond the current state of the art. We use it to discover efficient protocols for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$ under high pressure,with an onset critical temperature around 80 K, has sparked significant interest in the superconducting phases of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, Lan+1NinO3n+1. While La4Ni3O10 exhibits nearly 100% superconductivity with Tc~30 K under high pressure, magnetic susceptibility studies on La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, however, reveal a more complex picture, indicating either filamentary superconductivity or that approximately 50% of crystal phase becomes superconducting in polycrystalline samples. In this study, we employed scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy to visualize nanoscale structural phase separation in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, identifying enhanced optical conductivity with stripes approximately 183 nm wide. These stripes run diagonally with respect to the Ni-O-Ni bond directions in the a-b plane, ruling out the possibility that they arise from impurity phases, like the '1313', '214' or '4310' structures. The dark regions and bright stripes exhibit optical conductivities ~ 22% and 29% of gold's, respectively. Additionally, we find that the bright stripes constitute about 38% of the total field of view, while the remainder consists of dark regions and the transitional region between dark regions and bright stripes. Our results suggest that optical conductivity stripes originate from nanoscale structural phase separation. In contrast, La4Ni3O10 exhibits uniform and higher optical conductivity with no observable evidence of phase separation. Thus, our study represents a pioneering effort to directly image nanoscale phase separation in Lan+1NinO3n+1 nickelates. This observation could provide crucial insights into the factors that limit the superconducting volume fraction of La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, highlighting SNOM as a powerful probe for exploring nanoscale low-energy physics in correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the different transport mechanisms that can occur in pn junction devices made using atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) at temperatures ranging from cryogenic to room temperature. We first elucidate the potential cause of the anomalous behavior observed in the forward-bias response of these devices in recent cryogenic temperature measurements, which deviates from the theoretical response of a silicon Esaki diode. These anomalous behaviors include current suppression at low voltages in the forward-bias response and a much lower valley voltage at cryogenic temperatures than theoretically expected for a silicon diode. To investigate the potential causes of these anomalies, we studied the effects of a few possible transport mechanisms, including band-to-band tunneling, band gap narrowing, potential impact of non-Ohmic contacts, band quantization, impact of leakage, and inelastic trap-assisted tunneling, through semi-classical simulations. We find that a combination of two sets of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) parameters can qualitatively approximate the shape of the tunneling current at low bias. This can arise from band quantization and realignment due to the strong potential confinement in $\delta$-layers. We also find that the lower-than-theoretically-expected valley voltage can be attributed to modifications in the electronic band structure within the $\delta$-layer regions, leading to a significant band-gap narrowing induced by the high density of dopants. Finally, we extend our analyses to room temperature operation and predict that trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) facilitated by phonon interactions may become significant, leading to a complex superposition of BTBT and TAT transport mechanisms in the electrical measurements.</p>

            <p>Kitaev quantum spin liquids (KSLs) in layered honeycomb magnets are known to host Majorana quasiparticles, whose excitations depend strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In the high-field phase of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, specific heat measurements have revealed characteristic field-angle dependence of low-energy excitations consistent with the Kitaev model, providing bulk evidence for the KSL state. Here we present low-temperature measurements of specific heat $C(T)$ for another KSL candidate $\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{Co}_2\textrm{Te}\textrm{O}_6$ (NCTO) under field rotation within the honeycomb plane. Above the critical field of antiferromagnetic order, the field-angle dependence of $C/T$ exhibits minima along the bond directions, contrasting with the maxima observed in the KSL state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our analysis indicates nodeless, fully-gapped excitations, which are inconsistent with the angle-dependent Majorana excitations with gapless nodes predicted by the Kitaev model. These findings suggest that low-energy excitations in NCTO are governed by gapped magnon excitations rather than Majorana quasiparticles, providing thermodynamic evidence against a KSL state.</p>

            <h2>Effects of gravity on supersolid order in bubble-trapped bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Ciardi, Fabio Cinti, Giuseppe Pellicane, Santi Prestipino</p>
            <p>Unveiling the principles behind self-organization in quantum systems is of paramount importance, both intrinsically and practically, in view of foreseeable technological applications. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to atomic systems in curved geometries, which are a promising platform for the discovery of new emergent phenomena. A notable example is that of a gas of ultracold atoms loaded into a thin spherical shell, according to a protocol introduced by Zobay and Garraway more than twenty years ago. However, gravity prevents a dilute assembly of atoms from uniformly spreading throughout the shell, which explains why experiments on the condensation and superfluidity of bubble-trapped gases are usually conducted in space under microgravity conditions. In this paper, we focus instead on strongly-interacting quantum particles in a bubble trap, choosing the cluster supersolid of soft-core bosons as testbed. To study the impact of gravity on supersolid order, we consider a gedanken experiment in which the strength of gravity relative to the core repulsion is gradually enhanced. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we trace the parallel evolution of system structure and superfluidity at low temperature, finding that the latter is sizeable only when gravity is a small perturbation or, at the other extreme, so strong that particles are all gathered in one cluster at the bottom of the trap. Finally, we assess the relevance of gravity for the equilibrium behavior of ultracold Rydberg-dressed atoms in a bubble trap, concluding that in some cases clues of the supersolid phase in the absence of gravity could be found even in a laboratory on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Structure factor and topological bound of twisted bilayer semiconductors at fractional fillings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Zaklama, Di Luo, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>The structure factor is a useful observable for probing charge density correlations in real materials, and its long-wavelength behavior encapsulated by ``quantum weight'' has recently gained prominence in the study of quantum geometry and topological phases of matter. Here we employ the static structure factor, S(q), to explore the phase diagram of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically tMoTe2, at filling factors n=1/3, 2/3 under varying displacement fields. Our results reveal a topological phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a generalized Wigner crystal (GWC). This transition is marked by the appearance of Bragg peaks at charge-density-wave vectors, and simultaneously, large decrease of S(q) at small q which lowers the interaction energy. We further calculate the quantum weight of various FCI states, verifying the universal topological bound. Our findings provide new insights into the phase diagram of twisted TMDs and establish a general framework for characterizing topological phases through structure factor analysis.</p>

            <h2>Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyoshi Nakano, Kazuma Yokota</p>
            <p>In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.</p>

The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shouvik Sur, Chandan Setty</p>
            <p>Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</p>

            <h2>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen T. Fuller, J.-X. Kent Zheng</p>
            <p>The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boburjon Mukhamedov, Ferenc Tasnadi, Igor A. Abrikosov</p>
            <p>Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rand A. Al-Waqfi, Cengiz Khan, Oliver J. Irving, Lauren Matthews, Tim Albrecht</p>
            <p>Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sepide Mohamadi, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</p>

We explore its technical aspects, including convergence and the quality of approximations used. We successfully apply this method to investigate self-trapped excitons in LiF. The excited state forces method provides valuable insights into ionic dynamics in the excited state and the microscopic mechanism of exciton self-trapping.</p>

            <p>The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai-Kang Zhang, Yuanji Xu, Guojun Li, Junshuai Wang, Zhongpo Zhou, Yipeng An</p>
            <p>Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct structural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy rare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition under high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as temperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is closely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we systematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with temperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the energy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the experimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the electronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using DFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of Ce-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of Ce-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and CeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure of the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally observed structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in experiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the mixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our results suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the structural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize and CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may cause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase transition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of CeCoSi under high pressure.</p>

            <h2>Tunable electron-electron interaction and anomalous enhancement of large-momentum scattering in moir√© superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka</p>
            <p>Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moir√© graphene.</p>

            <p>This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>A direct summation method for the Madelung constant calculation is presented where a crystal lattice is constructed from linear arrays of charges or axial multipoles. An array is designed to have vanishing low order electric moments such that its potential at the origin from a distance $r$ decays at least as fast as $r^{-5}$, but preferably as fast as $r^{-13}$. High potential decay rates render the summation absolutely convergent in up to 6 dimensions. Convergence speed increases with higher decay rates. It is also shown that the limit approached by the summation is independent of the growth geometry. Madelung constants for NaCl bulk, surface, and edge lattice points are calculated, as well as on off-lattice points such as interstitial positions and external neighborhoods of surfaces. In addition, bulk CsCl Madelung constant was calculated. In 1D, 2D, and 3D, accuracy of 13 decimal places are attained within 40 nearest neighbor distance from the reference ion.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto Menta, Pablo G. Debenedetti, Roberto Car, Pablo M. Piaggi</p>
            <p>Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</p>

            <p>The spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking (RSB), a hallmark phenomenon in cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors, is believed to intimately connected to superconductivity, both of which originate from interactions among different degrees of freedoms and competing quantum states. Understanding RSB is pivotal for unraveling the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity. Although infinite-layer nickelates (ILNs) share similar crystalline structure and the same nominal 3d-electron configurations with cuprates, they have significant differences in Fermi surface topology, electronic band characteristics, and charge order. These distinctions make ILNs an ideal platform for studying RSB in unconventional superconductors. Through angular-resolved resistivity measurements within a large temperature and doping range, we identify pronounced RSB signatures near doping concentrations x=0.05 and 0.25. Based on the strongly correlated electronic structures from combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we find that the calculated electronic susceptibility has a peak structure at the corresponding doping concentration, indicating pronounced electronic instabilities which drive RSB. Detailed analysis of the electronic susceptibility demonstrates that the van Hove singularity at the Fermi level significantly contributes to the electronic instability at 0.05 Sr doping. Our findings reveal the important role of electronic correlation, Van Hove singularity, and Fermi surface nesting in the emergence of RSB. Our work not only deepens the understanding of electronic behavior in ILNs, but also provides new ideas and methods for exploring RSB in other unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.</p>

            <p>We use a two-coil mutual inductance technique to investigate the non-linear response of the vortex lattice of two type-II superconducting thin films, namely a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe) and a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN). We observe a strong dependence of the magnetic shielding response of the superconductors on the ac excitation amplitude in the primary coil of the two-coil setup. The sample response is studied through the evolution of the radial profile of the induced current density with increasing drive amplitude, which gets significantly modified by the effect of flux creep. We develop a computation scheme where we iteratively combine the coupled Maxwell-London equations for the geometry of the two coils and the sample involved, with a model developed by Coffey and Clem, to analyze the non-linear ac response. The central result of this analysis is that the effect of flux creep gives rise to a strong nonlinearity in the electrodynamic response in the vortex state of the superconducting thin films, that extends down to very low amplitudes of ac excitation. Our results also show that at subcritical low frequency ac drives, the vortex viscosity is exponentially larger than the Bardeen-Stephen estimate. We present a simple scheme to obtain the intrinsic value of the pinning force constant, which otherwise gets affected due to flux creep even at very low ac drives and point out some outstanding issues that need to be addressed in future theoretical and experimental studies.</p>

However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of ab initio methods to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Here, we resolve this challenge by developing an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Based on this theory, we demonstrate EPC-induced giant phonon magnetic moments and resulting phonon Zeeman splittings in magnetic metals, which are orders of magnitude larger than classical predictions from point-charge models. Interestingly, these splittings could open observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we first propose candidate materials with such intrinsic phonon Chern states hosting robust edge phonon currents which may be applied to detecting neutral particles such as dark matter particles. Our work not only establishes a theoretical foundation for EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, but also enables the ab initio calculation of long-sought TRS-breaking phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone in realistic materials.</p>

            <h2>Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuan Liu, Wen Wei Ho</p>
            <p>We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</p>

            <h2>Hilbert Space Fragmentation and Subspace Scar Time-Crystallinity in Driven Homogeneous Central-Spin Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Kumar, Rafail Frantzeskakis, Edwin Barnes</p>
            <p>We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.</p>

            <h2>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</h2>

            <p>Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</p>

            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</p>

            <h2>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via nonlocal visual interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Susumu Ito, Nariya Uchida</p>
            <p>Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>Nanoporous carbon materials containing small domains of sp2-carbon with highly disordered structures are promising for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, carbon nanofoam and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under different background gases (Ar, N2, N2-H2), and employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon electrode shows a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved compared to not-functionalized counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).</p>

            <p>We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</p>

Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</p>

            <p>Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</p>

            <h2>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Kikuchi</p>
            <p>Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</p>

The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability compared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered around 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors, with a frequency tunability of 10 MHz achieved using a varactor diode. Furthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the commercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a measured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.</p>

            <p>Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu</p>
            <p>By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</p>

            <p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p>

We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.</p>

As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</p>

            <h2>Quantum teleportation between simulated binary black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiden Daniel, Tanmay Bhore, Jiannis K. Pachos, Chang Liu, Andrew Hallam</p>
            <p>The quantum description of a black hole predicts that quantum information hidden behind the event horizon can be teleported outside almost instantaneously. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral spin-chain model, which naturally simulates a binary black hole system, can realise this teleportation process. Our system captures two essential components of this protocol: Hawking radiation, which generates the necessary entanglement between the black holes, and optimal scrambling, which enables high-fidelity teleportation on short timescales. Through numerical simulations, we quantify the key timescales governing the process, including the Page time, radiation time, scrambling time, and butterfly velocity, showing their universal dependence on the chiral coupling strength. Our results establish the feasibility of simulating quantum properties of black holes within condensed matter systems, offering an experimentally accessible platform for probing otherwise inaccessible high-energy phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Finding Hidden Numbers with Majorana-based Topological Quantum Algorithms: Simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasmin Bedow, Dirk K. Morr</p>
            <p>Executing quantum algorithms using Majorana zero modes - a major milestone for the field of topological quantum computing - requires a platform that can be scaled to large quantum registers, can be controlled in real time and space, and a braiding protocol that uses the unique properties of these exotic particles. Here, we demonstrate the first successful simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures from initialization to read-out of the final many-body state. Utilizing the Majorana zero modes' topological properties, we introduce an optimized braiding protocol for the algorithm and a scalable architecture for its implementation with an arbitrary number of qubits. We visualize the algorithm protocol in real time and space by computing the non-equilibrium density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance, and the non-equilibrium charge density, which assigns a unique signature to each final state of the algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Coherence of a hole spin flopping-mode qubit in a circuit quantum electrodynamics environment</h2>

            <p>The entanglement of microwave photons and spin qubits in silicon represents a pivotal step forward for quantum information processing utilizing semiconductor quantum dots. Such hybrid spin circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been achieved by granting a substantial electric dipole moment to a spin by de-localizing it in a double quantum dot under spin-orbit interaction, thereby forming a flopping-mode (FM) spin qubit. Despite its promise, the coherence properties demonstrated to date remain insufficient to envision FM spin qubits as practical single qubits. Here, we present a FM hole spin qubit in a silicon nanowire coupled to a high-impedance niobium nitride microwave resonator for readout. We report Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and coherence times in the microsecond range, resulting in a high single gate quality factor of 380. This establishes FM spin qubits as fast and reliable qubits. Moreover, using the large frequency tunability of the FM qubit, we reveal for the first time that photonic effects predominantly limit coherence, with radiative decay being the main relaxation channel and photon shot-noise inducing dephasing. These results highlight that optimized microwave engineering can unlock the potential of FM spin qubits in hybrid cQED architectures, offering a scalable and robust platform for fast and coherent spin qubits with strong coupling to microwave photons.</p>

            <h2>Atomic Altermagnetism</h2>

            <p>Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a N√©el vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear N√©el antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42¬∞ and 26¬∞ respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered N√©el order of local dipole moments.</p>

            <p>Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Magnetic Janus Particle Assembly with Differential Evolution Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric A. McPherson, Kenneth Kroenlein, Ilona Kretzschmar</p>
            <p>Magnetic Janus particles allow access to complex, nonlinear assembled structures that may enable interesting new magnetorheological (MR) fluids with uniquely engineered field responses. However, the overwhelming size of the parameter space for Janus and patchy particles makes exploration of such systems by experimental trial and error or through detailed simulation impractical. Here, a differential evolution (DE)-based simulation method is explored to predict the assembly of magnetic Janus particles as an alternative method for assembly prediction. Structure predictions from the DE simulation for laterally- and radially-shifted magnetic Janus particles are compared to four published experimental and simulation case studies. The DE simulation captures the orientation and structure of magnetic Janus particles for a range of shifts and a variety of external field conditions using the point dipole approximation. Structural predictions that rely on the reorganization of large clusters of particles were less well represented by the DE predictions. Despite this limitation, the DE simulation method can be used to predict key structural factors for magnetic Janus particle assemblies, as demonstrated by favorable comparison with three of the four model studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario Caserta, Tommaso Chiarotti, Marco Vanzini, Nicola Marzari</p>
            <p>Electronic correlations beyond static mean-field theories are of fundamental importance in describing the properties of complex materials - such as transition-metal oxides - where the low-energy physics is driven by localized d or f electrons. Here, we show that it is possible to capture these correlations with a local and dynamical self energy, extending to the spin-polarized and multi-site case our recently introduced dynamical Hubbard functional formulation. We apply this formalism to the prototypical transition-metal monoxide series of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in their ground state, finding excellent agreement with experiments for the spectral properties. The results are comparable or improved with respect to state-of-the-art theories, both for the densities of states and for the spectral functions - including band renormalization and spectral weight transfer - in a numerically efficient and physically transparent treatment of correlations amenable to the study of realistic, complex materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Geisler, James J. Hamlin, Gregory R. Stewart, Richard G. Hennig, P.J. Hirschfeld</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</p>

            <p>We perform a high-throughput computational search for novel phonon-mediated superconductors, starting from the Materials Cloud 3-dimensional structure database of experimentally known inorganic stoichiometric compounds. We first compute the Allen-Dynes critical temperature (T$_c$) for 4533 non-magnetic metals using a direct and progressively finer sampling of the electron-phonon couplings. For the candidates with the largest T$_c$, we use automated Wannierizations and electron-phonon interpolations to obtain a high-quality dataset for the most promising 240 dynamically stable structures, for which we calculate spectral functions, superconducting bandgaps, and isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg critical temperatures. For 110 of these, we also provide anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting gaps and critical temperatures. The approach is remarkably successful in finding known superconductors, and we find 24 unknown ones with a predicted anisotropic Tc above 10 K. Among them, we identify a possible double gap superconductor (p-doped BaB$_2$), a non-magnetic half-Heusler ZrRuSb, and the perovskite TaRu$_3$C, all exhibiting significant T$_c$. Finally, we introduce a sensitivity analysis to estimate the robustness of the predictions.</p>

            <p>Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional splitting of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.</p>

            <p>The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect has recently been experimentally observed in zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCI). However, an outstanding challenge is the presence of a substantial longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ (a few k$\Omega$), even though the anomalous Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ is quantized. This dissipative behavior is likely linked to imperfect sample quality. Here, we report transport measurements of a drastically improved twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ bilayer device, which exhibits quantized $R_{xy}$ and vanishing $R_{xx}$ for the $-2/3$ state, marking a dissipationless FCI. Contrary to fractional quantum Hall states where the energy gap increases with magnetic field, we find that the thermal activation gap of the observed FCI states decreases rapidly as the magnetic field rises from zero, then plateaus above a few teslas. This observation is attributed to the interplay between spin and charge gaps. Due to the spontaneous ferromagnetism, the spin gap dominates at low field, while the charge gap becomes appreciable once the magnetic field freezes spin fluctuations. For the $-2/3$ state, we estimate the spin and FCI gap of about 55 and 20 K, respectively. Our results provide insights into the energy scale of FCI and offer a pathway for quantum engineering of exotic correlated topological states.</p>

            <h2>A pseudo-dynamic phase-field model for brittle fracture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Michael Sargado, Joachim Mathiesen</p>
            <p>The enforcement of global energy conservation in phase-field fracture simulations has been an open problem for the last 25 years. Specifically, the occurrence of unstable fracture is accompanied by a loss in total potential energy, which suggests a violation of the energy conservation law. This phenomenon can occur even with purely quasi-static, displacement-driven loading conditions, where finite crack growth arises from an infinitesimal increase in load. While such behavior is typically seen in crack nucleation, it may also occur in other situations. Initial efforts to enforce energy conservation involved backtracking schemes based on global minimization, however in recent years it has become clearer that unstable fracture, being an inherently dynamic phenomenon, cannot be adequately resolved within a purely quasi-static framework. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether transitioning to a fully dynamic framework would sufficiently address the issue. In this work, we propose a pseudo-dynamic framework designed to enforce energy balance without relying on global minimization. This approach incorporates dynamic effects heuristically into an otherwise quasi-static model, allowing us to bypass solving the full dynamic linear momentum equation. It offers the flexibility to simulate crack evolution along a spectrum, ranging from full energy conservation at one extreme to maximal energy loss at the other. Using data from recent experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can closely replicate experimental load-displacement curves, achieving results that are unattainable with classical phase-field models.</p>

To this end, we investigate non-equilibrium steady states in a classical Heisenberg model with frustrated exchange interactions on a two-dimensional triangular lattice by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation at zero temperature. Our results reveal that the linearly polarized AC electric-field irradiation induces a topological phase transition from a single-Q spiral state to a bimeron crystal with the skyrmion number of one in the low-frequency regime. Furthermore, we show that the obtained bimeron crystal remains relatively stable against both easy-axis and easy-plane single-ion anisotropies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatia Kiliptari, Dmitrii L. Maslov</p>
            <p>The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a classic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp scattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur. In this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such as dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected Fermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a two-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first non-zero contribution scales as $T^4\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this paper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from electron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the $T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal magnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\ln T$, respectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling, i.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered for a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum, magnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when electron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that all components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values that are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the corresponding values at $T=0$.</p>

We summarize the requirements and suggest some illustrative design structures.</p>

The Hall resistivity measured with rotating the magnetic field within the (001) principal plane of EuZn2Sb2 films exhibits a clear three-fold component corresponding to the in-plane anomalous Hall effect, which is distinct from the two-fold component of the planar Hall effect. The in-plane anomalous Hall effect of EuZn2Sb2 is highly contrasting to EuCd2Sb2, especially in terms of its opposite sign and field dependence, which can be explained by model calculations with different band inversion parameters. Our results pave the way for systematically controlling the in-plane anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization through elaborate band engineering.</p>

            <p>The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline. This study investigates the humidity-induced failure mechanisms in crystalline silicon solar cells. Using density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we systematically examine the microscopic diffusion mechanisms of hydrogen and oxygen defects and their impact on photovoltaic performance. Hydrogen and oxygen are interstitial defects that can introduce both deep-level and resonant-state recombination centers, thereby reducing carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency. Furthermore, hydrogen exhibits prominent diffusion pathways, particularly in its +1 and 0 charge states at the BC site ( "H" _"i(BC)" ^"+1" and "H" _"i(BC)" ^"0" ), while oxygen in its +1 and 0 charge states shows a higher diffusion barrier at the BC1 site ( "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"+1" and "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"0" ). These defects, induced by moisture and temperature fluctuations, exacerbate the degradation of solar cell performance. By analyzing these defect behaviors, this research provides valuable insights into the failure mechanisms of Si solar cells, especially under humid conditions.</p>

            <p>Bubble formation in electrochemical system often hinders reaction efficiency by reducing active surface area and obstructing mass transfer, yet the mechanisms governing their nanoscale nucleation dynamics and impact remains unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore nanobubble nucleation and reaction rates during water electrolysis on planar- and nano-electrodes, with systematically tuning electrode wettability through water-electrode and gas-electrode interactions. We identified distinct nucleation regimes: gas layers, surface nanobubbles, bulk nanobubbles, and no nanobubbles, and revealed a volcano-shaped relationship between wettability and reaction rate, where optimal wettability strikes a balance between suppressing bubbles and ensuring sufficient reactant availability to maximize performance. Nanoelectrodes consistently exhibit higher current densities compared to planar electrodes with the same wettability, due to pronounced edge effects. Furthermore, moderate driving forces enhance reaction rates without triggering surface bubble formation, while excessive driving forces induce surface nanobubble nucleation, leading to suppressed reaction rates and complex dynamics driven by bubble growth and detachment. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning wettability and reaction driving forces to optimize gas-evolving electrochemical systems at the nanoscale and underscore the need for multiscale simulation frameworks integrating atomic-scale reaction kinetics, nanoscale bubble nucleation, and microscale bubble dynamics to fully understand bubble behavior and its impact on performance.</p>

One such example is the formation of spin cycloid structures within multiferroic materials, which we investigate in this work by focusing on their magnon excitations and transport based on a general multiferroic Hamiltonian with an antiferromagnetic order. More specifically, we identify the ground state and explore the dynamics of magnon modes, revealing distinct in-plane and out-of-plane modes with anisotropic dispersion this http URL magnon modes include a massless excitation, known as the Goldstone boson, originating from the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry by the formation of the cycloid structures. By employing the Boltzmann transport formalism, the magnonic thermal conductivity with spin cycloids and low-temperature anisotropic behaviors is discussed. This work provides pathways to envision the spin-textured multiferroics, which may serve as a fertile ground to look for novel thermal and spin transport with the rich interplay of quasiparticles such as magnons and phonons.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the cRPA: A Comparative Analysis of Methods for Calculating Hubbard Parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, M. Kaltak, Bongjae Kim</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter U. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO2 (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Yukitake, Daisuke Hara, Shuichi Murakami</p>
            <p>Recently, some $Z_2$ monopole charges were defined for Dirac semimetals with $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal) in previous works, and the charges are believed to lead to double-helicoid surface states. However, no proof of the bulk-surface correspondence is given there. In this paper, we point out one of the $Z_2$ charges in the previous works is gauge-dependent, and newly define another $Z_2$ charge. Using this new $Z_2$ charge, we give a proof of the bulk-surface correspondence. We also compare the new $Z_2$ charge with the $Z_2$ invariant for $\mathcal{G}$-protected topological crystalline insulators, and the second Stiefel-Whitney number for $\mathcal{PT}$-protected nodal line semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J.-H. Lee, Bongjae Kim</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</p>

            <p>Efficient magnetic switching is a cornerstone for advancing spintronics, particularly for energy-efficient data storage and memory devices. Here, we report the electrical switching of spin-flips in V-doped WSe2 multilayers, a van der Waals (vdW)-layered diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), demonstrating ultralow-power switching operation at room temperature. Our study reveals unique linear magnetoresistance and parabolic magnetoresistance states, where electrical modulation induces transitions between interlayered ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic configurations. We identify an unconventional linear magnetoresistance hysteresis characterized by electrically driven spin flip/flop switching, distinct from conventional random network disorder or linear band-dispersion mechanisms. Applying an electrical voltage across vertical vdW layered V-doped WSe2 multilayers generates the spin currents at room temperature, driving spin-flip transitions from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic states due to a strong spin transfer torque effect. Notably, the critical current density reaches an ultralow value of 10-1Acm-2, accompanied by pico-watt power consumption, a record-low spin current density by a six-order-of-magnitude improvement over conventional spintronic devices. These findings establish the V-doped WSe2 multilayer device as a transformative platform for ultralow power spintronics, underscoring the potential of vdW-layered DMS systems for next generation energy-efficient spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the efficient excitation of spin waves in the ultra-low magnetic damping material yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). To this end, we employ interdigital transducers fabricated on a piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film covering the YIG. This enables the excitation of coherent, propagating Rayleigh-type and Sezawa-type SAWs. We find that the ultralow magnetic damping of YIG is retained after the ZnO-deposition and we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the magnetoelastic interaction due to the different SAW modes as a function of the external magnetic field magnitude and orientation. By measuring the SAW attenuation our experiments reveal a highly anisotropic and non-reciprocal SAW-SW-interaction in agreement with our model caluclation, while demonstrating that low-damping magnons can be efficiently excited by SAWs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malte Schubert, Koushik Mukherjee, Tilman Pfau, Stephanie Reimann</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</p>

A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to \neelfm\ phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of $c$-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the \neelfm\ phase is a rare example of {\it intrinsic} altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. The existence of this phase may resulting in nontrivial effect on the re-emerging superconducting phase of \kfsxy\ under high pressure.</p>

            <h2>On the origin of bulk-related anisotropies in surface optical spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Gro√ümann, Kai Daniel Hanke, Chris Yannic Bohlemann, Agnieszka Paszuk, Thomas Hannappel, Wolf Gero Schmidt, Erich Runge</p>
            <p>Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) is a powerful method for probing the optical properties of surfaces, used routinely in research and industrial applications, yet the origin of 'bulk-related' features that appear in the spectra of various surfaces has been debated for nearly 40 years. It is often argued that these features are related to surface-induced bulk anisotropy (SIBA) because they coincide with critical energies of the bulk dielectric function. In general, any quantitative RAS theory must include excitonic effects as they significantly influence the spectra and are believed to be the key to determining the origin of SIBA features. Here, we introduce a layer-resolved exciton localization (LREL) measure within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which enables a quantitative analysis of the origins of 'bulk-related' RAS features. Applying LREL to arsenic-modified silicon reconstructions reveals that, depending on the surface reconstruction, the 'apparent' SIBA features arise primarily from states localized at the surface, with only a small contribution from the underlying layers. Our findings, further supported by the fact that the calculated spectra agree well with low-temperature RAS measurements, challenge the conventional explanation of 'bulk-related' RAS features. They indicate that in many instances bulk-enhanced surface anisotropies (BESA)-the opposite of SIBA-contribute to, or are even responsible for, 'bulk-related' RAS features. Therefore, we suggest that previously studied semiconductor surfaces, which exhibit 'bulk-related' features in their spectra, should be reanalyzed using the presented method.</p>

            <p>Climate emergency has led to the investigation of CO$_{2}$ valorization routes. A competitive process included in this framework is the catalytic CO$_{2}$ cycloaddition to epoxides, to produce cyclic carbonates. Halide-based Ionic liquids (ILs) have been postulated to be a competitive choice. Nevertheless, the structure-performance relation for different ILs is still a topic of debate, being the cation-anion dissociation constant a key descriptor. In this work, the ions effect is tackled by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Propylene oxide and carbonate force fields were tested and used for 1,2-epoxyhexane and hexylene carbonate force field construction, while ILs were modelled by the CL\&P force field. Solubilities in an epoxide-carbonate medium were tested for ILs composed of [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] or [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cations combined with the halide anions: Iodide [$\mathrm{I^-}$], Bromide [$\mathrm{Br^-}$] and Chloride [$\mathrm{Cl^-}$]. Results showed that [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids were insoluble in the epoxide/carbonate medium, whereas [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids demonstrated diffusion. Reaction medium interactions were studied between key atoms for experimentally soluble ILs. It was found that cation-anion interaction follows the catalytic activity trend, being [$\mathrm{I^-}$] the halide anion less associated with ([$\mathrm{N4444^+}$], [$\mathrm{bmim^+}$] and [$\mathrm{emim^+}$]) cations. A correlation between the first peak integration of the radial distribution functions and the experimental yields (including [$\mathrm{N1111^+}$][$\mathrm{Br^-}$]) could be established with a regression coefficient of 0.86. Additionally, [$\mathrm{I^-}$] based ILs displayed a better interaction between the cation and the epoxide oxygen, phenomena linked to epoxide activation and intermediates stabilization.</p>

            <p>An out of equilibrium two-dimensional superfluid relaxes towards equilibrium via a process of coarsening, driven by the annihilation of vortices with antivortices. Here we present a comparison of two different numerical models of this process, a dissipative point vortex model and Fokker-Planck evolution, across a wide range of initial configurations and levels of dissipation. We find that our dissipative point vortex model is well-approximated by Fokker-Planck evolution only for very low initial energies per vortex, approximately less than -4, when almost all vortices and antivortices are closely bound into dipoles. We observe that the dynamical critical exponent, $z$, in the dissipative point vortex model, undergoes a crossover, from a roughly constant value close to two for energy per vortex approximately greater than -4 to one which depends explicitly on the initial conditions for energy per vortex approximately less than -5.</p>

            <p>Infinite layer nickelates have garnered significant attention due to their potential for high-temperature superconductivity. Despite extensive research, the interplay between oxygen stoichiometry and electronic properties in infinite layer nickelates remains inadequately understood. In this study, we employ advanced electron microscopy techniques and theoretical modeling to directly visualize the distribution of residual oxygen within an 8NdNiO$_2$/2SrTiO$_3$ superlattice, providing novel insights into its structural and electronic effects. Our multislice ptychography analysis reveals a disordered arrangement of apical oxygen atoms, even in regions with low residual oxygen occupancy, invisible in conventional projected images but discernible in depth-resolved phase contrast images. This disordered distribution suggests the formation of local domains with varying degrees of oxygenation, leading to significant structural distortions. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals inhomogeneous hole doping, which may influence the occurrence of superconductivity. Complementary density functional theory calculations show how residual oxygen and associated structural distortions, such as pyramidal and octahedral configurations, alter the electronic structure. Although superconductivity was not observed in the studied superlattice, our findings highlight the critical influence of residual oxygen in shaping electronic phases and suggest that precise control of oxygen stoichiometry is essential in infinite layer nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Travƒõnec, Ladislav ≈†amaj</p>
            <p>A limited number of 2D and 3D materials under a constant pressure contract in volume upon heating isobarically; this anomalous phenomenon is known as the negative thermal expansion (NTE). In this paper, the NTE anomaly is observed in 1D fluids of classical particles interacting pairwisely with two competing length scales: the hard-core diameter $a$ and the finite range $a'>a$ of a soft repulsive potential component. If $a'\le 2a$, the pair interactions reduce themselves to nearest neighbours which permits a closed-form solution of thermodynamics in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble characterized by temperature $T$ and pressure $p$. We focus on the equation of state (EoS) which relates the average distance between particles (reciprocal density) $l$ to $T$ and $p\ge 0$. The EoS is expressible explicitly in terms of elementary or special functions for specific, already known and new, cases like the square shoulder, the linear and quadratic ramps as well as certain types of logarithmic interaction potentials. The emphasis is put on low-$T$ anomalies of the EoS. Firstly, the equidistant ground state as the function of the pressure can exhibit, at some ``compressibility'' pressures, a jump in chain spacing from $a'$ to $a$. Secondly, the analytical structure of the low-$T$ expansion of $l(T,p)$ depends on ranges of $p$-values. Thirdly, the presence of the NTE anomaly depends very much on the shape of the core-softened potential.</p>

In contrast, the microscopics of anomalous single-particle excitations underlying non-Fermi liquid properties have largely remained in the dark. Here we spectroscopically map such quantum-critical excitations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under uniaxial pressure, an experimental challenge overcome by technical advances combining focused ion beam micro-milling with laser angle resolved photoemission. We show that quasiparticle excitations acquire a non-Fermi liquid scattering rate near the critical point but remain remarkably robust throughout the transition. These experiments serve as a benchmark for the theory of anomalous metals and settle the long-standing question if quantum-critical systems host quasiparticle excitations.</p>

            <p>Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara J. Lapp, Julia M. Link, Carsten Timm</p>
            <p>Nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors can host zero-energy flat bands of Majorana surface states within the projection of the nodal lines onto the surface Brillouin zone. Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.</p>

            <p>Control of magnetism through voltage-driven ionic processes (i.e., magneto-ionics) holds potential for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility, flexibility in adjusting the magnitude and speed of magnetic modulation, and energy efficiency. Since magneto-ionics depends on factors like ionic radius and electronegativity, identifying alternative mobile ions is crucial to embrace new phenomena and applications. Here, the feasibility of C as a prospective magneto-ionic ion is investigated in a Fe-C system by electrolyte gating. In contrast to most magneto-ionic systems, Fe-C presents a dual-ion mechanism: Fe and C act as cation and anion, respectively, moving uniformly in opposite directions under an applied electric field. This leads to a 7-fold increase in saturation magnetization with magneto-ionic rates larger than 1 emu cm-3 s-1, and a 25-fold increase in coercivity. Since carbides exhibit minimal cytotoxicity, this introduces a biocompatible dimension to magneto-ionics, paving the way for the convergence of spintronics and biotechnology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel B. Walker, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.</p>

            <p>The heavy fermion metamagnet uranium ditelluride possesses two distinct magnetic field--induced superconducting states. One of these superconductive phases resides at magnetic fields immediately below a first-order metamagnetic transition to a field--polarized paramagnetic state at a field strength $H_m$, while the other exists predominantly above $H_m$. However, little is known about the microscopic properties of this polarized paramagnetic state. Here we report pulsed magnetic field measurements tracking the evolution of $H_m$ for polar and azimuthal inclinations in the vicinity of the crystallographic $b-a$ plane. We uncover a region of the phase diagram at high fields $>$ 50 T with a ripple-like non-monotonic dependence of $H_m$ on the orientation of field. Within this ripple in the metamagnetic transition surface, $H_m$ exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence. Our results point towards the presence of complex magnetic interactions and possible magnetic sub-phases at high magnetic fields in UTe$_2$, which may have important implications for the manifestation of exotic field-induced superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks require a host material whose band gap is larger than the 8.4 eV nuclear transition energy. As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\sigma = 4.6\times10^{-23}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where ${\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized. This is roughly six orders of magnitude lower than previously thought possible.</p>

            <h2>The stress tensor of dilute active colloidal suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Gaspard</p>
            <p>The stress tensor is calculated for dilute active suspensions composed of colloidal Janus particles propelled by self-diffusiophoresis and powered by a chemical reaction. The Janus particles are assumed to be spherical and made of catalytic and non-catalytic hemispheres. The chemical reaction taking place on the catalytic part of each Janus particle generates local molecular concentration gradients at the surface of the particle and, thus, an interfacial velocity slippage between the fluid and the solid particle, which is the propulsion mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis. In the dilute-system limit, the contributions of the suspended particles to the stress tensor are calculated by solving the chemohydrodynamic equations for the fluid velocity and the molecular concentrations around every Janus particle considered as isolated and far apart from each other. The results are the following. First, the well-known Einstein formula for the effective shear viscosity of colloidal suspensions is recovered, including the effect of a possible Navier slip length. Next, two further contributions are obtained, which depend on the molecular concentrations of the fuel and product species of the chemical reaction and on the orientation of the Janus particles. The second contribution is caused by simple diffusiophoresis, which already exists in passive suspensions with global concentration gradients and no reaction. The third contribution is due to the self-diffusiophoresis generated by the chemical reaction, which arises in active suspensions. The calculation gives quantitative predictions, which depend on the constitutive properties of the fluid and the fluid-solid interfaces, as well as on the geometry of the Janus particles.</p>

            <h2>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma</p>
            <p>Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.</p>

            <p>Voltage control of magnetism via magneto-ionics, where ion transport and/or redox processes drive magnetic modulation, holds great promise for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility and ability to precisely tune both the magnitude and speed of magnetic properties in an energy-efficient manner. However, expanding magneto-ionics to incorporate novel mobile ions or even multiple ion species is crucial for unlocking new phenomena and enabling multifunctional capabilities. Here, we demonstrate voltage-driven multi-ion transport in a FeBO system with increasing oxygen content, progressively transitioning from an electrostatic-like response to a more pronounced electrochemical (magneto-ionic) behavior. The voltage-driven transport of both B and Fe is activated by oxidation state tuning, owing to the larger electronegativity of oxygen. Such charge-transfer effects allow multi-ion magneto-ionics, where O ions move oppositely to Fe and B ions. These results pave the way for programmable functionalities by leveraging elements with different electron affinities through charge-transfer engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niels T. Pronk, Bowy M. La Rivi√®re, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>We report a phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor Heisenberg and three-site interactions in the presence of single-ion anisotropy. We show that the Gaussian and Ising transitions that separate the topological Haldane phase from the two anisotropic phases eventually fuse into a higher symmetry point characterized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_2$ critical theory providing a lattice realization of the conformal embedding. On the other side of the WZW multi-critical point, the Ising transition reappears together with the distinct and exotic $c=1$ transition belonging to the eight-vertex universality class. This transition, which separates the dimerized and Ising antiferromagnetic phases - two ordered phases with incompatible order parameters - is thus a one-dimensional realization of a deconfined quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying ultra-fast electron dynamics and material properties, where the coherent character of the electron dynamics is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we expound a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs inter-band contributions to the total signal. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space of this coherent suppression of high harmonics in systems of massive Dirac Fermions. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case. Moreover, we demonstrate reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics upon increasing dephasing.</p>

            <p>Lead-halide perovskites exhibit remarkable efficiency in photovoltaics, driven by exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths and recombination times. Paradoxically, this performance persists even in defect-rich, solution-grown samples. Here, we use a suite of optical and charge transport measurements to reveal that key optoelectronic properties of perovskites arise from localized flexoelectric polarization confined to the interfaces between domains of spontaneous strain, present even in nominally cubic single crystals. This insight provides a microscopic link between structural composition and charge transport in these materials, reconciling conflicting prior observations and offering new design principles for perovskite-based solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Influence of tip materials on the friction force microscopy of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001): comparison of diamond and silicon tips in experiments and atomistic simulations</h2>

            <p>Friction force microscopy (FFM) with silicon tips on epitaxial graphene supported by SiC(0001) previously revealed a sharp increase in friction at a threshold normal force, linked to the intermittent rehybridization of graphene and the formation of single-layer diamond above 12 GPa. In this study, the FFM behavior of a diamond tip is compared with that of the silicon tip. The diamond tip exhibited a similar abrupt increase in friction, but the threshold normal force was approximately twice as high for comparable tip radii. Simulations of graphene on SiC(0001) sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a-C) and silicon oxide (SiO2) slabs show that both systems exhibit low shear stress at low pressures, which increases at higher pressures due to bond formation between the graphene and counter slabs. The pressure dependence differs slightly: SiO2 reaches a shear stress plateau around 6 GPa, while a-C continues to increase gradually. For a-C, the transition threshold shifts to higher pressures, consistent with FFM results. Temperature lowers the transition threshold significantly, while sliding velocity has minimal impact on shear stress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low-friction interfaces between epitaxial graphene and the key materials which come into contact with graphene in current micro-electro-mechanical systems.</p>

            <h2>Variational Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo Built on Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueyi Wang, Kristjan Haule</p>
            <p>We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the breakdown of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the N'{e}el transition, we accurately predict the N'{e}el temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and single-particle spectral functions, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.</p>

            <h2>Controllable Antiferromagnetic-Ferromagnetic phase transition in monolayer MnPSe3 via atomic adsorption of Li, O, and F</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Liu, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Yu-Jun Zhao</p>
            <p>The engineering of magnetic order and electronic states in two-dimensional (2D) materials is pivotal for advanced spintronic technologies. Despite their potential, the scarcity of intrinsic 2D ferromagnets remains a critical challenge. Here, we employ density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections to systematically investigate adsorbate-driven magnetic transitions in monolayer MnPSe3. While pristine MnPSe3 exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a semiconducting gap, Li, O, and F adatom adsorption induces an AFM-to-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) phase transition across large coverage ranges. Our calculations reveal enhanced thermodynamic stability at elevated coverages, with full-coverage configurations (Li0.5MnPSe3, MnPSe3O0.5, MnPSe3F0.5) favored energetically. Hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations show that F adsorption drives a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, whereas Li and O adsorption preserves semiconductivity. Moreover, Li adsorption induces a valley splitting of 20.3 meV at the K1 and K2 points in the band structure of the monolayer MnPSe3. Magnetic anisotropy analysis reveals adsorbate-dependent easy-axis reorientation: Li (electron doping) switches the easy-axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while O/F (hole doping) stabilizes in-plane easy-axis, consistent with carrier-density-modulation simulations. Crucially, carrier doping results indicate that once the electron doping concentration reaches critical concentration, the magnetic easy axis of monolayer MnPSe3 transitions from in-plane to out-of-plane. This work establishes atomic adsorption as a robust strategy for tailoring 2D magnetism, resolving discrepancies through rigorous treatment of exchange-correlation effects and configurational diversity.</p>

            <p>Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide new insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</p>

            <p>It is difficult to completely eliminate disorder during the fabrication of graphene-based nanodevices. From a simulation perspective, it is straightforward to determine the electronic transport properties of disordered devices if complete information about the disorder and the Hamiltonian describing it is available. However, to do the reverse and determine information about the nature of the disorder purely from transport measurements is a far more difficult task. In this work, we apply a recently developed inversion technique to identify important structural information about edge-disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons. The inversion tool decodes the electronic transmission spectrum to obtain the overall level of edge vacancies in this type of device. We also consider the role of spin-polarised states at the ribbon edges and demonstrate that, in addition to edge roughness, the inversion procedure can also be used to detect the presence of magnetism in such nanoribbons. We finally show that if the transmission for both spin orientations is available, for example by using ferromagnetic contacts in a transport measurement, then additional structural information about the relative concentration of defects on each edge can be derived.</p>

            <p>The protection against backscattering of spin-momentum-locked metallic edge states makes quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) highly appealing for spintronic applications, offering exceptional resilience against non-magnetic disorder. This protection arises from the time-reversal symmetry of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, which prohibits single-particle backscattering within a single Kramers pair. However, backscattering remains possible between energy-degenerate helical edge states not linked by time-reversal symmetry, as can occur in strongly non-linear edge dispersions with multiple Kramers pairs. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling of energy-degenerate helical edge states, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings extend the conventional understanding of backscattering protection beyond idealized linear dispersions to more realistic, nonlinear edge-mode configurations. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their topological protection.</p>

            <p>The search for chiral topological superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator (TI)-FeTe heterostructures is a key frontier in condensed matter physics, with potential applications in topological quantum computing. The combination of ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topologically nontrivial surface states brings together the key elements required for chiral Majorana physics. In this work, we examine the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity at the interfaces between FeTe and a series of TI overlayers. In superconducting MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/FeTe, any interfacial suppression of antiferromagnetism must affect at most a few nanometers. On the other hand, (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$/FeTe layers exhibit near-total suppression of antiferromagnetic ordering. Ferromagnetic Cr$_x$(Bi,Sb)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ (CBST)/FeTe bilayers exhibit net magnetization in both CBST and FeTe layers, with evidence of interactions between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. These observations identify magnetic TI/FeTe interfaces as an exceptionally robust platform to realize chiral topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Cells attach to their environment by means of focal adhesions, which are molecular complexes that exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt to mechanical load by changing their size. Drawing from the biomolecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, we present a generic model for mechanically induced adhesion growth where conformational states of molecules already in the adhesion cluster are coupled to the adsorption of further molecules. For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.</p>
