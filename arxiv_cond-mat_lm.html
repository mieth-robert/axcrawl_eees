            <h2>Strong coupling of polaritons at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Alnatah, Shuang Liang, Qiaochu Wan, Jonathan Beaumariage, Ken West, Kirk Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Man Chun Alan Tam, Zbigniew R. Wasilewski, David W. Snoke</p>
            <p>We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometric photocurrents of quasiparticles in superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kaplan, Kevin P. Lucht, Pavel A. Volkov, J.H. Pixley</p>
            <p>Nonlinear optical response is a sensitive probe of the geometry and symmetry of electronic Bloch states in solids. Here, we extend this notion to the Bogoliubiov-de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles in superconductors. We present a theory of photocurrents in superconductors and show that they sensitively depend on the quantum geometry of the BdG excitation spectrum. For all light polarizations, the photocurrent is proportional to the quantum geometric tensor: for linear polarized light it is related to the quantum metric and for circular polarization -- the Berry curvature dipole of the associated BdG bands. We further relate the photocurrent to the ground state symmetries, providing a symmetry dictionary for the allowed photocurrent responses. For light not at normal incidence to the sample, photocurrent probes time-reversal symmetry breaking in systems with chiral point groups (such as twisted bilayers). We demonstrate that photocurrents allow to probe topology and TRS breaking in twisted $d$-wave superconductors and test the nature of superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ and multilayer stacks of rhombohedral graphene. Our results pave the way to contactless measurement of the quantum geometric properties and symmetry of superconductivity in materials and heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms</h2>

            <p>Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.</p>

            <p>We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for topological origin of large spin-shift current in antiferromagnetic Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Sufyan, Hasan M. Abdullah, J. Andreas Larsson, Alexander C. Tyner</p>
            <p>The shift current is a non-linear photocurrent generally associated with the underlying quantum geometry. However, a topological origin for the shift photocurrent in non-centrosymmetric systems has recently been proposed. The corresponding topological classification goes beyond the ten-fold paradigm and is associated with the presence of a reverting Thouless pump (RTP). In this work we examine an antiferromagnetic monolayer within the family of MXenes, Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$. This material is centrosymmetric, however, magnetic ordering violates inversion symmetry. We demonstrate evidence of an RTP in each spin-sector which has been perturbed, destroying quantization of the invariant. Nevertheless, a giant spin-resolved shift current persists. We further investigate the mid-gap edge states and classification of the system as a fragile topological insulator to which trivial bands have been coupled.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Correlated Insulators and Superconductor at $ν=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunghoon Kim, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Xuepeng Wang, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</p>

            <h2>Transport Signatures of Radial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling at Ferromagnet/Superconductor Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Costa, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerging at the interfaces of superconducting magnetic tunnel junctions is at the heart of multiple unprecedented physical phenomena, covering triplet proximity effects induced by unconventional (spin-flip) Andreev reflections, giant transport magnetoanisotropies, sizable tunneling anomalous Hall effects, and electrically controlled current-reversing $ 0 $--$ \pi $(-like) transitions in Josephson contacts. Recent first-principles calculations proposed that the Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide and van der Waals multilayers can -- owing to broken mirror symmetries -- exhibit an unconventional radial component (with spin parallel to the electron's momentum), which can be quantified by the Rashba angle $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $. We theoretically explore the ramifications of radial Rashba SOC at the interfaces of vertical ferromagnet/superconductor tunnel junctions with a focus on the magnetoanisotropies of the tunneling and tunneling-anomalous-Hall-effect conductances. Our results demonstrate that $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $ can be experimentally extracted from respective magnetization-angle shifts, providing a robust way to probe the radial Rashba SOC induced by twisted multilayers that are placed as tunneling barriers between ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes.</p>

            <h2>Universal Turbulent States of Miscible Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Issei Doki, Makoto Tsubota</p>
            <p>We investigate turbulence in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a box potential using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Turbulence is driven by an oscillating force, causing the components to oscillate either in-phase (co-oscillating) or out-of-phase (counter-oscillating). A parameter measuring component separation (0 for overlap, 1 for full separation) reveals two turbulent states: coupled (the parameter $\sim0$) and decoupled (the parameter $\sim0.5$). Co-oscillating flows transition between these states at a critical interaction strength, while counter-oscillating flows consistently show the decoupled state. A probabilistic model predicts the decoupled state's parameter as $\sqrt{4/\pi - 1} = 0.523$, consistent with simulations.</p>

            <h2>Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman</p>
            <p>For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.</p>

            <h2>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Arpan Saha, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</p>

            <h2>Quasi-Large Hole Polarons in BiVO4-Implications for Photocatalysis and Solar Energy Conversion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhimeng Hao, Taifeng Liu</p>
            <p>Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4 BVO) is a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion, but its efficiency is limited by small polaron formation. However, some physical properties of BVO deviate from typical small polaron behavior. Using the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that BVO forms a quasi-large hole polaron with a radius around 2 nm, resembling free carriers with high mobility. This polaron is stabilized primarily by acoustic phonon modes, creating a shallow trap state near the valence band maximum, which prolongs its lifetime. Simultaneously, it retains a redox potential comparable to that of free carriers. We propose that such large polarons explain the superior properties of BVO and other transition metal oxide photocatalysts. Tuning phonon modes to stabilize large polarons offers a promising strategy for designing materials with enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Exceptionally High Nonlinear Optical Response in Two-dimensional Type II Dirac Semimetal Nickel di-Telluride (NiTe2)</h2>

            <p>Nickel ditelluride (NiTe2) is a newly identified Type-II Dirac semimetal, showing novel characteristics in electronic transport and optical experiments. In this study, we explored the nonlinear optical properties of two-dimensional NiTe2 using experimental and computational techniques (density functional theory-based approach). Few layered two-dimensional NiTe2 (2D-NiTe2) are synthesized using liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), which is characterized using X-ray diffraction technique, transmission electron, and atomic force microscopy. The nonlinear refractive index and third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the prepared 2D-NiTe2 are determined from the self-induced diffraction pattern generated using different wavelengths ( 405, 532, and 650 nm) in the far field. In addition, the diffraction pattern generated by spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) is further verified by varying concentration (2D-NiTe2 in the IPA solvent), wavelength (of incoming laser beams), and cuvette width (active path length). The high value of third-order nonlinear susceptibility (in order of 10-9 e.s.u.) determined using SSPM in the 2D-NiTe2 can be attributed to the laser-induced hole coherence effect. Lastly, utilizing the reverse saturable absorption property of 2D-hBN, asymmetric light propagation is also demonstrated in the 2D-NiTe2/2D-hBN heterostructure.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing catalyst activity of two-dimensional C$_4$N$_2$ through doping for the hydrogen evolution reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Ipaves, João F. Justo, James M. de Almeida, Lucy V. C. Assali, Pedro Alves da Silva Autreto</p>
            <p>This study investigates the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of pristine and doped C$_4$N$_2$ nanosheets as potential electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The pristine C$_{36}$N$_{18}$ nanosheets exhibit limited HER activity, primarily due to high positive Gibbs free energies ($>$ 2.2 eV). To enhance catalytic performance, doping with B, Si, or P at the nitrogen site was explored. Among these systems, B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets exhibit the most promising catalytic activity, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero ($\approx$ -0.2 eV), indicating efficient hydrogen adsorption. Band structure, projected density of states, charge density, and Bader charge analyses reveal significant changes in the electronic environment due to doping. While stacking configurations (AA$'$A$''$ and ABC) have minimal effect on catalytic performance, doping - particularly with B -substantially alters the electronic structure, optimizing hydrogen adsorption and facilitating efficient HER. These findings suggest that B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets could serve as efficient cocatalysts when combined with metallic materials, offering a promising approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications.</p>

            <h2>Topological magnons and domain walls in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the magnetic excitations in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a hole filling factor of $\nu=1$, focusing on magnon and domain wall excitations. Using a generalized interacting Kane-Mele model, we obtain the quantum anomalous Hall insualtor ground state with spin polarization. The magnon spectrum is then computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing two low-energy topological magnon bands with opposite Chern numbers. To further explore the magnon topology, we construct a tight-binding model for the magnon bands, which is analogous to the Haldane model. We also calculate the energy cost of domain walls that separate regions with opposite Chern numbers and bind chiral edge states. Finally, we propose an effective spin model that describes both magnon and domain wall excitations, incorporating Heisenberg spin interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The coupling constants in this model are determined from the numerical results for magnons and domain walls. This model accounts for the Ising anisotropy of the system, captures the magnon topology, and allows for the estimation of the magnetic ordering temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of magnetic excitations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and offer new insights into collective excitations in moiré systems.</p>

            <h2>Storing quantum coherence in a quantum dot nuclear spin ensemble for over 100 milliseconds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry E. Dyte, Santanu Manna, Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Armando Rastelli, Evgeny A. Chekhovich</p>
            <p>States with long coherence are a crucial requirement for qubits and quantum memories. Nuclear spins in epitaxial quantum dots are a great candidate, offering excellent isolation from external environments and on-demand coupling to optical flying qubits. However, coherence times are limited to $\lesssim1$ ms by the dipole-dipole interactions between the nuclei and their quadrupolar coupling to inhomogeneous crystal strain. Here, we combine strain engineering of the nuclear spin ensemble and tailored dynamical decoupling sequences to achieve nuclear spin coherence times exceeding 100 ms. Recently, a reversible transfer of quantum information into nuclear spin ensembles has been demonstrated in quantum dots. Our results provide a path to develop this concept into a functioning solid-state quantum memory suitable for quantum repeaters in optical quantum communication networks.</p>

            <h2>High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</h2>

            <p>Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</p>

            <h2>Active Solids: Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fridtjof Brauns, Myles O'Leary, Arthur Hernandez, Mark J. Bowick, M. Cristina Marchetti</p>
            <p>The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic contact line dynamics dictate the emergent behaviors of particle rafts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranit Mukherjee, Zih-Yin Chen, Xiang Cheng, Sungyon Lee</p>
            <p>Fluid-fluid interfaces laden with discrete particles behave curiously like continuous elastic sheets, leading to their applications in emulsion and foam stabilization. Although existing continuum models can qualitatively capture the elastic buckling of these particle-laden interfaces -- often referred to as particle rafts -- under compression, they fail to link their macroscopic collective properties to the microscopic behaviors of individual particles. Thus, phenomena such as particle expulsion from the compressed rafts remain unexplained. Here, by combining systematic experiments with first-principle modeling, we reveal how the macroscopic mechanical properties of particle rafts emerge from particle-scale interactions. We construct a phase diagram that delineates the conditions under which a particle raft collapses via collective folding versus single-particle expulsion. Guided by this theoretical framework, we demonstrate control over the raft's failure mode by tuning the physicochemical properties of individual particles. Our study highlights the previously overlooked dual nature of particle rafts and exemplifies how collective dynamics can arise from discrete components with simple interactions.</p>

            <p>Cells and cellular organelles are encapsulated by nanometrically thin membranes whose main component is a lipid bilayer. In the presence of electric fields, the ion-impermeable lipid bilayer acts as a capacitor and supports a potential difference across the membrane. We analyze the charging dynamics of a planar membrane separating bulk solutions with different electrolyte concentrations upon the application of an applied uniform DC electric field. The membrane is modeled as a zero-thickness capacitive interface. The evolution of the electric potential and ions distributions in the bulk are solved for using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. Asymptotic solutions are derived in the limit of thin Debye layers and weak fields (compared to the thermal electric potential).</p>

            <h2>Why is the strength of a polymer network so low?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaswat Mohanty, Jose Blanchet, Zhigang Suo, Wei Cai</p>
            <p>Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the charge-density-wave superlattice of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Wang, Patrick Liu, Lijun Wu, Jing Tao, Genda Gu, Alfred Zong, Yimei Zhu</p>
            <p>A number of intriguing phenomena, including exciton condensation, orbital ordering, and emergence of chirality, have been proposed to accompany charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$. Explaining these effects relies on knowledge of the atomic displacement pattern underlying the CDW, yet structural proposals based on spatially-averaging bulk crystal diffraction and surface-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy have remained inconsistent. Here, we revisit the CDW superlattice structure with selected-area electron diffraction, a bulk-sensitive probe capable of capturing sub-micrometer spatial variations while maintaining high momentum resolution. We resolved two distinct, spatially separated CDW phases characterized by different interlayer ordering. In both phases, previously reported atomic displacement patterns fail to account for the observed extinction rules. Instead, our analysis reveals a new superlattice structure, which features a large number of nearly degenerate CDW domains. These findings not only provide a new basis for understanding the gyrotropic electronic order and metastability in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, they also underscore the importance of bulk-sensitive mesoscopic techniques in investigating materials that host unconventional superlattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. Conversely, for an initially flat-band system with compactly localized wave functions, the NESS is delocalized. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial state is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial state weakens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

            <h2>High Quality Single Crystal of Kitaev Spin Liquid Candidate Material RuBr3 Synthesized under High Pressure</h2>

            <p>Kitaev quantum spin liquids have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics over the past decade. To understand their emergent quantum phenomena, high-quality single crystals of substantial size are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate RuBr3, achieving millimeter-sized crystals through a self-flux method under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The crystals exhibit well-defined cleavage planes with a lustrous appearance. Transport characterizations exhibit a narrow band-gap semiconducting behavior with 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV band-gap in ab plane and along c axis, respectively. Magnetic measurement shows a transition to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at approximately 29 K both in ab plane and along c axis. Notably, the Néel temperature increases to 34 K with an applied magnetic field of up to 7 T in the ab plane, but without any change along c axis. The large size and high quality of RuBr3 single crystals provide a valuable platform for investigating various interactions, particularly the Kitaev interaction, and for elucidating the intrinsic physical properties of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. S. Glavatskiy</p>
            <p>A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the conditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identified. A rigorous threshold between ``slow" and ``fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expression for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Competition Between Multiferroic and Magnetic Soliton Lattice States in DyFeO$_3$</h2>

            <p>Simultaneous breaking of time reversal and inversion symmetries in multiferroics couples ferroelectricity to magnetism and is a source of unusual physical phenomena that can be used in next-generation electronic devices. A notable example is DyFeO$_3$, which under applied magnetic fields exhibits a giant linear magnetoelectric response and a large spontaneous electric polarization induced by coexisting orders of Fe and Dy spins. Here, we use high-resolution neutron diffraction to show that at zero field DyFeO$_3$ hosts an incommensurate magnetic soliton lattice formed by spatially ordered Dy domain walls with an average domain size of 231(8) Å. The long-ranged interaction between the domain walls is mediated by magnons propagating through the Fe subsystem and is analogous to the Yukawa force in particle physics. An applied magnetic field destroys the long-ranged incommensurate order, unlocks the linear magnetoelectric response and stabilizes the ferroelectric state. The magnetic domain walls are electrically charged and the soliton array dimerizes when both electric and magnetic fields are applied. Numerical simulations with experimental parameters suggest, that the generic competition between the ferroelectric and incommensurate states can be effectively controlled by an applied electric field.</p>

            <h2>Weak coupling approach to magnetic and orbital susceptibilities for superconducting states in multiorbital electron-phonon coupled model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natsuki Okada, Tatsuya Miki, Shintaro Hoshino</p>
            <p>Alkali-doped fullerides are molecular-based superconductors with multiple active orbitals. In this paper, using the Eliashberg theory with the retardation effect of Jahn-Teller phonons, we study the response of the spin-singlet superconducting state relevant to fulleride materials. The spin Zeeman field is not active for the singlet pairing state, and the magnetic orbital field, which physically generates a circular electron motion inside the fullerene molecule, is also shown to be inactive. On the other hand, the electric orbital (or quadrupolar) field, which corresponds to a uniaxial distortion, remains active across the superconducting phase transition. This is understood by the orbital-symmetric structure of the Cooper pair, which is susceptible to the electric orbital field, while it is not the case for the magnetic orbital field which tends to create an antisymmetric part.</p>

            <h2>High-Temperature Superconductivity from Finite-Range Attractive Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry Miserev, Joel Hutchinson, Herbert Schoeller, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss</p>
            <p>In this letter we consider $D$-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids, and demonstrate that an attractive interaction with a finite range $R_s$ that is much greater than the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F$ breaks the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the BCS prediction of a finite superconducting gap for all attractive contact interactions, we show that a finite-range interaction does not induce a superconducting gap. Instead, the pair susceptibility develops a power-law singularity at zero momentum and zero frequency signaling quantum critical behavior without long-range ordering. Starting from this, we show that superconductivity can be stabilized by adding a short-range attractive interaction, which is always present in real electronic systems. As an example, we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional material with attractive electron-electron interactions mediated by optical phonons. We demonstrate a dome shape of the critical temperature $T_c$ versus doping, strongly suppressed isotope effect, and a weak dependence of the optimal doping and maximal $T_c^* \sim 0.1 E_F$ on the interaction range at $R_s \gg \lambda_F$, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. We believe that these results could be relevant to high-temperature superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Bose-Bose gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions: a droplet phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emerson Chiquillo</p>
            <p>Through an effective quantum field theory within Bogoliubov's framework and taking into account nonuniversal effects of the interatomic potential we analytically derive the leading Gaussian zero- and finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state of ultracold interacting Bose-Bose gases. We calculate the ground-state energy per particle at zero and low temperature for three- two- and one-dimensional two-component bosonic gases. By tuning the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of a self-bound liquidlike phase or droplet with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions DNUC) is favorable. At zero temperature in three-dimensions and considering the nonuniversal corrections to the attractive interactions as a fitting parameter the energy per particle for DNUC is in good agreement with some diffusion Monte Carlo results. In two dimensions the DNUC present small deviations regarding conventional droplets. For the one-dimensional DNUC the handling of the nonuniversal effects to the interactions achieves a qualitative agreement with the trend of some available Monte Carlo data in usual droplets. We also introduce some improved Gross-Pitaevskii equations to describe self-trapped DNUC in three, two and one dimension. We briefly discuss some aspects at low temperature regarding nonuniversal corrections to the interactions in Bose-Bose gases. We derive the dependencies on the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions but also on the difference between intra- and inter-species coupling constants. This last dependence crucially affect the three- and the two-dimensional DNUC driving thus to a thermal-induced instability. This thermal instability is also present in one-dimensional Bose-Bose gases, but it is not relevant on the formation of DNUC...</p>

            <h2>Phase-change materials for volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal device applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huandong Chen, Jayakanth Ravichandran</p>
            <p>Volatile threshold resistive switching and neuronal oscillations in phase-change materials, specifically those undergoing metal-to-insulator and charge density wave transitions, offer unique attributes such as fast and low-field volatile switching, tunability, and non-linear behaviors. These characteristics are particularly promising for emulating neuronal behavior and thus hold great potential for realizing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of neuronal oscillator devices based on three archetypal electronic phase-change materials: the correlated oxide VO2, the charge density wave transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, and the emerging phase-change chalcogenide perovskite BaTiS3. We discuss progress from the perspective of materials development, including structural phase transitions, synthesis methods, electrical properties, and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Hall {\color{black} e}ffect (AHE) has emerged as a key indicator of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) and topological features in electronic band structures. Absent of a magnetic field, the AHE requires spontaneous TRSB but has proven hard to probe due to averaging over domains. The anomalous component of the Hall effect is thus frequently derived from extrapolating the magnetic field dependence of the Hall response. We show that discerning whether the AHE is an intrinsic property of the field free system becomes intricate in the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations. {\color{black}As a study case,} we use the Weyl semimetal PrAlGe, where TRSB can be toggled via a ferromagnetic transition, providing a transparent view of the AHE's topological origin. Through a combination of thermodynamic, transport and muon spin relaxation measurements, we contrast the behaviour below the ferromagnetic transition temperature to that of strong magnetic fluctuations above. Our results {\color{black}on PrAlGe provide general insights into the} interpretation of anomalous Hall signals in systems where TRSB is debated, such as families of Kagome metals or certain transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajun Ma, Ruiya Zhan, Xiao Lin</p>
            <p>Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) generally emerge in superconducting systems where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, showing nonreciprocal current characteristics: nondissipative in one direction and ohmic in the opposite. Since the discovery of the SDEs by Ando et al. in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor [Nb/V/Ta]n in 2020, notable progress has been achieved on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. It has been proposed that intrinsic SDEs are closely linked to various exotic superconducting states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, topological superconductivity, and chiral superconductivity. Recently, SDEs have emerged as important experimental tools for detecting symmetry breaking in exotic superconducting states. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental nature of SDEs but also opens new possibilities for their applications in superconducting physics and related fields. This review focuses on the recent experimental progress in the observation of the SDEs and discusses their primary mechanisms from the perspective of material properties and symmetry breaking. Finally, we summarize the observed rectification efficiency of SDE devices and discuss future research directions in this rapidly developing field.</p>

            <h2>New insights into crystallographic relation and lattice dynamics effects in {CdO/MgO} superlattices grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Ewa Przezdziecka, Igor Perlikowski, Eunika Zielony, Abinash Adhikari, Anastasiia Lysak</p>
            <p>This article explores the structural properties of molecular beam epitaxy grown {CdO/MgO} superlattices on sapphire substrates of different crystallographic orientations (a-, c-, r-, and m-plane). The investigations involve a comprehensive analysis using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution X-ray diffraction studies unveil a significant influence of surface symmetry on both the substrates and the epitaxial layers, particularly with respect to the occurrence of twins in the superlattices. Remarkably, no twins are observed on r-oriented sapphire substrates, resulting in improved interface and crystallographic quality. The results of studies demonstrated in this work show that the growth rate of CdO sublayers within {CdO/MgO} superlattices is intricately dependent on the substrate orientation. Notably, the c-plane and m-plane sapphire substrates yielded thicker CdO sublayers, indicating comparable growth rates for these crystallographic orientations. Conversely, the a-plane and r-plane orientations seemed to favor a slower growth rate of CdO sublayers.</p>

            <p>The layer-resolved quantum transport response of a twisted bilayer graphene device is investigated by driving a current through the bottom layer and measuring the induced voltage in the top layer. Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.</p>

            <p>We study the desorption mechanism of hydrogen isotopes from graphene surface using first-principles calculations, with focus on the effects of quantum tunneling. At low temperatures, quantum tunneling plays a dominant role in the desorption process of both hydrogen monomers and dimers. In the case of dimer desorption, two types of mechanisms, namely the traditional one-step desorption in the form of molecules (molecular mechanism), and the two-step desorption in the form of individual atoms (atomic mechanism) are studied and compared. For the ortho-dimers, the dominant desorption mechanism is found to switch from the molecular mechanism to the atomic mechanism above a critical temperature, which is respectively ~ 300 K and 200 K for H and D.</p>

            <p>We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</p>

            <p>The kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$ forms a series of compounds, wherein the chemical pressure realized by the $A-$site cation tunes the spin exchange in the frustrated distorted kagome lattice. Via hydrothermal synthesis we have grown single crystals of the whole series for $A=$ rare-earths and found a clear structural transition to a superstructure variant at a specific chemical pressure level exerted by $A$~=~Dy. Phases with crystal structures in the vicinity of this superstructure transition realize a distorted kagome lattice of the Cu$^{2+}$ cations with characteristic features of a spin liquid. Here, subtle structural disorder as well as controlled chemical pressure can stabilize the spin liquid phase. We study the crystal structure and the magnetic ground state of these phases via single crystal x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and muon spin spectroscopy measurements.</p>

            <p>The studies of this paper on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain at finite temperatures T>0 have two complementary goals. The first is to identify the spin carriers of all its Sq>0 energy eigenstates and to show that their spin elementary currents fully control the spin-transport quantities. Here Sq is the q-spin of the continuous SUq(2) symmetry of the model for anisotropy >1. To achieve this goal, our studies rely on a suitable exact physical-spin this http URL the spin stiffness and the zero-field spin-diffusion constant are expressed in terms of thermal expectation values of the square of the elementary currents carried by the spin carriers. Our second goal is to confirm that the zero-field and finite-temperature spin transport is normal diffusive for anisotropy >1. We use two complementary methods that rely on an inequality for the T>0 spin stiffness and the above thermal expectation values, respectively, to show that the contributions to ballistic spin transport vanish. Complementarily, for T>0 and anisotropy >1, the spin-diffusion constant is found to be finite and enhanced upon lowering T, reaching its largest yet finite values at low temperatures. Evidence suggests that it diverges in the anisotropy limit to 1 for T>0, consistent with T>0 anomalous superdiffusive spin transport at anisotropy 1 and zero field.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the magnetization angle dependence $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of MnTe altermagnetic candidate. In high magnetic fields, experimental $M(\alpha)$ curves nearly independent of temperature, they mostly reflect standard antiferromagnetic spin-flop processes below the Néel vector reorientation field. In contrast, $M(\alpha)$ dependences are quite unusual at low temperatures and in low magnetic fields: below 81~K, spontaneous magnetization appears as a sharp $M(T)$ magnetization jump, the easy axis direction is equally $\pi/2$ rotated either by increasing the field above 1~kOe or the temperature above 81~K. We provide experimental arguments that the spontaneous magnetization of MnTe below 81~K differs strongly from the well known weak ferromagnetism of conventional antiferromagnetics, thus, it requires to take into account formation of the altermagnetic ground state. Despite the MnTe altermagnetic state is expected to be g-wave, i.e. $\pi/3$ periodic one, our experiment confirms the prevailing population of one from three easy axes, as it has been shown previously by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.</p>

However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta</p>
            <p>We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty are more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb by employing a mean-field approximation. Further, we explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</p>

            <p>Interest in studying the conductive properties of networks made from randomly distributed nanowires is due to their numerous technological applications. Although the sheet resistance of such networks can be calculated directly, the calculations require many characteristics of the system (distributions of lengths, diameters and resistances of nanowires, distribution of junction resistance), the measurement of which is difficult. Furthermore, such calculations can hardly offer an analytical dependence of the sheet resistance on the basic physical parameters of the systems under consideration. Although various theoretical approaches offer such analytical dependencies, they are often based on more or less reasonable assumptions rather than rigorously proven statements. Here, we offer an approach based on Foster's theorem to reveal a dependence of the sheet resistance of dense nanowire networks on the main parameters of such networks. This theorem offers an additional perspective on the effective medium theory and extends our insight.</p>

            <p>High intensity coherent light can dress matter, realizing new hybrid phases that are not accessible in equilibrium. This effect results from the coherent interaction between Bloch states inside the solid and the periodic field of impinging photons which produces hybrid light-matter states called Floquet-Bloch states that can alter properties of the solid. Optically inducing a topological state in a semiconductor using so-called Floquet engineering is an exciting prospect. However, it has not been realized, despite its theoretical prediction more than 10 years ago. Here we show that an ultrashort-lived topological state that is absent at equilibrium in the ground state of SnTe can be created with femtosecond light pulses. This occurs when the photoexcitation is similar in energy with the band gap of this polar semiconductor. We observe a concomitant renormalization of the band dispersions that reveals the generation of Floquet states connecting to the topological state. We therefore provide the first direct experimental observation of a Floquet topological state and propose that it is driven by a light-induced band inversion in SnTe. Our discovery opens the way for controlling optically on-demand the topological properties of semiconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Begué, Maria Grazia Proietti, José Ignacio Arnaudas, Miguel Ciria</p>
            <p>The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</p>

            <h2>Review on thermoelectric properties of transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Pallecchi, N. Manca, B. Patil, L. Pellegrino, D. Marre'</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered an advantageous alternative to their celebrated two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals akin compound, graphene, for a number of applications, especially those requiring a gapped and possibly tunable band structure. Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator.</p>

            <h2>Irreversible multi-band effects and Lifshitz transitions at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface under field effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilaria Pallecchi, Nicolo' Lorenzini, Mian Akif Safeen, Musa Mutlu Can, Emiliano Di Gennaro, Fabio Miletto Granozio, Daniele Marre'</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the irreversible effects of an applied electric field on the magnetotransport properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 conducting interfaces, with focus on their multiband character. We study samples of different types, namely with either crystalline or amorphous LaAlO3 overlayer. Our two-band analysis highlights the similarity of the electronic properties of crystalline and amorphous interfaces, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities. Furthermore, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns, at least in qualitative terms, in the two types of samples. In agreement with previous works on crystalline interfaces, we observe that an irreversible charge depletion takes place after application of a first positive back gate voltage step. Such charge depletion affects much more, in relative terms, the higher and three-dimensional dyz, dzx bands than the lower and bidimensional dxy, driving the system through the Lifshitz transition from two-band to single band behavior. The quantitative analysis of experimental data evidences the roles of disorder, apparent in the depletion regime, and temperature. Noteworthy, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns in crystalline and amorphous samples, at least in qualitative terms, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities.</p>

            <h2>Topology from Nothing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</p>

A customized tapered sample shape is fabricated using focused ion beam milling with the aim to optimize each imaging technique's field of view, facilitating high-resolution analysis of small volumes containing single particles, while also allowing for large-scale studies of thousands of particles for statistical relevance. By correlating data from same locations in different imaging modalities, the approach enhances the precision of quantitative analyses. The study highlights the importance of cross-scale, correlative three-dimensional microscopy for a comprehensive understanding of complex hierarchical materials.

            <p>Approaching phase boundaries in many-body systems can give rise to intriguing signatures in their excitation spectra. Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate nonreciprocal control of the speed of light by sending a microwave pulse through a cavity magnonics device. In contrast to reciprocal group velocity controlled by conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect, incorporating dissipative magnon-photon coupling establishes a non-reciprocal EIT effect, allowing slow and fast light propagation in opposite directions at the same frequency with comparable amplitude. Remarkably, reversing the magnetic field enables a directional switch between non-reciprocal fast and slow light. This discovery may offer new possibilities for pulse time regulation in microwave signal communications, neuromorphic computing, and quantum signal processing.</p>

            <h2>The Vendiscope: An Algorithmic Microscope For Data Collections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amey P. Pasarkar, Adji Bousso Dieng</p>
            <p>The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures and phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics -- and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a powerful tool for data-driven science.</p>

            <p>In this work, we establish the equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and quantum Green's functions. Drawing on the analogy between margin maximization in SVMs and action extremization in Lagrangian mechanics, we show that many standard kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions and that this correspondence arises from the inversion of physical operators. We further demonstrate how positive semi-definiteness, which is essential for valid SVM kernels, aligns with the spectral properties that ensure well-defined Green's functions. We employ the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) to create custom kernels for cases where the commonly employed kernels don't lead to a convergence. These custom kernels approximate the desired Green's functions. We furthermore demonstrate numerically on examples taken from physical problems, such as electrical conductivity, scattering amplitudes, photonic crystals, and energy levels of anharmonic oscillators, that selecting kernel functions that mirror the mathematical form of the associated Green's function can significantly enhance the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.</p>

            <p>Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. Here, we present a new design based on virtual load, where a low-frequency coil with a frequency of up to 30\,MHz, functions as both an inductor and a power-sharing element in a capacitive transformer circuit. This design enables a highly efficient RF circuit with tunable matching bandwidth. It integrates broadband and narrowband coils into a compact configuration, overcoming the distance limitations of metallic chambers. The broadband RF system, tested in a 10-second evaporative cooling experiment, reduced input power from 14.7\,dBW to -3.5\,dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10\,$\mu$K. The narrowband RF system was tested in a Landau-Zener experiment and transferred 80\,\% of Rb atoms from |F=2, m_F=2> to |2, -2> in 1 second, yielding a Rabi frequency of 7.6\,kHz at 0.1\,dBW. The power-sharing properties of the virtual load ensure impedance closely matches the ideal lumped-element simulations, demonstrating the design's robustness to disturbances.</p>

Here, we connect a time crystal formed of magnetic quasiparticles, magnons, to a mechanical resonator, a gravity wave mode on a nearby liquid surface, and show that their joint dynamics evolves as a cavity optomechanical system. Our results pave way for exploiting the spontaneous coherence of time crystals in an optomechanical setting and remove the experimental barrier between time crystals and other phases of condensed matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Gahlmann, Philippe Tassin</p>
            <p>Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.</p>

            <p>Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</p>

            <p>Atomically thin semiconductors exhibit tunable exciton resonances that can be harnessed for dynamic manipulation of visible light in ultra-compact metadevices. However, the rapid nonradiative decay and dephasing of excitons at room temperature limits current active excitonic metasurfaces to few-percent efficiencies. Here, we leverage the combined merits of pristine 2D heterostructures and non-local dielectric metasurfaces to enhance the excitonic light-matter interaction, achieving strong and electrically tunable exciton-photon coupling at ambient conditions in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface. Using this, we realize a free-space optical modulator and experimentally demonstrate 9.9 dB of reflectance modulation. The electro-optic response, characterized by a continuous transition from strong to weak coupling, is mediated by gating-induced variations in the free carrier concentration altering the excitons nonradiative decay rate. These results highlight how hybrid-2D excitonic metasurfaces offer novel opportunities to realize nanophotonic devices for active wavefront manipulation and optical communication.</p>

            <p>The accuracy of classical physical property predictions using molecular dynamics simulations is determined by the quality of the interatomic potentials. Here we introduce a training approach for empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) which is well suited for capturing phonons and phonon-related properties. Our approach is based on direct comparisons of the second- and third-order irreducible derivatives between an EIP and the Born-Oppenheimer potential within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Irreducible derivatives fully exploit space group symmetry and allow for training without redundant information. We demonstrate the fidelity of our approach in the context of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$, where we optimize parameters of an embedded-atom method potential in addition to core-shell interactions. Our EIPs provide thermophysical properties in good agreement with DFT and outperform widely utilized EIPs for phonon dispersion and thermal conductivity predictions. Reasonable estimates of thermal expansion and formation energies of Frenkel pairs are also obtained.</p>

            <p>Mutual information between local stress and local non-affine deformation is proposed as a collective field variable quantifying the {\em local softness} of soft materials. The liquid-solid transition in a simple liquid is considered as a generic example of mechanical transformation through varying correlation between stress and deformation at the microscopic level. Probing through this new measure, a liquid appears as a spatially heterogeneous medium of interacting interconnected regions of varying softness. In contrast, the soft regions shrink to isolated spots in the background of a negligible mean softness in the case of solids. In this view, the thermodynamic transition becomes purely geometric while keeping the essential mechanical information intact. Besides offering a general framework for understanding the mechanics of materials, this new approach can complement recent machine learning efforts by assigning physical meaning to their findings. Further, this collective variable can be used on the fly during material characterization as both of its ingredient variables are experimentally accessible.</p>

            <p>Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</p>

            <p>High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for high-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design of these magnets are not straightforward. In addition, many present designs use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an anisotropic bulk hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the MEMEP model. As a case study 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet is simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused. Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations. Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly reduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to calculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its devices.</p>

            <p>The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p>

In this study, we demonstrate ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a maximum coupling rate of 0.91. Our investigation shows the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. We compare coupling strength values derived from the gap size from the measured spectrum with those calculated directly through the coupling parameter and show that the gap size as a measure of coupling strength is limited for the ultra-strong coupling regime. Additionally, analytical calculations show the possibility to reach the deep-strong coupling regime by engineering the magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the potential of vdW AFMs as a model case to study magnetisation dynamics in low-symmetry magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang</p>
            <p>A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</p>

Specifically, we find zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental signatures of such responses.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Gauge Fields in Band Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyu Han, Steven Kivelson</p>
            <p>By explicit microscopic construction involving a mapping to a quantum vertex model subject to the `ice rule,' we show that an electronically `trivial' band insulator with suitable vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom can host a ``resonating valence-bond'' state - a quantum phase with emergent gauge fields. This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.</p>

            <h2>Vertex Representation of Hyperbolic Tensor Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matej Mosko, Maria Polackova, Roman Krcmar, Andrej Gendiar</p>
            <p>We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) for classical spin systems on hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p>4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.</p>

            <p>Spectroscopic data, particularly diffraction data, contain detailed crystal and microstructure information and thus are crucial for materials discovery. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are greatly effective in identifying crystals. Although machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced the analysis of powder XRD patterns, the progress is hindered by a lack of training data. To address this, we introduce SimXRD, the largest open-source simulated XRD pattern dataset so far, to accelerate the development of crystallographic informatics. SimXRD comprises 4,065,346 simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns, representing 119,569 distinct crystal structures under 33 simulated conditions that mimic real-world variations. We find that the crystal symmetry inherently follows a long-tailed distribution and evaluate 21 sequence learning models on SimXRD. The results indicate that existing neural networks struggle with low-frequency crystal classifications. The present work highlights the academic significance and the engineering novelty of simulated XRD patterns in this interdisciplinary field.</p>

            <h2>Insulating and metallic phases in the one-dimensional Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Insights from a backflow-inspired variational wave function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Piccioni, Francesco Ferrari, Michele Fabrizio, Federico Becca</p>
            <p>The interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions is studied in a one-dimensional lattice model, by means of a variational Monte Carlo method based on generalized Jastrow-Slater wave functions. Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Chu Lu, Shun-Hui Shi, Gaoyong Sun</p>
            <p>The Yang-Lee edge singularity is an intriguing critical phenomenon characterized by nonunitary field theory. However, its experimental realization for interacting many-body systems remains elusive. We show that Yang-Lee edge singularities, regarded as many-body exceptional points, can be observed using both the self-normal and the associated-biorthogonal Loschmidt echoes, leveraging the advantages of nonunitary dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. The Loschmidt echoes are demonstrated to display unitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime but exhibit nonunitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken regime, leading to a sharp change near an exceptional point. We hereby identify exceptional points in both the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model and the Yang-Lee model, and determine the critical exponent that is consistent with nonunitary conformal field theory. This work provides a direct observation of Yang-Lee edge singularities in non-Hermitian many-body systems arising from nonunitary dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yudi Yang, Wooil Yang, Young-Woo Son, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics have emerged as promising materials for advanced nanoelectronics, with their robust polarization and silicon compatibility making them ideal for high-density, non-volatile memory applications. Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</p>

In this perspective, we introduce recent advancements in the EdH effect and discuss its developments in three key aspects: the microscopic mechanism, its manifestation in topological systems, and chirality-selective magnon-phonon coupling. Our discussions aim to inspire further explorations of the EdH effect and highlight its promising applications in different areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David M T Kuo</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

            <h2>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Harandi, Hooman Danesh, Kevin Linka, Stefanie Reese, Shahed Rezaei</p>
            <p>A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than $1\,\%$ error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), enabling the mapping of microstructures to mechanical responses using solely physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields, Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. SPiFOL achieves significantly higher speed-up factors compared to conventional FFT solvers.</p>

We show, using time-resolved measurements of the magneto-optic Kerr effect, how the magnetic dynamics of the sublattices can be selectively manipulated by resonantly perturbing the Fe sublattice with ultrashort laser pulses. The mid-infrared excitation through intra-atomic Fe $d$-$d$ transitions triggers markedly slower dynamics in comparison to an off-resonant pumping affecting both of the two sublattices simultaneously. By changing probe wavelength to move in and out of resonance with the Fe $d$-$d$ transitions, we also show the specific contributions of the Fe sublattice to these dynamics.</p>

            <p>Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~44 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Wang, Wu-Rong Jian, Wei Cai</p>
            <p>Jogs, atomic-scale steps on dislocations, play an important role in crystal plasticity, yet they are often ignored in discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations due to their small sizes. While jogs on screw dislocations are known to move non-conservatively (i.e. climb) accompanied by vacancy emission, jogs on edge dislocations are commonly expected to move conservatively (i.e. glide) with the dislocation under ambient conditions. Here we report unexpected findings from molecular dynamics simulations of an edge dislocation containing a pair of unit jogs in face-centered cubic nickel at 300K. While the jogs glide conservatively with the edge dislocation at low stresses, we observe that one of the jogs climbs and emits vacancies intermittently at higher stresses. This observation is unexpected at such a low temperature, as climb is typically associated with temperatures closer to the creep temperature (roughly half of the melting temperature). Our results highlight the significance of the complex interplay between point defects (i.e., vacancies) and dislocations in room-temperature plasticity, suggesting that these interactions may be more significant than previously thought.</p>

Additionally, we establish a strong relationship between the number of renewals and the positional distribution in the context of large deviations.

In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</p>

            <p>The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. However, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of such superconductors severely limits the number of experimental techniques to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting transition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. A description of the $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$ data with an exponential form allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ lying between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.</p>

            <p>In moiré systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moiré structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moiré systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.</p>

            <h2>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. C. Levine, B. A. Friedman</p>
            <p>It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</p>

            <h2>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo</p>
            <p>Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</p>

            <p>Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near-surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.</p>

            <p>Electronic flat bands associated with quenched kinetic energy and heavy electron mass have attracted great interest for promoting strong electronic correlations and emergent phenomena such as high-temperature charge fractionalization and superconductivity. Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich non-trivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4. Simultaneously, it opens a new path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d-orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.</p>

            <h2>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordi Baró, Álvaro Corral</p>
            <p>Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</p>

            <p>RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

In this context we investigate different flow-based sampling algorithms, including a composite sampling algorithm where flow-based proposals are occasionally augmented by applying updates using traditional algorithms like HMC.</p>

            <h2>Quadratic Scaling Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</h2>

            <p>Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Goto, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>We propose a scheme to calibrate the internal parameters of a quantum annealer to obtain well-approximated samples for training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Empirically, samples from quantum annealers obey the Boltzmann distribution, making them suitable for RBM training. Quantum annealers utilize physical phenomena to generate a large number of samples in a short time. However, hardware imperfections make it challenging to obtain accurate samples. Existing research often estimates the inverse temperature for the compensation. Our scheme efficiently utilizes samples for RBM training also to estimate internal parameters. Furthermore, we consider additional parameters and demonstrate that they improve sample quality. We evaluate our approach by comparing the obtained samples with classical Gibbs sampling, which theoretically generates accurate samples. Our results indicate that our scheme demonstrates performance on par with Gibbs sampling. In addition, the training results with our estimation scheme outperform those of the contrastive divergence algorithm, a standard training algorithm for RBM.</p>

            <p>REBCO high-temperature superconductors are promising for fully superconducting high-field magnets, including ultra-high field magnets. Non-insulated (NI) and metal-insulated (MI) windings are a good solution for protection against electro-thermal quench. Design and optimization requires numerical modelling of REBCO inserts for high-field magnets. Here, we detail a fast and accurate two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional model for the electromagnetic response of NI and MI coils, which is based on the Minimum Electro Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP). Benchmarking with an $A-V$ formulation method on a double pancake coil shows good agreement. We also analyse a fully superconducting 32 T magnet with a REBCO insert and a low-temperature superconducing (LTS) outsert. In particular, we analyze the current density, the screening curren induced field (SCIF), and the AC loss. We have shown that metal-insulated coils enable transfer of angular current in the radial direction, and hence magnet protection, while keeping the same screening currents and AC loss of isolated coils, even at relatively high ramp rates of 1 A/s. Surprisingly, soldered coils with low resistance between turns present relatively low AC loss for over-current configuration, which might enable higher generated magnetic fields. The numerical method presented here can be applied to optimize high-field magnets regarding SCIF in MI or NI magnets. It also serves as the basis for future electro-thermal modelling and multi-physics modeling that also includes mechanical properties.</p>

For instance, it is known that the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature becomes linear in underdoped materials. In this paper, we investigate relation meticulously between the phase stiffness and the critical superconducting temperature for the Gubser-Rocha holographic superconductor model in the probe limit. The superfluid density (or phase stiffness) can be extracted from the low-frequency dependence of the AC conductivity. More importantly, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density on the critical superconducting temperature, which has a similarity to a recent experiment in a film cuprate. In addition, we also provide some approximate formulas for the critical temperatures and the AC conductivity.</p>

The ability of these tools to learn a target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled on the input data distribution. Targets that have support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. However, solving such eigenvalue problems on real-world data remains a challenge. Here, we consider cross-dataset learnability and show that one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data measures to reveal spectral bias on complex datasets and bound learnability on real-world data. This allows us to leverage various symmetries that realistic kernels manifest to unravel their spectral bias.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</p>

            <h2>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</p>

            <p>We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector-valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the considered phase field. The occurrence of non-normality requires to look at the pseudospectrum of the considered matrix, namely the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the matrix itself, because the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices can be very sensitive to small perturbations and therefore the spectral analysis alone would not be sufficient to distinguish with certainty between table and unstable behavior. We develop the relevant analyses in the case of quasicrystals for which the values of some constitutive parameters are not known or are uncertain from an experimental point of view, a circumstance suggesting parametric analyses. We find circumstances in which the pseudospectra obtained by means of the so-called structured perturbations predict instability when, instead, the spectral analysis indicates stability.</p>

            <p>A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</p>

            <p>Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors.</p>

            <p>Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.</p>

            <h2>Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanting Cheng, Shang Liu</p>
            <p>Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Romen, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>We propose a realistic semiconductor system containing bound states in the continuum (BICs) which allows for a practical realization. By varying the confinement strength of excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, we show that long-lived Rydberg states of the confined electron-hole pairs appear in the continuum background. The accuracy of calculations of the linewidths based on the coupled-channel Schrödinger equation with three channels and only few basis states is confirmed by a numerically exact solution employing a B-spline basis and the complex coordinate-rotation method. We argue that finite-sized cuprous oxide crystals, due to their large exciton binding energies, are a convenient platform for experimental identification of BICs.</p>

            <h2>Atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions under the influence of spin-dependent Rydberg molecular potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chih-Chun Chien, Seth T. Rittenhouse, S. I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour</p>
            <p>We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</p>

            <p>The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</p>

            <p>Josephson-junction interferometry has played a pivotal role in uncovering unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates. Using a Ginzburg-Landau-like approach, we generalize previous results to the genuine multi-gap case. Thus, we show that fractional flux oscillations of the Josephson critical current can arise as a direct consequence of multi-gap superconductivity. These oscillations reveal key information about the underlying superconducting states, including the unconventional $s_\pm$-wave state.

            <p>We consider the propagation of a classical microwave pulse through a simple setup of a quantum metamaterial composed of a large number of three-Josephson-junction flux qubits. We find that population inversion and electromagnetic waves propagate together as two-component nonlinear waves, exhibiting distinct features depending on the initial preparation of the qubit subsystem and the strength of the "matter"-light interaction. Three different regimes are observed. In the limit of weak nonlinearity, when all qubits are initially prepared in either the clockwise or counterclockwise persistent current state, population inversion undergoes coherent Rabi-like oscillations, with a complete transfer between these two opposite states. As nonlinearity approaches unity, the transition dynamics lose their oscillatory nature, and the system rapidly becomes frozen in a state of zero population inversion, where each qubit is trapped in a superposition with equal probabilities of clockwise and counterclockwise polarity. In the overcritical regime, population inversion exhibits pulsating behavior, but without complete transfer. In the extreme coupling limit, population inversion undergoes small-amplitude oscillations around its initial value, while the pulse amplitude oscillates around zero, indicating pulse stopping.</p>

            <p>Magnetic impurities in topological insulators (TIs) induce backscattering via magnetic torque, unlike pristine TIs where spin-orbit locking promotes dissipationless surface states. Here we reveal that one can suppress that unwanted backscattering and dissipation in magnetic TIs using high-frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). By carefully considering the hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface of the TI, we demonstrate how the coupling between Dirac surface states and LPL can effectively reduce backscattering on magnetic dopants, enhance carrier mobility and suppress resistance, even entirely.

            <p>The confinement of electromagnetic radiation to subwavelength scales relies on strong light-matter interactions. In the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) spectral ranges, phonon polaritons are commonly employed to achieve extremely subdiffractional light confinement, with much lower losses as compared to plasmon polaritons. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons in anisotropic materials offer a highly promising platform for light confinement, which, however, typically plateaus at values of {\lambda}0/100, with {\lambda}0 being the free-space incident wavelength. In this study, we report on ultraconfined phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides with confinement factors exceeding {\lambda}0/250 in the terahertz spectral range. This extreme light compression within deeply sub-wavelength thin films is enabled by the unprecedented magnitude of the light-matter coupling strength in these compounds, and the natural hyperbolicity of HfSe2 in particular. Our findings emphasize the critical role of light-matter coupling for polariton confinement, which for phonon polaritons in polar dielectrics is dictated by the transverse-longitudinal optic phonon energy splitting. Our results demonstrate transition metal dichalcogenides as an enabling platform for THz nanophotonic applications that push the limits of light control.</p>

            <p>We investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Xun Lin, Bowen Ma, Wesley Roberts, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Gregory A. Fiete</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field, the Josephson junction can enter the topological phase and host zero-energy Majorana bound states over a range of the superconducting phase difference centered around $\pi$, with the span of this range determined by the strength of the magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.</p>

            <p>We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Rényi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.</p>

            <p>RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models.

Theoretical analysis identifies strain-induced modifications in band nesting as the underlying mechanism for enhanced anisotropic carrier relaxation.

            <p>Recently, two-dimensional Nb$_2$C has garnered increasing attention due to its functional-group-dependent superconductivity, both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the halogen and chalcogen additives that have been the main focus of previous studies, we study the effect of lithium adsorption, which can also be incorporated during the synthesis of Nb$_2$C. Our computational analysis reveals a metal-to-superconductor transition in monolayer Nb$_2$C with a critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 22.1 K and a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution following the adsorption of lithium atoms. This emergent superconductivity is attributed to the increased electronic states at the Fermi energy, resulting from the contribution of Nb-$d$ orbitals and electron gas states induced by the low electronegativity of lithium. Furthermore, the application of tensile strain raises the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ to 24 K, which is higher than that of most functional-group-modified Nb$_2$C systems. Our work deepens the understanding of electron-phonon coupling in layered Nb$_2$C, and provides new insights into achieving high critical temperature superconductivity with a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution in this system.</p>

            <p>We investigated theoretically the transmission properties of Dirac Fermions tunneling through a periodically (sinusoidal and rectangular) driven electrostatic barrier in Monolayer graphene. For the time harmonic potential with moderate to high alpha (=amplitude/frequency) the central Floquet band is found to be almost cloaked for the Klein transmitted electron in contrast to electron at higher grazing incidences. As a time periodic drive, we mainly focused on the use of rectangular wave electric signal to modulate the transparency of the barrier. It is noted that the asymmetric Fano resonance, a characteristic feature of photon assisted tunneling, is more likely to occur for rectangular drive in contrast to the harmonic one. The height of the modulating potential is particularly responsible for the dressing effect of the barrier. The position and nature of the FR can be tailored by changing the height and frequency of the rectangular drive. Moreover, the duty cycle of the driving potential turns out to be an important controlling parameter for the transmission process. Thus, the rectangular modulation plays an important role for the occurrence and detection of the Fano resonances which is vital for the use of graphene nanostructure in the field of detectors, sensors, modulators etc. The present findings attempt for the first time, to realize the effect of duty cycle on the quantum interference in semiconductor nanostructures.</p>

            <p>The electric magnetochiral anisotropy is a nonreciprocal phenomenon accessible via second harmonic transport in noncentrosymmetric, time-reversal invariant materials, in which the rectification of current, ${\bf I}$, can be controlled by an external magnetic field, ${\bf B}$. Quantum geometry, which characterizes the topology of Bloch electrons in a Hilbert space, provides a powerful description of the nonlinear dynamics in topological materials. Here, we demonstrate that the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media owes its existence to the quantum metric, arising from the spin-orbit coupling, and to large Born effective charges. In this context, the reciprocal magnetoresistance $\beta{\bf B}^2$ is modified to $R( I,P,B)=R_0[1+\beta B^2 + \gamma^{\pm}{\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})]$, where the chirality dependent $\gamma^{\pm}$ is determined by the quantum metric dipole and the polarization ${\bf P}$. We predict a universal scaling $\gamma^{\pm}(V)\sim V^{-5/2}$ which we verified by phase sensitive, second harmonic transport measurements on hydrothermally grown 2D tellurium films under applied gate voltage, $V$. The control of rectification by varying ${\bf I}$, ${\bf P}$, ${\bf B}$, and $V$, demonstrated in this work, opens up new avenues for the building of ultra-scaled CMOS circuits.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of an InAs nanowire weak link embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy of spin-degenerate and spin-orbit split Andreev bound states for the shorter and longer weak links, respectively. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which results in a measured coupling strength reaching 1.95 GHz to the Andreev level and 77 MHz to the Andreev spin. Our spectroscopic data are in good agreement with existing theoretical models and demonstrate ultrastrong coupling to the Andreev pair qubit with the coupling strength approaching the bare resonator and qubit frequencies.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons flows within closed quantum circuits can spontaneously form phase-locked modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). With its infinite set of angular momentum quantum numbers, high-order OAM represents a transformative solution to the bandwidth bottleneck in multiplexed optical communication. However, its practical application is hindered by the limited choice of materials which in general requires cryogenic temperatures and the reliance on mechanical switching. In this work, we achieve stable and high-order (up to order of 33) OAM modes by constructing a closed quantum circuit using the halide perovskite microcavities at room temperature. By controlling the spatial and temporal symmetry of the closed quantum circuits using another laser pulse, we achieve significant tuning OAM of EP flows from 8 to 12. Our work demonstrate all-optical and ultrafast control of high-order OAM using exciton-polariton condensates in perovskite microcavities that would have important applications in high-throughput optical communications.</p>

            <p>A major obstacle to understanding high-Tc cuprates is that superconductivity precludes observing normal-state properties at low temperatures. One prime example is the normal-state spin susceptibility \c{hi}spin: although its decrease upon cooling far above Tc typifies pseudogap behavior, its behavior at low temperatures is generally unknown. Here, our measurements in high magnetic fields expose \c{hi}spin of YBa2Cu3Oy down to low temperatures. Even though superconductivity is suppressed by the field, we uncover two thermally-activated contributions alongside a residual \c{hi}spin(T=0) due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range charge-density waves and to the formation of singlets as in certain quantum spin systems. Both phenomena thus contribute to the pseudogap at low temperature, supplementing short-lived antiferromagnetism that initiates pseudogap behavior at high temperatures. We therefore propose that the pseudogap ought to be regarded as a composite property and that, when not undergoing spin-stripe ordering, underdoped cuprates tend to form short-ranged spin singlets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. L. McLanahan, A. P. Ramirez</p>
            <p>Ferrimagnets in which half the spins are disordered and half ordered, so-called half-fire, half-ice state, have been advanced theoretically as a route towards realizing exotic magnetic ground states. Here we demonstrate novel single-spin resonance in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice material. Using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz we find a Debye-like resonance with Orbach relaxation temperature dependence, yielding an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. These quantities strongly suggest single-spin relaxation among paramagnetic Sm spins where the flipping field is provided by the FM-ordered Mn spins at domain boundaries, a direct outcome of the 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice state.</p>

            <h2>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Lyublinskaya, P. A. Nosov, I. S. Burmistrov</p>
            <p>Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state - a dark state - with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the long-wavelength and long-time dynamics of the fermion densities and analyze them numerically. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. We also estimate the minimum system sizes required to observe this instability in finite systems. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</p>

            <h2>First return times on sparse random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg Evnin, Weerawit Horinouchi</p>
            <p>We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</p>

            <p>We measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, which is a candidate for altermagnets. From the Maxwell equations, we obtained matrix-type general formulae describing the optical propagation and reflection for arbitrary crystals. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses from the anisotropic organic crystal, which appeared at around the Néel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. These results eliminate the net canted-magnetization origin. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire $\pi$-electron band clearly shows two spectral end-peaks due to magnetic origin with a large energy scale compared with the very small spin-orbit interaction, and proportionality to anisotropic diagonal conductivities possibly in relation to the piezomagnetic effect. These results suggest the altermagnetic response of this material. We also discuss the analogy between the magnetization in ferromagnets and Néel vector with respect to the magneto-optical configurations.</p>

            <p>Metals owe their unique mechanical properties to how defects emerge and propagate within their crystal structure under stress. However, the mechanisms leading from the early emerging (local) defects to the amplification of dislocations (collective plastic events) are not easy to track. Here, using tensile-stress atomistic simulations of a Copper lattice as a case study, we revisit this classical problem under a new perspective based on local dynamics rather than on purely structural arguments. We use a data-driven approach that allows tracking how local fluctuations emerge and accumulate in the atomic lattice in space and time, anticipating/determining the emergence of local or collective structural defects during deformation. Building solely on the general concepts of local fluctuations and spatiotemporal fluctuation correlations, this approach allows characterizing in a unique way the evolution through the elastic, plastic, and fracture phases, describing metals as complex systems where collective phenomena originate from local dynamical triggering events.</p>

            <p>Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~88 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</p>

            <p>We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Boyer, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study the relaxation of a diffusive particle confined in an arbitrary external potential and subject to a non-Markovian resetting protocol. With a constant rate $r$, a previous time $\tau$ between the initial time and the present time $t$ is chosen from a given probability distribution $K(\tau,t)$, and the particle is reset to the position that it occupied at time $\tau$. Depending on the shape of $K(\tau,t)$, the particle either relaxes toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution or toward a non-trivial stationary distribution that breaks ergodicity and depends on the initial position and the resetting protocol. From a general asymptotic theory, we find that if the kernel $K(\tau,t)$ is sufficiently localized near $\tau=0$, i.e., mostly the initial part of the trajectory is remembered and revisited, the steady state is non-Gibbs-Boltzmann. Conversely, if $K(\tau,t)$ decays slowly enough or increases with $\tau$, i.e., recent positions are more likely to be revisited, the probability distribution of the particle tends toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann state at large times. In the latter case, however, the temporal approach to the stationary state is generally anomalously slow, following for instance an inverse power law or a stretched exponential, if $K(\tau,t)$ is not too strongly peaked at the current time $t$. These findings are verified by the analysis of several exactly solvable cases and by numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Inspired by previous studies in statistical physics [see, in particular, Kozitsky at al., A phase transition in a Curie-Weiss system with binary interactions, Condens. Matter Phys. 23, 23502 (2020)] we introduce a discrete Gauss-Poisson probability distribution function \begin{equation}\label{GPD}\tag{A1} p_{GP}(n ;z,r)=\left[R(r;z)\right]^{-1}\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2} \end{equation} with support on $\mathbb N_0$ and parameters $z\in\mathbb R$ and $r\in\mathbb R_+$. The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n ;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite sum \begin{equation}\label{R}\tag{A2} R(r;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2}, \end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We present an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\rm as)}(r;z\gg1)$ for the function $R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its logarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting oscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some threshold value $r^*$. Some implications of our findings are discussed in the context of the Curie-Weiss cell model of simple fluids.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider a renormalization group perspective on the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^N$ space through the complex landscape provided by a disordered Hamiltonian of type $2+p$. We focus on the large $N$ limit, where the coarse-graining procedure is unconventional: it is based on the Wigner spectrum of the rank-2 disorder. The main consequence of this choice is that canonical dimensions depend on the scale, and the flow equations fail to become autonomous, preventing the existence of global fixed points. One of the main features of the underlying renormalization group flow is the existence of finite-scale singularities for initial conditions sufficiently close to the Gaussian region and for rank-$p$ disorder intensity large enough. Using the Luttinger-Ward formalism, we show that these finite-scale singularities hide (and should be resolved by) a phase transition that breaks time-translation invariance.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <p>Previously, we have shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions. We will demonstrate the importance of it in electron conduction problems in metals in this work. We first revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire connected to an electric battery. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that a sensible explanation is given if the generation of the current is due to the chemical potential gradient generated inside the wire by the battery connection. Next, we demonstrate its importance in the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation of the Josephson relation does not include the capacitor contribution inherently exists in the junction. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force explains the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Gutierrez, Rodolfo Cuerno</p>
            <p>Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adil A. Gangat</p>
            <p>Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Wenyang Ding, Shouhang Li, Meng An, Gang Zhang</p>
            <p>As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.</p>

            <h2>Softening of Vibrational Modes and Anharmonicity Induced Thermal Conductivity Reduction in a-Si:H at High Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Yanzhou Wang, Penghua Ying, Shouhang Li, Cheng Shao, Wenyang Ding, Gang Zhang, Meng An</p>
            <p>Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Frustrated Metal</h2>

            <p>Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.</p>

            <h2>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordi Baró, Álvaro Corral</p>
            <p>Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</p>

            <h2>Local topological order and boundary algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Corey Jones, Pieter Naaijkens, David Penneys, Daniel Wallick</p>
            <p>We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincaré 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.</p>

            <p>When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. O. Oriekhov, Guliuxin Jin, Eliska Greplova</p>
            <p>We study the dynamical localization of discrete time evolution of topological split-step quantum random walk (QRW) on a single-site defect starting from a uniform distribution. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the high localization probability regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions contain two or more pairs of trapped states, forming near a lattice defect. By investigating the spectral properties of the discrete-time evolution operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial uniformly distributed state, thus offering a simple interpretation of the localization effect. As this localization scheme could be interpreted as a variation of spatial quantum search algorithm, we compare the localization probability and time with other types of two-dimensional quantum walks that do not have topological phases and realize localization time scaling similar to Grover's algorithm. Finally we show that mechanism of localization we identified is robust against the influence of disorder.</p>

            <h2>Black Box Work Extraction and Composite Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Watanabe, Ryuji Takagi</p>
            <p>Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory. We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca, Aurora Basinski-Ferris, Laure Zanna, Ming Zhao</p>
            <p>Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</p>

            <p>Static and dynamic stress changes in the Earth's crust induced by an earthquake typically trigger other earthquakes. Identifying such aftershocks is an important step in seismic hazard assessment but has remained challenging, especially in cases involving natural fluid migration or anthropogenic fluid injections, which can occur with varying time scales and/or episodically, leading to strong temporal variations in earthquake occurrences. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows one to determine whether indeed aftershocks are present. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we find that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.</p>

            <h2>Small Singular Values Matter: A Random Matrix Analysis of Transformer Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Staats, Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow</p>
            <p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI applications, understanding their inner workings is essential. In this work, we analyze the spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models through the lens of random matrix theory (RMT) to uncover learned structures. We find that certain regions of the weight matrix spectra deviate markedly from RMT predictions, indicating richer feature encoding. By comparing the corresponding singular vectors to eigenvectors of activation covariance matrices, we observe substantial overlap precisely where the spectra deviate from RMT expectations. Our analysis further reveals the important role of small singular values in LLMs, showing that these values contain significant information, a claim supported by increased perplexity when they are removed from the model. Although these small values may appear unimportant prior to task-specific fine-tuning, removing them afterward significantly degrades performance, revealing that fine-tuning refines the model primarily in these spectral regions. These results emphasize the critical role of small singular values, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya N. Singh, David T. Limmer</p>
            <p>The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.</p>

            <p>Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</p>

            <p>We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.</p>

For nonresonant pumping with below-gap photon energies, TR-ARPES spectra reveal distinct excitonic replica and quantum beats persisting in the incoherent regime. These are due to a coherence between different species of {\em incoherent} excitons. Such type of coherence is resistant to phonon dephasing, indicating that it follows different dynamics than those governing the coherences considered so far.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions (JJ) are essential for superconducting quantum technologies and searches of self-conjugate quasiparticles, pivotal for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.</p>

            <p>The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic structure was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phase as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic field-dependent pyroelectric current measurements revealed significantly higher magnetoelectric coupling at magnetic fields below 4 T than in pure TbMnO3. This is due to the higher sensitivity of the incommensurably modulated cycloid structure to weak magnetic fields. Detailed analysis of our data confirmed that the ferroelectric polarization is induced by inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for magnetic field strength up to 4 T, but at higher fields a departure from theoretical predictions is ascertained, giving evidence for an additional, as yet misunderstood, contribution to magnetoelectric coupling. It shows that a small 2% substitution of Mn3+ by Fe3+ has a strong impact on the magnetic structure, promoting the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T. We demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling magnitude can be tuned through suitable substitutional elements, even at low level, inducing local lattice distortions with different electronic and magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Spectral and Entanglement Properties of the Random Exchange Heisenberg Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilun Gao, Rudolf A. Römer</p>
            <p>We study the many-body localization problem in the non-abelian SU(2)-invariant random antiferromagnetic exchange model in 1D. Exact and sparse matrix diagonalization methods are used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix. We investigate the behaviour of the energy level gap-ratio statistic, participation ratio, entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectral parameter as a function of disorder strength. Different distributions of random couplings are considered. We find, up to $L=24$, a clear distinction between our non-abelian model and the more often studied random field Heisenberg model: the regime of seemingly localized behaviour is much less pronounced in the random exchange model than in the field model case.</p>

            <h2>Rabi and Ramsey oscillations of a Majorana qubit in a quantum dot-superconductor array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma, Chun-Xiao Liu</p>
            <p>The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance -- longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical kinetic energy quenching in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Borissov, Vladimir Calvera, Sung-Sik Lee</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of critical spin fluctuations and hot electrons at the metallic antiferromagnetic quantum critical points with $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ spin symmetries, building upon earlier works on the $O(3)$ symmetric theory. The interacting theories in $2+1$ dimensions are approached from $3+1$-dimensional theories in the $\epsilon$-expansion that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface as a control parameter. The low-energy physics of the $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ theories qualitatively differ from each other and also from that of the $O(3)$ theory. The difference is caused by higher-order quantum corrections beyond the one-loop order that are important even to the leading order in $\epsilon$. The naive loop-expansion breaks down due to dynamical quenching of kinetic energy: the speed of the collective mode ($c$) and the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ordering vector ($v$) become vanishingly small at low energies. What sets the three theories apart is the hierarchy that emerges between the quenched kinetic terms. At the infrared fixed point, $c/v$ becomes $0$, $1$ and $\infty$ in the $Z_2$, $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ theories, respectively. At intermediate energy scales, the slow renormalization group (RG) flows of $c$ and $v$ toward their fixed point values create approximate scale invariance controlled by approximate marginal parameters. The manifold of those quasi-fixed points and the RG flow therein determines crossovers from scaling behaviours with transient critical exponents at intermediate energy scales to the universal scaling in the low-energy limit. If the symmetry group is viewed as a tuning parameter, the $O(2)$ theory corresponds to a multi-critical point which has one additional quasi-marginal parameter than the other two theories.</p>

            <h2>Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-feng Yang</p>
            <p>The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.</p>

            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <p>Moiré systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have attracted significant attention due to their ability to host correlated phenomena including superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating states. By defining the single-particle Green's function in the band basis, we systematically develop a many-body perturbation theory framework to address correlations beyond the usual mean-field Hartree-Fock approaches. As a specific example, we first analyze twisted bilayer graphene within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive analytical solutions for symmetry-breaking states at integer fillings and the finite-temperature metal-insulator transition that closely match previously known numerical results in the literature. Moving beyond Hartree-Fock, we incorporate self-consistent GW corrections demonstrating that first-order diagrams significantly overestimate the filling-dependent fluctuations in the electronic compressibility. This framework provides a comprehensive pathway for exploring strong electronic correlations in moiré systems beyond mean-field, giving new insights into the interplay of symmetry breaking and electron correlations.</p>

            <p>Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A phase-slip junction, the dual of a Josephson junction, provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Phase-slip junctions have been challenging, however, to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters. Here we demonstrate the operation of a superconducting qubit based on a phase slip junction made using titanium nitride. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (~17 GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes >60 $\mu$s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the phase-slip junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephan Rachel, Roland Wiesendanger</p>
            <p>For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil S. Chellam, George C. Schatz</p>
            <p>Aluminum nanocrystals offer a promising platform for plasmonic photocatalysis, yet a detailed understanding of their electron dynamics and consequent photocatalytic performance has been challenging thus far due to computational limitations. Here, we employ density functional tight-binding methods (DFTB) to investigate the optical properties and H<sub>2</sub> dissociation dynamics of Al nanocrystals with varying sizes and geometries. Our real-time simulations reveal that Al's unique free-electron nature enables efficient light-matter interactions and rapid electronic thermalization. Cubic and octahedral nanocrystals ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 nm exhibit size-dependent plasmon resonances in the UV, with distinct spectral features arising from the particle geometry and electronic structure. By simulating H<sub>2</sub> dissociation near Al nanocrystals, we demonstrate that hot electrons generated through plasmon excitation can overcome the molecule's strong chemical bond within tens of femtoseconds. The laser intensity threshold is comparable to previous reports for Ag nanocrystals, though significantly lower than that of Au. Notably, the dipolar plasmon mode demonstrates higher efficiency for this reaction than the localized interband transition for particles at these sizes. Taken together, this work provides mechanistic insights into plasmon-driven catalysis and showcases DFTB's capability to study quantum plasmonics at unprecedented length and time scales.</p>

            <p>We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.</p>

            <p>We propose a general framework for designing a two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductor (TSC) using a magnet-superconductor hybrid system. This setup involves a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, which hosts noncoplanar magnetic textures, in proximity to a 2D $s$-wave superconducting layer. Serving as an alternative to $p$-wave superconductors, this configuration induces a topological superconducting phase and is a promising platform for realizing the 2D Kitaev model, which supports Majorana zero-energy modes through emergent $p$-wave symmetry superconducting pairing. Notably, the magnetic moments break time-reversal symmetry while the superconducting state preserves particle-hole symmetry, placing our system in the Altland-Zirnbauer class $D$ and ensuring robust Majorana excitations. We first perform density functional theory-based simulations to study a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, from which essential magnetic characteristic parameters, such as Heisenberg exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), are calculated using the state-of-the-art Liechtenstein-Katsnelson-Antropov-Gubanov (LKAG) approach. With a substantial DMI coupling exhibited in CrInTe$_3$, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal the stabilization of a noncoplanar spiral magnetic state as ground state. In this magnetic phase, we observe a transition from corner modes in the zero-energy local density of states (LDOS) to edge modes as the chemical potential ($\mu$) varies. Furthermore, under a finite magnetic field, the system enters a mixed magnetic state, characterized by isolated skyrmions and spiral domain walls, which lead to unique low-energy localization of electronic wave functions, rendering the system an insulator. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations of TSC in this magnet-superconductor interfacial system, using real-space probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

            <p>Realizing topological superconductivity in stoichiometric materials is a key challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, $M$IrGe ($M$ = Ti, Hf), as prime candidates for topological superconductivity, predicted to exhibit nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, we establish these materials as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in $M$IrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain- a ring of fourfold-degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states establishes $M$IrGe as a rare and robust platform to realize topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>In an electronic system, spontaneous symmetry breaking can arise from many-body interaction between electrons, leading to degenerate ground states distinguishable by emergent effects otherwise prohibited by the symmetry. Here we show that ultrastrong coupling of a mesoscopic electronic system to the vacuum of a cavity resonator can lead to another paradigm of spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries in both systems. As a pertinent example, we consider the orbital gyrotropic effects in a moiré superlattice embedded in a THz split ring cavity resonator. Our mean-field and exact diagonalization calculations consistently demonstrate a spontaneous parity symmetry breaking in both the electronic ground state and the cavity vacuum, leading to two degenerate hybrid ground states distinguished by their opposite orbital gyrotropic Hall and magnetic effects. These sizable responses in the cavity-embedded moiré superlattice are highly tunable by both the cavity field polarization and interlayer bias on the moiré superlattice, providing an advanced platform for manipulating gyrotropic effects.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</p>

            <p>The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.</p>

            <p>In this work we revisit the problem of a Majorana box qubit (MBQ) readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the MBQ are associated with the combined fermion parities of the MBQ and its tunnel-coupled quantum dot, which is measured by a PC detector. Beyond the existing studies on limiting bias voltage regimes, we analyze the steady-state current and the current power spectrum across all bias voltages. Our results indicate that the MBQ readout via the parity-dependent detector current is effective only at low bias voltage regime and requires the dot energy level to be off-resonance with the Majorana qubit. In contrast, the current power spectrum allows MBQ readout through the parity-dependent Rabi oscillation peak signals for arbitrary bias voltages, without restrictions on the dot energy level. Particularly, with focus on the MBQ measurement visibility, we analyze the peak-to-pedestal ratio for each characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. By examining these two metrics, we identify the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.</p>

            <h2>Mapping Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions to inversion asymmetry in perovskite oxide heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nirmal Ganguli, Avishek Singh, Vivek Kumar, Jayita Chakraborty</p>
            <p>Inversion asymmetry, combined with spin-orbit interaction, leads to Rashba or Dresselhaus effects, or combinations of them that are promising for technologies based on antiferromagnetic spintronics. Since understanding the exact nature of spin-orbit interaction is crucial for developing a technology based on it, mapping the nature of inversion asymmetry with the type of spin-orbit interaction becomes the key. We simulate a perovskite oxide heterostructure LaAlO$_3|$SrIrO$_3|$SrTiO$_3$ preserving the inversion symmetry within density functional theory to demonstrate the relation between the nature of inversion asymmetry and the corresponding Rashba or Dresselhaus-type interaction. With progressive distortion in the heterostructure, we find how the structure inversion asymmetry sets in with distorted bond lengths and bond angles, leading to Rashba effect in the system. Further, introduction of tilted IrO$_6$ octahedra leads to bulk inversion asymmetry, helping a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction to set in. A comparison of the spin textures obtained from our DFT calculations and theoretical modeling helps us identify the exact nature of the interactions. Besides demonstrating the connection between the nature of asymmetry with Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, our work may serve as a guide to identifying different types of Rashba-like spin-orbit interactions.</p>

            <h2>Effective grand-canonical description of condensation in negative-temperature regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi</p>
            <p>The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand-canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable and their lifetime $\tau$ is exponentially long with the temperature, $\tau \approx \exp(\lambda |T|)$ (for $T<0$). A general expression for $\lambda$ is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of non-interacting particles. In the DNLS model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant, makes $\lambda$ even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.</p>

            <h2>Strain stiffening due to stretching of entangled particles in random packings of granular materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Brown, Kevin A. Mitchell, Alice Nasto, Athanasios Athanassiadis, Heinrich M. Jaeger</p>
            <p>Stress-strain relations for random packings of entangling chains under triaxial compression can exhibit strain stiffening and sustain stresses several orders-of-magnitude beyond typical granular materials. X-ray tomography reveals the transition to this strong strain stiffening occurs when chains are long enough to entangle an average of about one chain each, which results in system-filling clusters of entangled chains. The number of entanglements is nearly proportional to the area surrounded by entangling particles with an excluded volume effect. A tendency was found for chain links to stretch when the packing was strained. The slope of the stress-strain relation of the packing can be calculated from a mean-field model consisting of the product of the effective extensional modulus of the chain, packing fraction, probability of stretched links, and the ratio of strain of stretched links to packing strain. The stress-strain model requires as input measurements of the ratio between local particle deformation and global average strain, and the probability of stretching for non-rigid particles. This results in a quadratic prediction for the stress-strain curve, with a curvature that agrees with experiments within the model uncertainties. This model explains that the strength of these packings comes from stretching of the links of chains, but only when the system-filling network of entanglements provides constraints that prevents failure by shear banding, so that particles must be deformed to move further under strain. In this model, the increasing slope of the stress-strain curve is mainly due to the fraction of stretched links increasing with strain. This model for the stress-strain relation is shown to be generalizable to different shapes of entangling particles by applying it to staples.</p>

            <h2>Quantum loops in the 1T transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashland Knowles, G. Baskaran, R. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Loop arrangements and their quantum superpositions describe several interesting many-particle states. We propose that they also describe bonding in a class of transition metal dichalcogenides. We present an effective quantum loop model for monolayers with 1T structure and a d$^2$ valence electron configuration: materials of the form MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te) and AM$'$Y$_2$ (A = Li, Na; M$'$ = V, Nb and Y = O, S, Se). Their t$_{2g}$ orbitals exhibit strongly directional overlaps between neighbouring atoms, favouring the formation of valence bonds. A transition metal atom forms two valence bonds, each with one of its neighbours. When connected, these bonds form loops that cover the triangular lattice. We construct a minimal Rokhsar-Kivelson-like model with resonance processes that cut and reconnect loops that run in proximity. The resulting dynamics is more constrained than in traditional quantum dimer models, with a `bending' constraint that arises from orbital structure. In the resulting phase diagram, we find phases that resemble distorted phases seen in materials, viz., the 1T$'$ and trimerized phases. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single d$^1$ or d$^3$ impurity will terminate a loop and give rise to a long-ranged texture. For example, a Ti/Cr defect in LiVO$_2$ will produce one or more domain walls that propagate outward from the impurity. We discuss the possibility of a loop liquid phase that can emerge in these materials.</p>

            <h2>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgia Marcelli, Tecla Bottinelli Montandon, Roya Ebrahimi Viand, Felix Höfling</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear optics lies at the heart of classical and quantum light generation. The invention of periodic poling revolutionized nonlinear optics and its commercial applications by enabling robust quasi-phase-matching in crystals such as lithium niobate. However, reaching useful frequency conversion efficiencies requires macroscopic dimensions, limiting further technology development and integration. Here we realize a periodically poled van der Waals semiconductor (3R-MoS$_2$). Due to its exceptional nonlinearity, we achieve macroscopic frequency conversion efficiency of 0.03% at the relevant telecom wavelength over a microscopic thickness of 3.4${\mu}$m (that is, 3 poling periods), $10-100\times$ thinner than current systems with similar performances. Due to unique intrinsic cavity effects, the thickness-dependent quasi-phase-matched second harmonic signal surpasses the usual quadratic enhancement by $50\%$. Further, we report the broadband generation of photon pairs at telecom wavelengths via quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion, showing a maximum coincidence-to-accidental-ratio of $638 \pm 75$. This work opens the new and unexplored field of phase-matched nonlinear optics with microscopic van der Waals crystals, unlocking applications that require simple, ultra-compact technologies such as on-chip entangled photon-pair sources for integrated quantum circuitry and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations in classical and quantum spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duyu Chen, Rhine Samajdar, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.</p>

            <p>Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.</p>

            <h2>Stark Shift from Quantum Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h2>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information applications, owing to their efficient and bright single photon emission. Despite the challenges in directly characterizing these emitters, the interaction between external fields and defects, such as the Stark shift, offers valuable insights into their local geometric configurations. In this study, we focus on clarifying the possible origin of the distinct Stark shift characteristics observed experimentally, particularly in the emission range around 2 eV. We find that the local symmetry of the defects plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the Stark shift, which can be either linear or quadratic. Additionally, the local dielectric environment significantly influences the Stark shift response. Our calculations not only enhance the understanding of the micro-structure of these hitherto unknown emitters but also pave the way for their more effective utilization as single-photon sources and qubits in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) dominate their optical response due to exceptionally large binding energies arising from their two-dimensional nature. Several theoretical models have been proposed to describe this excitonic behavior, however, it remains unclear which model most accurately captures the underlying physical properties of the response. In this work, we experimentally measure the optical response of high-quality monolayer TMD heterostructures and compare the results with the different theoretical models to address this uncertainty. We find that in high-quality heterostructures, quantum mechanical interactions in the form of pure dephasing plays a dominant role, which has been challenging to isolate experimentally in previous studies. Furthermore, accounting for an additional decay rate to the commonly used radiative and non-radiative rates is found to be important for the accurate description of the excitonic response. These findings establish a robust framework for understanding and predicting the optical properties of TMD-based heterostructures, crucial for both fundamental research and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</p>

We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</p>

            <p>Scalable solid-state quantum computers will require integration with analog and digital electronics. Efficiently simulating the quantum-classical electronic interface is hence of paramount importance. Here, we present Verilog-A compact models with a focus on quantum-dot-based systems, relevant to semiconductor- and Majorana-based quantum computing. Our models are capable of faithfully reproducing coherent quantum behavior within a standard electronic circuit simulator, enabling compromise-free co-simulation of hybrid quantum devices. In particular, we present results from co-simulations performed in Cadence Spectre, showcasing coherent quantum phenomena in circuits with both quantum and classical components using an industry-standard electronic design and automation tool. Our work paves the way for a new paradigm in the design of quantum systems, which leverages the many decades of development of electronic computer-aided design and automation tools in the semiconductor industry to now simulate and optimize quantum processing units, quantum-classical interfaces, and hybrid quantum-analog circuits.</p>

            <h2>Token-driven totally asymmetric simple exclusion process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bor Kavčič, Gašper Tkačik</p>
            <p>We consider a family of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs), consisting of particles on a lattice that require binding by a "token" in various physical configurations to advance over the lattice. Using a combination of theory and simulations, we address the following questions: (i) How token binding kinetics affects the current-density relation on the lattice; (ii) How this current-density relation depends on the scarcity of tokens; (iii) How tokens propagate the effects of the locally-imposed disorder (such as a slow site) over the entire lattice; (iv) How a shared pool of tokens couples concurrent TASEPs running on multiple lattices; (v) How our results translate to TASEPs with open boundaries that exchange particles with the reservoir. Since real particle motion (including in biological systems that inspired the standard TASEP model, e.g., protein synthesis or movement of molecular motors) is often catalyzed, regulated, actuated, or otherwise mediated, the token-driven TASEP dynamics analyzed in this paper should allow for a better understanding of real systems and enable a closer match between TASEP theory and experimental observations.</p>

            <h2>Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Albert M. Varonov</p>
            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</p>

            <p>The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental prerequisite of these exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity, nematic order, and checkerboard charge order. Here we explore the filling-dependent multiple stable intertwined electronic and atomic orders of flat-band state of 1T-TaS2 encompassing hole order, phase orders, coexisting left- and right-chiral orders and mixed phase/chiral orders via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Combining first-principles calculations, the emergent electronic/atomic orders can be attributed to the weakening of electron-electron correlations and stacking-dependent interlayer interactions. Moreover, achiral intermediate ring-like clusters and nematic charge density wave (CDW) states are successfully realized in intralayer chiral domain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions through chiral overlap configurations. Our study not only deepens the understanding of filling-dependent electronic/atomic orders in flat-band systems, but also offers perspectives for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <h2>Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in 2D Voronoi cell tissues with pulsating activity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-Qin Li, Qun-Li Lei, Yu-qiang Ma</p>
            <p>Cells not only can be motile by crawling but are also capable of non-motility active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayer.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide (BA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$ and phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide (PEA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$. By examining the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations, as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant correlations with the same. Additionally, we observed photoluminescence emission peak splitting for both systems, which becomes prominent above certain critical temperatures where the suppression of PLQY begins. This study suggests that the rotational motions of polarized molecules may lead to a reduction in exciton binding energy or the breaking of degeneracy in exciton binding energy levels, enhancing non-radiative recombination rates, and consequently reducing photoluminescence yield. These findings offer a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions in 2D HOIPs and could guide the design of more efficient light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.</p>

            <p>Discrete time crystalline phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of nonadiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which, surprisingly, is possible in nonergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required nonergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in nondisordered, nonintegrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</p>

            <h2>Motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Torben Sunkel, Lukas Hupe, Philip Bittihn</p>
            <p>Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</p>

            <p>Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the spin-charge current conversion characteristics of chemically disordered ferromagnetic single FePt thin films by spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance experiments performed on both a resonance cavity and on patterned devices. We clearly observe a self-induced signal in a single FePt layer. The sign of a single FePt spin pumping voltage signal is consistent with a typical bilayer with a positive spin Hall angle layer such as that of Pt on top of a ferromagnet (FM), substrate//FM/Pt. Structural analysis shows a strong composition gradient due to natural oxidation at both FePt interfaces, with the Si substrate and with the air. The FePt-thickness dependence of the self-induced charge current produced allowed us to obtain $\lambda _ \text{FePt}=(1.5\pm 0.1)$ nm and self-induced $\theta_ \text{self-FePt}=0.047 \pm 0.003$, with efficiency for reciprocal effects applications $\theta _ \text{self-FePt} \times \lambda _ \text{FePt} = 0.071$ nm which is comparable to that of Pt, $\theta _ \text{SH-Pt} \times \lambda _ \text{Pt} = 0.2$ nm. Moreover, by studying bilayer systems such as Si//FePt/Pt and Si//Pt//FePt we independently could extract the individual contributions of the external inverse spin Hall effect of Pt and the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect of FePt. Notably, this method gives consistent values of charge currents produced due to only self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in FePt layers. These results advance our understanding of spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms in composite thin films and pave the way for the development of next-generation spintronics devices based on self-torque.</p>

            <p>A simple three-dimensional model of a fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials as far as the intercluster structure is concerned.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuations of dynamical observables in linear diffusions with time delay: a Riccati-based approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.L. Rosinberg, G. Tarjus, T. Munakata</p>
            <p>Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <p>We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</p>

            <p>We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.</p>

            <p>Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a microscopic quantum theory that elucidates the nonlinear and nonperturbative optical response of biased bilayer graphene subjected to bichromatic strong laser fields. This response is analyzed using a four-band Hamiltonian derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations. For the laser-stimulated dynamics, we employ structure gauge-invariant evolutionary equations to accurately describe the evolution of the single-particle density matrix across the entire Brillouin zone. The resonant generation of electron-hole pairs by the high-frequency component of the field, combined with the induction of high-order harmonic generation and high-order wave mixing by the strong low-frequency field component, leads to significant alterations in the resulting spectra. These changes are driven by the effects of Berry curvature and the shift vector, which modify the relative contributions of interband and intraband channels, thereby fundamentally reshaping the radiation spectra at high-order frequency multiplication. The numerical results are further supported by approximate analytical calculations, demonstrating that high-order wave mixing can be modeled using the classical trajectory analysis of electron-hole pairs, with Berry curvature and the shift vector significantly influencing the saddle-point equations.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear field dependence of Hall effect and high-mobility multi-carrier transport in an altermagnet CrSb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqing Bai, Xinji Xiang, Shuang Pan, Shichao Zhang, Haifeng Chen Xi Chen, Zhida Han, Guizhou Xu, Feng Xu</p>
            <p>As a promising candidate for altermagnet, CrSb possesses a distinctive compensated spin split band structure that could bring groundbreaking concepts to the field of spintronics. In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. After careful analysis of the transport data, we conclude the non-linearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal, with the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have successfully reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.</p>

            <h2>Transverse voltage in anisotropic hydrodynamic conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaize Wang, Chunyu Guo, Philip J.W. Moll, Tobias Holder</p>
            <p>Weak momentum dissipation in ultra-clean metals gives rise to novel non-Ohmic current flow, including ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes. Recently, hydrodynamic flow has attracted intense interest because it presents a valuable window into the electronic correlations and the longest lived collective modes of quantum materials. However, diagnosing viscous flow is difficult as the macroscopic observables of ballistic and hydrodynamic transport such as the average current distribution can be deceptively similar, even if their respective microscopics deviate notably. Based on kinetic Boltzmann theory, here we propose to address this issue via the transverse channel voltage at zero magnetic field, which can efficiently detect hydrodynamic flow in a number of materials. To this end, we show that the transverse voltage is sensitive to the interplay between anisotropic fermiology and boundary scattering, resulting in a non-trivial behavior in narrow channels along crystalline low-symmetry directions. We discuss several materials where the channel-size dependent stress of the quantum fluid leads to a characteristic sign change of the transverse voltage as a new hallmark of the cross-over from the ballistic to the hydrodynamic regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</p>

            <h2>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon L. Annesi, Enrico M. Malatesta, Francesco Zamponi</p>
            <p>We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</p>

            <p>We previously reported the discovery of a two dimensional $^{4}$He supersolid; a state with intertwined density wave and superfluid order, observed in the second layer of $^{4}$He adsorbed on graphite. In this Letter we provide direct evidence for the density wave order, obtained by doping the layer with a small concentration of $^{3}$He atoms (impuritons). The heat capacity, magnetization and NMR relaxation times of the $^{3}$He were measured over a wide temperature range from 200 $\mu$K to 500 mK. They provide evidence for changes in the ground state in the second layer film as the amount of $^{4}$He is increased at various fixed $^{3}$He doses. Clear evidence is obtained for a solid second layer film, matching the r\a'egime of superfluid response previously observed in pure $^{4}$He films.</p>

            <p>Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Sekino, Yuya Ominato, Hiroyuki Tajima, Shun Uchino, Mamoru Matsuo</p>
            <p>We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Song Li, Pei Li, Adam Gali</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <h2>Inferring High-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>Maximum entropy methods, based on the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, are essential for modeling interactions between pairs of variables in data-driven problems across disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their considerable success, these methods typically fail to capture higher-order interactions that are often essential for understanding complex systems. Conversely, modern machine learning methods capture these complex interactions, but the computational cost of interpretable frameworks makes them impractical for real-world applications. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient way to capture statistical correlations using hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. In this study, we introduce a new method that maps RBMs to generalized Potts models, allowing for the extraction of interactions up to any specified order. This method utilizes large-$N$ approximations, enabled by the RBM's simple structure, to extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. Furthermore, we propose a robust framework for extracting higher-order interactions in more complex probabilistic models and a simple gauge-fixing method within the effective many-body Potts model. Our validation on synthetic datasets confirms the method's ability to recover two- and three-body interactions accurately. When applied to protein sequence data, the framework competently reconstructs protein contact maps and provides performance comparable to the best inverse Potts models. These findings confirm that RBMs are an effective and streamlined tool for exploring higher-order interactions within complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ezequiel E. Ferrero, Eduardo A. Jagla</p>
            <p>Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0<\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</p>

            <p>A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristina N. Kondrashova, Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya</p>
            <p>The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</p>

            <p>Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</p>

            <p>The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</p>

            <p>Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Pathak</p>
            <p>Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</p>

We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Time-dependent radiative heat flux after the beginning of thermal radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiryl Asheichyk</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts radiating at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts radiating, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux exhibits oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room- or higher-temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.</p>

            <p>The mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. Also, we have performed synchrotron-based high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the compressibility properties of this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, of three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine relative to terrestrial olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite. The origin of the observed differences is discussed. A simple model combining the results of both our nanoindentation and HP-XRD measurements allows us to describe the contribution of macroscopic and chemical-bond related effects, both of which are necessary to reproduce the observed elastic modulus softening. Such joint analysis of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue for characterizing these highly interesting materials.</p>

            <h2>Structural Changes and Percolation Transition in Networks after Aging Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
            <p>In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</p>

            <h2>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro</p>
            <p>Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</p>

            <h2>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lebedev-Stepanov</p>
            <p>The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski (HR) formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. In this paper, the Navier condition is applied to the liquid-liquid boundary for the first time. A generalized HR equation is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the usual HR equation. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids. For infinite viscosity of the drop, it becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip.</p>

            <h2>Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano</p>
            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <h2>Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting critical dynamics and vortex fluctuations in a high-temperature cuprate</h2>

            <p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p>

            <h2>Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kirmani, Benedikt Fauseweh, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</p>

            <h2>Pure momentum-shift bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric flat-band Mott insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuocheng Lu, Zhihao Gong, Jingshan Qi, Hua Wang, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>The shift current photovoltaic effect is conventionally understood as the real-space displacement of a wave packet induced by photoexcitation. However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field. Here, we developed a gauge-invariant method to decompose the shift current into real-space and momentum-space components. A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.</p>

            <p>While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</p>

            <p>Optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic phenomenon in the spin physics of semiconductors. Here, we investigate spin orientation in MAPbI3 lead halide perovskite crystals at the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K, where the material has an orthorhombic crystal structure. The recombination and spin dynamics of excitons and carriers are measured by time-resolved photoluminescence after circularly polarized excitation. The optical orientation of excitons reaches 85\%, which persists within their lifetime of 15-80 ps. This high orientation is maintained for excitation laser detunings from the exciton resonance to higher energies by up to 0.3 eV, then decreases and vanishes above 1.5 eV detuning. This indicates that the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism based on inversion symmetry breaking is inactive in MAPbI3 crystals with orthorhombic symmetry. The optical orientation of localized and spatially-separated electrons and holes results in 40\% circular polarization of their emission. Their contributions can be identified from the complex spin beats dynamics in transverse magnetic field. The dynamics analysis gives values of the Landé g-factors of 2.83 for electrons and 0.54 for holes. Also, the magnetic-field-induced polarization of excitons and carriers is analyzed in magnetic fields up to 6 T, showing that their spin relaxation times are longer than their lifetimes. Namely, for the excitons, the spin relaxation time exceeds the lifetime by a factor of 6. We model the dynamics of optical orientation degree for cumulative contributions of excitons and carriers and show that the exciton recombination dynamics can control these dynamics. The polarized emission of excitons and localized carriers, produced by their polarization on Zeeman-split levels in magnetic fields, is modeled.</p>

            <h2>Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad R. Hasyim, Arkajit Mandal, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</p>

Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</p>

            <p>In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Shahnazaryan, A. Kudlis, I. V. Tokatly</p>
            <p>We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{öh}lich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{öh}lich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to the specific dispersion of LO phonons, the polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <p>Graphene placed in a perpendicular magnetic field supports optical modes known as magnetoplasmons which are transversally confined to the graphene layer. Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dai Q. Ho, D. Quang To, Ruiqi Hu, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</p>

            <p>Within a homologous series of cuprate superconductors, variations in the stacking of CuO$_2$ layers influence the collective charge dynamics through the long-range Coulomb interactions. We use O $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to reveal plasmon excitations in the optimally-doped trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$. The observed plasmon exhibits nearly $q_z$-independent dispersion and a large excitation gap of approximately 300 meV. This mode is primarily ascribed to the $\omega_{-}$ mode, where the charge density on the outer CuO$_2$ sheets oscillates out of phase while the density in the inner sheet remains unaltered at $q_z=0$. The intensity of the acoustic $\omega_3$ mode is relatively weak and becomes vanishingly small near $(q_x, q_y)=(0, 0)$. This result highlights a qualitative change in the eigenmode of the dominant low-energy plasmon with the number of CuO$_2$ layers.</p>

            <p>In this letter, we demonstrate electric field-induced band modification of an asymmetrically twisted hBN/BLG/hBN supermoire lattice. Distinct from unaligned BLG/hBN systems, we observe regions in the density-displacement field (n-D) plane where the device conductance is independent of n and decreases as |D| increases. This distinction arises due to the angle asymmetry between the layers, which induces field-controlled layer polarization. We identify D-dependent additional band gaps near the charge neutrality point that appear in the conduction (valence) band for negative (positive) D values. In the quantum Hall regime, new 6-fold degenerate Landau levels are observed. Our findings establish that in an asymmetric supermoire heterostructure, an external vertical displacement field affects the valence and conduction bands very differently and sheds light on the asymmetric conductance patterns noted in previous studies.</p>

            <p>In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors doping is fixed during synthesis and the charge carrier density per CuO$_2$ plane cannot be easily tuned by conventional gating, unlike 2D materials. Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{on}}$ and the upper critical magnetic field $H_{c,2}$ in nanometer-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.</p>

            <h2>Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Selch, M.A.Zubkov, Souvik Pramanik, M.Lewkowicz</p>
            <p>We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern}. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling three types of fermions in a nodal ring topological semimetal through magneto-optical transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiwon Jeon, Taehyeok Kim, Jiho Jang, Hoil Kim, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Jun Sung Kim, Hongki Min, Eunjip Choi</p>
            <p>We investigate the quasiparticles of a single nodal ring semimetal SrAs$_3$ through axis-resolved magneto-optical measurements. We observe three types of Landau levels scaling as $\varepsilon \sim \sqrt{B}$, $\varepsilon \sim B^{2/3}$, and $\varepsilon \sim B$ that correspond to Dirac, semi-Dirac, and classical fermions, respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we identify the distinct origins of these three types of fermions present within the nodal ring. In particular, semi-Dirac fermions--a novel type of fermion that can give rise to a range of unique quantum phenomena--emerge from the endpoints of the nodal ring where the energy band disperses linearly along one direction and quadratically along the perpendicular direction, a feature not achievable in nodal point or line structures. The capacity of the nodal ring to simultaneously host multiple fermion types, including semi-Dirac fermions, establishes it as a valuable platform to expand the understanding of topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Light-matter correlations in Quantum Floquet engineering of cavity quantum materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beatriz Pérez-González, Gloria Platero, Álvaro Gómez-León</p>
            <p>Quantum Floquet engineering (QFE) seeks to generalize the control of quantum systems with classical external fields, widely known as Semi-Classical Floquet engineering (SCFE), to quantum fields. However, to faithfully capture the physics at arbitrary coupling, a gauge-invariant description of light-matter interaction in cavity-QED materials is required, which makes the Hamiltonian highly non-linear in photonic operators. We provide a non-perturbative truncation scheme of the Hamiltonian, which is valid or arbitrary coupling strength, and use it to investigate the role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in SCFE. We find that even in the high-frequency regime, light-matter correlations can be crucial, in particular for the topological properties of a system. As an example, we show that for a SSH chain coupled to a cavity, light-matter correlations break the original chiral symmetry of the chain, strongly affecting the robustness of its edge states. In addition, we show how light-matter correlations are imprinted in the photonic spectral function and discuss their relation with the topology of the bands.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a kind of collinear magnetism that is characterized by a momentum-dependent band and spin splitting without net magnetization, has recently attracted considerable interest. Finding altermagnetic materials with large splitting near the Fermi level necessarily requires three-dimensional k-space mapping. While this is crucial for spintronic applications and emergent phenomena, it remains challenging. Here, using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and model calculations, we uncover a large altermagnetic splitting, up to ~1.0 eV, near the Fermi level in CrSb. We verify its bulk-type g-wave altermagnetism through systematic three-dimensional k-space mapping, which unambiguously reveals the altermagnetic symmetry and associated nodal planes. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements further verify the spin polarizations of the split bands near Fermi level. Tight-binding model analysis indicates that the large altermagnetic splitting arises from strong third-nearest-neighbor hopping mediated by Sb ions. The large band/spin splitting near Fermi level in metallic CrSb, together with its high TN (up to 705 K) and simple spin configuration, paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena and spintronic applications based on altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Correlation Effects in a Simplified Bilayer Two-Orbital Hubbard Model at Half Filling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Jian Yang, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu</p>
            <p>Motivated by the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram and correlation effects using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a simplified bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model at half filling. Our results reveal the emergence of a nonmagnetic weakly insulating phase at weak on-site Hubbard interactions, transitioning to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase as the interaction strength exceeds a critical value $U/t_1^x\approx 4.15$. This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3) Heisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties such as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure factor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals results in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\gamma$ band, mirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient pressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the strong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <h2>The study of the energy spectrum of a system of quantum micro-vortices in a bounded spatial domain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.V. Talalov</p>
            <p>This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum, which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the context of the developed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhu Wang, Joe Huxford, Dung Xuan Nguyen, Guangyue Ji, Yong Baek Kim, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moiré systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or "spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a "guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Martin Müller, Michael Buchhold, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma>\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma<\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.</p>

            <p>Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion of neutral collective modes in partonic fractional quantum Hall states and its applications to paired states of composite fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram</p>
            <p>The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.</p>

            <h2>Effects of rotation on the thermodynamic properties of a quantum dot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luís Fernando C. Pereira, Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the effects of rotation on the physical properties of a quantum dot described by a radial potential and subjected to a rotating reference frame. The interplay between rotation and confinement is analyzed by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system, yielding energy levels and wavefunctions as functions of angular velocity. We compute key thermodynamic properties, including the density of states, magnetization, entropy, and heat capacity, in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that rotation induces significant modifications to the energy spectrum, removing degeneracies and generating oscillatory behaviors in magnetization akin to de Haas-van Alphen and Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an effect analogous to the magnetocaloric effect, where an increase in angular velocity leads to a decrease in temperature during adiabatic processes. These results reveal the potential of rotational effects to influence quantum systems and provide insights for future studies in mesoscopic physics.</p>

            <p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. We propose an optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser that leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane we invoke geometric frustration between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. Our optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.</p>

            <p>The multiband kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 exhibits complex orbital textures on the Fermi surface, making the orbital origins of its cascade of correlated electronic states and superconductivity a major scientific puzzle. Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states.</p>

            <p>This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</p>

            <p>The intertwining of magnetism with topology is known to give rise to exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the magnetotransport properties of NdAlSi, a magnetic Weyl semimetal that spontaneously breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries and hosts a large number of Weyl nodes. We observe a significant negative magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the chiral anomaly associated with multiple Weyl nodes. Remarkably, the extracted chiral coefficient reaches approximately $52~\mathrm{m\Omega}^{-1}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}~\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, larger than many other topological materials. Additionally, we observe an exotic anomalous Hall effect with an out-of-sync behavior, where the anomalous Hall resistance does not exactly follow the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that in conventional ferromagnets. These rich quantum transport phenomena, driven by the interplay between magnetism and Weyl nodes, establish NdAlSi as a prime platform for exploring the intricate topological behaviors of magnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p>We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</p>

            <p>Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</p>

            <p>Light sources and photodetectors operating in the far- to mid-infrared (FIR/MIR) band ($8$-$12~\rm \mu m$, $0.1$-$0.15~\rm eV$) remain relatively poorly developed compared to their counterparts operating in the visible and near-infrared ranges, despite extensive application potential for thermal imaging, standoff sensing, and other technologies. This is attributable in part to the lack of narrow-gap materials ($<0.1~\rm eV$) with high optical gain and absorption. In this work, a narrow-gap semiconductor, $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$, is demonstrated to exhibit an optical response $>10\times$ larger than that of $\rm Hg_{x}Cd_{1-x}Te$ (MCT), the dominant material for FIR/MIR photodetectors. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that chalcogen $p$ and metal $d$ band inversion in this material creates a Mexican hat band structure (MHBS), which results in a dramatic increase in the joint density of states at the optical transition edge compared to typical semiconductors. This prediction is experimentally validated here using single-crystal specimens of $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$ measured using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of $1.7$-$20~\rm \mu m$ ($0.73$-$0.062~\rm eV$). These measurements demonstrate a large enhancement in extinction coefficient and refractive index characteristic of a MHBS in the vicinity of the absorption edge, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The realization of topological semiconductors with a MHBS is expected to lead to high-efficiency detectors operating in the FIR/MID range.</p>

            <p>The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</h2>

            <p>P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.</p>

            <h2>Fermi-liquid corrections to the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of topological metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Pasqua, Michele Fabrizio</p>
            <p>We show that topological metals lacking time-reversal symmetry have an intrinsic non-quantized component of the anomalous Hall conductivity which is contributed not only by the Berry phase of quasiparticles on the Fermi surface, but also by Fermi-liquid corrections due to the residual interactions among quasiparticles, the Landau f-parametes. These corrections pair up with those that modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one, or the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of states. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for topological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological invariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such corrections are naturally accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory, here extended to the case in which coherence effects between bands crossing the chemical potential and those that are instead away from it play a crucial role, as in the anomalous Hall conductivity, and have important implications when those metals are on the verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.</p>

            <h2>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Ziye Zhu, Yuntian Liu, Zhenyu Zhang, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou</p>
            <p>Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</p>

            <h2>Single-particle spectral function of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Wilhelm Kadow, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provided evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description qualitatively captures our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moiré lattices.</p>

Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.</p>

            <h2>Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Maeda, Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Bo Lu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</p>

            <h2>Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyeong Ahn, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry by themselves eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</p>

            <p>CrSBr, a van der Waals material, stands out as an air-stable magnetic semiconductor with appealing intrinsic properties such as crystalline anisotropy, quasi-1D electronic characteristics, layer-dependent antiferromagnetism, and non-linear optical effects. In this study, we investigate the differences between the absorption and emission spectra, focusing on the origin of the emission peak near 1.7 eV observed in the photoluminescence spectrum of CrSBr. Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr. Lastly, we examine stimulated Raman scattering and calculate the Raman gain in CrSBr, which attains a value of 1 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm/GW, nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of previously studied three-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC) are two of the most famous macroscopic quantum phenomena. However, nature normally does not allow SC and FM to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2, and show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from neighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various other perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and topological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudip Malick, Hanna Świątek, Michał J Winiarski, Tomasz Klimczuk</p>
            <p>We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties with electronic band structure calculation of the Bi square net system PrAgBi$_2$. The magnetization and heat capacity data confirm the presence of a crystalline electric field (CEF) effect in PrAgBi$_2$. Analysis of the CEF effect using a multilevel energy scheme reveals that the ground state of PrAgBi$_2$ consists of five singlets and two doublets. The de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations data show a single frequency with a very small cyclotron effective mass of approximately 0.11 $m_e$. A nontrivial Berry phase is also observed from the quantum oscillations data. The magnetotransport data shows linear and unsaturated magnetoresistance, reaching up to 1060\% at 2 K and 9 T. Notably, there is a crossover from a weak-field quadratic dependence to a high-field linear dependence in the field-dependent magnetoresistance data. The crossover critical field $B^*$ follows the quadratic temperature dependence, indicating the existence of Dirac fermions. The band structure calculation shows several Dirac-like linear band dispersions near the Fermi level and a Dirac point close to the Fermi level, located at the Brillouin zone boundary. \textit{Ab inito} calculations allowed us to ascribe the observed dHvA oscillation frequency to a particular feature of the Fermi surface. Our study suggests layered PrAgBi$_2$ is a plausible candidate for hosting the CEF effect and Dirac fermion in the Bi square net.</p>

            <p>In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T$_c$s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher Tc should no longer solely be to increase T$_c$ under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$ (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~ 50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~ 4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.</p>

            <p>Transition metal oxides are a platform for exploring strain-engineered intriguing physical properties and developing spintronic or flexible electronic functionalities owing to strong coupling of spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides.</p>

            <p>Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been hindered by the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we show that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry known as the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. Furthermore, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</p>

            <p>The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows stepwise resistance dependencies on an applied magnetic field. These resistance steps result from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, exhibit unusual dependence on the magnitude of uniaxial strain $\epsilon$. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal -- strong topological insulator -- trivial dielectric and proves the appearance of the surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1\%$.</p>

            <p>Dielectric structures can support low-absorption optical modes, which are attractive for engineering light-matter interactions with excitonic resonances in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the coupling strength is often limited by the electromagnetic field being confined inside the dielectric, reducing spatial overlap with the active excitonic material. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for enhanced light-matter coupling by embedding excitonic tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) within dielectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), forming a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that optimizes the field overlap and alignment between excitons and optical waveguide modes. To tailor diffractive coupling between free-space light and the waveguide modes in the vdW heterostructure, we fabricate Fourier surfaces in the top hBN layer using thermal scanning-probe lithography and etching, producing sinusoidal topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. We observe the formation of exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting indicating that the system is at the onset of strong coupling. These results demonstrate the potential of Fourier-tailored vdW heterostructures for exploring advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba1-xKxBiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 > Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.</p>

            <p>We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 500 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-1}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism in orthorhombic $Pnma$ structure through group theory and DFT calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Rooj, Sugandha Saxena, Nirmal Ganguli</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetism, initially considered interesting but useless, recently emerged as one of the most promising magnetic phases for technology. Recently, a low symmetry antiferromagnetic phase, known as altermagnetic phase, have been discovered, where no time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is observed in spite of a vanishing net magnetization, leading to non-degenerate bands from the opposite magnetic sublattices. In this work, we consider two representatives of orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group, namely, BiFeO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ and find altermagnetic lowest energy phase in both from our density functional theory calculations. We find a substantial spin-splitting in both systems along a high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone without considering the spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Detailed features of the band dispersion obtained from our calculation confirm the lifting of sublattice spin degeneracy only in the $k_y$-$k_z$ plane while preserving the spin degeneracy in the other planes of the Brillouin zone. We provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the magnetic space group (MSG) to explain our DFT findings and an insightful symmetry-allowed model Hamiltonian, which qualitatively agrees with our results. Additionally, we extend our symmetry analysis to encompass two other potential MSGs within the $Pnma$ space group that may host the spin-splitting phenomenon without considering SOI and the likely form of their Hamiltonian. These detailed studies pave the way for a deeper understanding of the spin-splitting phenomena within the $Pnma$ space group, offering insights into the intricate interplay between symmetry and electronic as well as magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>Thermal Hall Effect of Magnons from Many-Body Skew Scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimos Chatzichrysafis, Alexander Mook</p>
            <p>We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon interactions in thermal Hall physics.</p>

            <h2>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Aguilera, Pablo A. Morales, Fernando E. Rosas, Hideaki Shimazaki</p>
            <p>Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva</p>
            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of Non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquids in noise magnetormetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Xiao, Masahiro O. Takahashi, Paul Stevenson, Satoshi Fujimoto, Arun Bansil</p>
            <p>Identification of isolated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is a key step towards the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Here we show how the $T_1$-based noise magnetormetry of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit can reveal the unique signatures of Majorana fermions attached to vacancies in a non-Abelian Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL). The $1/T_1$ of the NV center is found to be increased significantly when the working frequency of the NV center matches the energy difference between a MZM and a low-energy hybridized mode involving dangling Majorana fermions adjacent to vacancies. In experiments, this energy difference can be tuned by an external Zeeman field. Because of the large excitation gap of flipping a local $Z_2$ gauge field, the $1/T_1$ spectrum is robust against other fluctuations in KQSLs. Our study presents a promising pathway for identifying the non-Abelian phase in Kitaev materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harish P. Jain, Richard D.J.G. Ho, Luiza Angheluta</p>
            <p>T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</p>

            <p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p>

            <h2>Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling</h2>

            <p>Ab initio downfolding describes the electronic structure of materials within a low-energy subspace, often around the Fermi level. Typically starting from mean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and two-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian representing the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such Hamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated materials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab initio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range interactions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts for all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of the range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is readily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach to polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both short-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the magnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the static limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for MgO, and by 79% for GeTe. Our framework also predicts that overall attractive nearest-neighbor interactions arise between electrons in GeTe, consistent with superconductivity in this material.</p>

            <p>We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanyan Zhu, Eric Kleinherbers, Leonid Levitov, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</p>
            <p>In easy-plane magnets, the spin-superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin-superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID) -- inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of the electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency of the harmonic modes.</p>

            <p>When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Due to the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He</p>
            <p>Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This polarization arises from the momentum-dependent spin splitting, which is unique to altermagnets, and which induces a momentum-dependent optical intersite spin transfer effect. Furthermore, the ferrimagnetic polarization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. The excitation along the spin-polarized planes breaks the symmetry of the momentum-space magnetization distribution, leading to inequivalent spin-resolved charge transfer between sublattices across both momentum and real space. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferri-magnetic state.</p>

            <p>Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quintin N. Meier, Alberto Carta, Claude Ederer, Andrés Cano</p>
            <p>Altermagnets form a subclass of collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. Here, we introduce the Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including the perovskite SrCrO$_3$) as candidates for antiferromagnetic materials in which altermagnetism emerges from spontaneous orbital ordering, rather than crystal symmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we identify a layer-dependent spin splitting of the electronic states, driven by the interplay between spin and orbital order. We show that if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits a net spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe an anti-altermagnetic state where layerwise compensation leads to net zero spin splitting. We find that for odd $n$, altermagnetic and anti-altermagnetic phases can coexist, whereas for even $n$ and in the perovskite limit, the system remains strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, increasing $n$ favors metallicity. Finally, we indicate that in odd $n$ compounds, epitaxial strain can promote the altermagnetic phase.</p>

The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.</p>

Although the mean flow is essentially independent of the polydispersity, the motion of individual particles becomes more nonaffine on average for higher polydispersity samples. We characterize the nonaffine motion, finding a qualitative difference in the behavior of small and larger particles: the smaller disks have more nonaffine motion, induced by the larger particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bharath Hebbe Madhusudhana</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</p>

            <p>The aging sewer infrastructure in the U.S., covering 2.1 million kilometers, encounters increasing structural issues, resulting in around 75,000 yearly sanitary sewer overflows that present serious economic, environmental, and public health hazards. Conventional inspection techniques and deterministic models do not account for the unpredictable nature of sewer decline, whereas probabilistic methods depend on extensive historical data, which is frequently lacking or incomplete. This research intends to enhance predictive accuracy for the condition of sewer pipelines through machine learning models artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) by integrating factors such as pipe age, material, diameter, environmental influences, and PACP ratings. ANNs utilized ReLU activation functions and Adam optimization, whereas MLR applied regularization to address multicollinearity, with both models assessed through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. The findings indicated that ANNs surpassed MLR, attaining an R2 of 0.9066 compared to MLRs 0.8474, successfully modeling nonlinear relationships while preserving generalization. MLR, on the other hand, offered enhanced interpretability by pinpointing significant predictors such as residual buildup. As a result, pipeline degradation is driven by pipe length, age, and pipe diameter as key predictors, while depth, soil type, and segment show minimal influence in this analysis. Future studies ought to prioritize hybrid models that merge the accuracy of ANNs with the interpretability of MLR, incorporating advanced methods such as SHAP analysis and transfer learning to improve scalability in managing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability.</p>

            <h2>Resolving the Problem of Multiple Control Parameters in Optimized Borel-Type Summation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.I. Yukalov, S. Gluzman</p>
            <p>One of the most often used methods of summing divergent series in physics is the Borel-type summation with control parameters improving convergence, which are defined by some optimization conditions. The well known annoying problem in this procedure is the occurrence of multiple solutions for control parameters. We suggest a method for resolving this problem, based on the minimization of cost functional. Control parameters can be introduced by employing the Borel-Leroy or Mittag-Leffler transforms. Also, two novel transformations are proposed using fractional integrals and fractional derivatives. New cost functionals are advanced, based on lasso and ridge selection criteria, and their performance is studied for a number of models. The developed method is shown to provide good accuracy for the calculated quantities.</p>

            <p>We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category, which yields a fusion 2-category of codimension-1 and higher defects in a $2+1$D topological order. We apply the condensation completion to $2+1$D topological order with $\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_4$ fusion rules. In these cases, we explicitly enumerate the $1$d and $0$d defects present in these topological orders, along with their fusion rules. We also talk about other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can also find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</p>

            <p>Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) based on spin-1/2 fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) are considered on the square lattice. First, fPEPS approximants of Gutzwiller-projected Chern insulators (GPCI) are investigated by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques on finite size tori. We show that such fPEPS of finite bond dimension can correctly capture the topological properties of the chiral spin liquid, as the exact GPCI, with the correct topological ground state degeneracy on the torus. Further, more general fPEPS are considered and optimized (on the infinite plane) to describe the CSL phase of a chiral frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The chiral modes are computed on the edge of a semi-infinite cylinder (of finite circumference) and shown to follow the predictions from Conformal Field Theory. In contrast to their bosonic analogs the (optimized) fPEPS do not suffer from the replication of the chiral edge mode in the odd topological sector.</p>

            <p>Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures. In this study, we showcase the successful realization of the phase of \c{hi}_3 borophene on diverse substrates using aluminum-based chemical vapor deposition. Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</p>

            <p>In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical tree structures are common in many real-world systems, from tree roots and branches to neuronal dendrites and biologically inspired artificial neural networks, as well as in technological networks for organizing and searching complex datasets of high-dimensional patterns. Within the class of hierarchical self-organized systems, we investigate the interplay of structure and function, associated with the emergence of complex tree structures in disordered environments. Using an algorithm that creates and searches trees of real-world patterns, our work stands at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and network theory. We resolve the network properties over multiple phase transitions and across a continuity of scales, using the von Neumann entropy, its generalized susceptibility, and the recent definition of thermodynamic-like quantities, such as work, heat, and efficiency. We show that scale-invariance, i.e. power-law Laplacian spectral density, is a key feature to construct trees capable of combining fast information flow and sufficiently rich internal representation of information, enabling the system to achieve its functional task efficiently. Moreover, the complexity of the environmental conditions the system has adapted to is encoded in the value of the exponent of the power-law spectral density, inherently related to the network spectral dimension, and directly influencing the traits of those functionally efficient networks. Thereby, we provide a novel metric to estimate the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.</p>

The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).</p>

            <p>Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit unique properties, expanding opportunities in material design. We investigate MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) in homo- and heterobilayers with different stacking and twist angles. Twisted bilayers introduce Moiré patterns, significantly altering electronic properties. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap, highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree, 77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers yield symmetric Moiré patterns with tunable band gaps. Our findings emphasize that controlling heterostructures and twist angles is a powerful strategy for engineering electronic properties, offering a pathway for next-generation materials.</p>

Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations can be controlled by the drive. Our experiment paves the way for systematic real-time investigations of correlated electron transport in low-dimensional nanostructures.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Newtonian Deterministic Causality from Stochastic Motions in Continuous Space and Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing Miao, Hong Qian, Yong-Shi Wu</p>
            <p>Since Newton's time, deterministic causality has been considered a crucial prerequisite in any fundamental theory in physics. In contrast, the present work investigates stochastic dynamical models for motion in one spatial dimension, in which Newtonian mechanics becomes an emergent property: We present a coherent theory in which a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) emerges in a description of the evolution of entropy $-\phi(x,t)=\epsilon \log$(Probability) of a system under observation and in the limit of large information extent $\epsilon^{-1}$ in homogeneous space and time. The variable $\phi$ represents a non-random high-order statistical concept that is distinct from probability itself as $\epsilon=0$; the HJE embodies an emergent law of deterministic causality in continuous space and time with an Imaginary Scale symmetry $(t,x,\phi)\leftrightarrow (it,ix,-i\phi)$. $\phi(x,t)$ exhibits a nonlinear wave phenomenon with a mathematical singularity in finite time, overcoming which we introduce viscosity $\epsilon(\partial^2\phi/\partial x^2)$ and wave $i\epsilon(\partial^2 \phi/\partial x^2)$ perturbations, articulating dissipation and conservation, which break the Imaginary Scale symmetry: They lead to the Brownian motion and Schrödinger's equation of motion, respectively. Last but not least, Lagrange's action in classical mechanics acquires an entropic interpretation and Hamilton's principle is established.</p>

            <p>The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</p>

This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</p>

            <p>The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</p>

            <p>Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</p>

We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</p>

            <p>Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</p>

            <p>In contrast to their empirical counterparts, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) promise to deliver near-quantum accuracy over broad regions of configuration space. However, due to their generic functional forms and extreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties of novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set a determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme conditions. We propose a novel automated dataset generation method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the feature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the configuration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific target materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material properties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements with the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), graphite (C), and trigonal (Sb, Te) ground states. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a range of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very broad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or hyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to rapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for simulations in extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>Progress in miniaturized technology allows us to control physical systems at nanoscale with remarkable precision. Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control problems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent potential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a given time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle subject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects of inertia, and, building on the results of a previous work, provide a numerical method to find optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions, corresponding to non-harmonic confinements. The control protocol and the time-dependent position distribution are qualitatively different from the corresponding overdamped limit: in particular, a symmetry of the boundary conditions, which is preserved in the absence of inertia, turns out to be broken in the underdamped regime. We also show that the momentum mean tends to a constant value along the trajectory, except close to the boundary, while the evolution of the position mean and of the second moments is highly non-trivial. Our results also support that the lower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case is tight in the adiabatic limit.</p>

            <p>We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpiński gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpiński gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpiński gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</p>

            <h2>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</p>

            <p>Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.</p>

            <p>Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</p>

            <p>We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.</p>

            <p>Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By considering fermionic representations of our spin Hamiltonian, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky</p>
            <p>Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh</p>
            <p>Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs in two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels $(\sigma)$, packing fractions$(\phi)$, system sizes, particle size ratios$(\Delta)$, and amount of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of the FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Efstathios G. Charalampidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis</p>
            <p>We unravel the existence and stability properties of one-dimensional droplets arising in genuine two-component particle imbalanced bosonic mixtures under the influence of a weak harmonic confinement. A plethora of miscible droplet phases is found with the majority component atoms in the vicinity of the minority ones assembling in a droplet configuration while the remaining excess atoms being in the gas state. Our computations identify a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state for increasing total atom number and fixed interactions, with the bound character being prolonged for stronger intercomponent attractions. Spectral stability of these two-component droplets is revealed by examining their underlying Bogoliubov-de-Gennes excitation spectrum. Furthermore, the collective dynamics associated with the fundamental dipole and breathing modes of the system is monitored by suddenly shifting the trap's center or quenching the trap's frequency, respectively. There, a back action of the significantly localized minority component is imprinted in the majority cloud. The present findings can be simulated in recent cold-atom experiments, thus setting the stage for probing the complex nonequilibrium dynamics of two-component droplets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valla Fatemi, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck</p>
            <p>Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Mean-Field Theory for Continuous Random Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. A. Zúñiga-Galindo</p>
            <p>This article studies the dynamics of the mean-field approximation of continuous random networks. These networks are stochastic integrodifferential equations driven by Gaussian noise. The kernels in the integral operators are realizations of generalized Gaussian random variables. The equation controls the time evolution of a macroscopic state interpreted as neural activity, which depends on position and time. The position is an element of a measurable space. Such a network corresponds to a statistical field theory (STF) given by a momenta-generating functional. Discrete versions of the mentioned networks appeared in spin glasses and as models of artificial neural networks (NNs). Each of these discrete networks corresponds to a lattice SFT, where the action contains a finite number of neurons and two scalar fields for each neuron. In this article, we develop mathematically rigorous, continuous versions of the mean-field theory approximation and the double-copy system that allow us to derive a condition for the criticality of continuous stochastic networks via the largest Lyapunov exponent. We use two basic architectures; in the first one, the space of neurons is the real line, and then the neurons are organized in one layer; in the second one, the space of neurons is the p-adic line, and then the neurons are organized in an infinite, fractal, tree-like structure. We also studied a toy model of a continuous Gaussian network with a continuous phase transition. This behavior matches the critical brain hypothesis, which states that certain biological neuronal networks work near phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Poisson Point Process, Coulomb Gas, and Vortex Statistics</h2>

            <p>Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</p>

            <p>It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called the mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</p>

We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Behjatian, Ralf Blossey, Madhavi Krishnan</p>
            <p>Electrostatics in the solution phase is governed by free electrical charges such as ions, as well as by bound charges that arise when a polarizable medium responds to an applied field. In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length, but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.</p>

            <p>The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Li, Feng Xue, Xin-Yi Tang, Xiyu Hong, Yang Chen, Xiao Feng, Ke He</p>
            <p>Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.</p>

            <p>Moiré patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moiré patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moiré patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moiré patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moiré patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moiré patterns and facilitate the application of moiré patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</p>

            <p>We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonhyun Yeo, Haena Shim</p>
            <p>An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</p>

            <p>Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

            <h2>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vadym Apalkov, Wenchen Luo, Tapash Chakraborty</p>
            <p>We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases of {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov</p>
            <p>We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <p>Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behaviour of the architecture by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) architectures to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behaviour. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer architecture with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher, when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Crack tip plasticity originated in the metallic Ti layer in TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures increased the total fracture resistance by more than eight-fold compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.</p>

We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear shallow-water waves with vertical odd viscosity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Doak, Guido Baardink, Paul A Milewski, Anton Souslov</p>
            <p>The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist</p>
            <p>Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Dawid, Niccolò Bigagli, Daniel W. Savin, Sebastian Will</p>
            <p>One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</p>

            <h2>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Lorenzetti</p>
            <p>The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</p>

            <p>In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement. We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Neural Quantum State Study of Fracton Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Machaczek, Lode Pollet, Ke Liu</p>
            <p>Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh Q. Nguyen, Junxiang Huang, Dapeng Bi</p>
            <p>During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</p>

            <p>The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</p>

            <p>Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</p>

            <p>Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</p>

We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</p>

The computation of the gradient is necessary to specify the optimal protocol. Finally, we give an example application of the numerical techniques to solving an optimal control problem without spacial discretization using machine learning.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the time evolution of entanglement asymmetry of the black hole radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We assume the black hole is initially in a mixed state since it is entangled with the early radiation. Alice throws a diary maximally entangled with a reference system into the black hole. After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob tries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the black hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation emerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing entanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the thermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement asymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy and the size of the diary. What's more, when the initial state of the black hole is maximally mixed, this emergent symmetry survives during the whole procedure of the black hole radiation. We successfully explained this novel phenomenon using the decoupling inequality.</p>

This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a rigorous and systematic theory for statistics independent to topological order and field theory. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for computing statistics, which has yielded results consistent with traditional physical theories.</p>

            <h2>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics & Krylov Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyun-Sik Jeong, Arnab Kundu, Juan F. Pedraza</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Ayaka Sakata</p>
            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Higer, Yotam M. Y. Feldman, Barak Hirshberg</p>
            <p>We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Succi, M. Lauricella, A. Tiribocchi</p>
            <p>Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a dramatic reduction of friction due to the coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum-nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the wavelength of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena.</p>

            <p>While the periodic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) method promises systematic improvement of electronic band gap calculations in solids, its practical application at the singles and doubles level (EOM-CCSD) is hindered by severe finite-size errors in feasible simulation cells. We present a hybrid approach combining EOM-CCSD with the computationally efficient $GW$ approximation to estimate thermodynamic limit band gaps for several insulators and semiconductors. Our method substantially reduces required cell sizes while maintaining accuracy. Comparisons with experimental gaps and self-consistent $GW$ calculations reveal that deviations in EOM-CCSD predictions correlate with reduced single excitation character of the excited many-electron states. Our work not only provides a computationally tractable approach to EOM-CC calculations in solids but also reveals fundamental insights into the role of single excitations in electronic-structure theory.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Boesl, Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Phases with topological order exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: States with the same topological order are distinguished by how their anyonic excitations transform under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological phases. In this work, we develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune between wavefunctions of different symmetry fractionalization. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are completely immobile as individual particles. By deforming the local tensors that describe the ground state of the fixed point model, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions have non-vanishing correlation lengths and are non-stabilizer states. At the critical points between the phases, power-law correlations are supported in certain spatial directions. Furthermore, based on the isoTNS description of the wavefunction, we determine a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme for which a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays suffices to encode the three-dimensional state using measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order based on the language of tensor networks and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order with quantum processors.</p>

The unique properties of polar metals challenge expectations, making way for the exploration of exotic phenomena such as unconventional magnetism, hyperferroelectric multiferroicity and developing multifunctional devices that can leverage both the materials electric polarization and its asymmetry in the spin conductivity, that arises due to the Rashba effect. Here, via a high pressure single crystal diffraction study, we report the pressure-induced enhancement of polar distortions in such a metal, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our DFT calculations highlight that naive assumptions about the linear dependency between polar distortion amplitudes and the magnitude of the Rashba spin splitting may not be generally valid.</p>

            <p>Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel.

            <p>The interaction between intense light-matter not only promotes emerging applications in quantum and nonlinear optics but also facilitates changes in material properties. Plasmons can significantly enhance not only molecular chirality but also the coupling strength. In this study, we investigate the coupling dichroism in a strongly coupled chiral molecule-plasmonic nanoparticle system using RT-TDDFT. By simulating the interaction between L/D- Phenylglycinol molecules and chiral aluminum clusters (Na-doped Al197Na4), we examine the effects of molecular chirality, cluster chirality, and the coupled effect in the system. Our results demonstrate that the achiral/chiral clusters induce significant spectral shifts and enhance molecular CD signals due to strong plasmon-molecule coupling. The electric-field distribution and transition contribution maps (TCMs) reveal the formation of bonding and antibonding polaritonic modes, modulated by molecular proximity to the cluster. Both of the coupling factor and decay rate of the coupled system will be modulated by the chirality of the molecules and the cluster. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of coupled molecules leads to a substantial increase in the intensity of lower polaritonic modes, highlighting the collective behavior in multi-molecule systems due to the modal crosstalk or resonance between cluster chirality and molecular chirality. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing plasmon-enhanced chirality at the atomic scale, which have implications for the design of highly sensitive chiral sensors and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpit Arora, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>Time reversal symmetry breaking is an important piece in controlling nonreciprocal responses which are crucial in advancing the utility of quantum materials in device operations. Here, we propose cavity control of superconducting diode-like nonreciprocities where time reversal breaking is achieved via chirality of the cavity modes. With twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as an example, we demonstrate the general principles of cavity control of band dispersion and geometry using chiral microwave photons which are valid for modes in a split-ring resonator or for modes emulated on a qubit lattice. In particular, we show that time reversal breaking by chiral modes enables superconducting diode-like nonlinearities in TBG by valley polarized states and their skewed quantum geometry. Strikingly, we find sizeable nonreciprocities at par with those obtained in magnetic field trained TBG Jospephson junction devices. The cavity control of superconducting nonreciprocities offers non-invasive means of exploring new functionalities in quantum circuits with in-situ implementation. This can serve as an important contribution to the toolbox for nonreciprocal models in circuit quantum electrodynamics to be harnessed for quantum computing and sensing.</p>

            <p>The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</p>

Based on electron-hole bilayers made of MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures, here we study the behavior of excitonic insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. We report the observation of excitonic quantum oscillations in both Coulomb drag signals and electrical resistance at low to medium magnetic fields. Under a strong magnetic field, we identify multiple quantum phase transitions between the excitonic insulator phase and the bilayer quantum Hall insulator phase. These findings underscore the interplay between the electron-hole interactions and Landau level quantization that opens new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena in composite bosonic insulators.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, which emerges in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum coherence. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr, and encounters a sign change depending on the antiferro- and ferromagnetic ordering. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

Using an array of superconducting qubits, we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in Ref.

Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits.

            <p>Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Correlated topological materials often maintain a delicate balance among physical symmetries: many topological orders are symmetry protected, while most correlated phenomena arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is rare to find cases where symmetry breaking induces a non-trivial topological phase. Here, we present the discovery of such a phase in Ta2Pd3Te5, where Coulomb interactions form excitons, which condense below 100 K, opening a topological gap and creating a topological excitonic insulator. Our spectroscopy reveals the full spectral bulk gap stemming from exciton condensation. This excitonic insulator state spontaneously breaks mirror symmetries but involves a very weak structural coupling, as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy, thermodynamic measurements, and a detailed structural analysis. Notably, scanning tunneling microscopy uncovers gapless boundary modes in the bulk insulating phase. Their magnetic field response, together with theoretical modeling, suggests a topological origin. These observations establish Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first confirmed topological excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional crystal. This allows to access the associated physics through bulk-sensitive techniques. Furthermore, we uncover another surprising aspect of the topological excitonic insulator, a secondary excitonic instability near 5 K that breaks the translational symmetry. The wavevector of this state shows an unprecedented magnetic field tunability. Thus, we unveil a unique sequence of topological exciton condensations in a bulk crystal, offering new opportunities to study critical behavior and excitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Liu, James H. Cullen, Daniel P. Arovas, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>Evaluations of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) have only retained inter-band matrix elements of the position operator. Here we evaluate the OHE including all matrix elements of the position operator, including the technically challenging intra-band elements. We recover previous results and find quantum corrections due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity operators and inter-band matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum. The quantum corrections dominate the OHE responses of the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs and of massive Dirac fermions.</p>

            <h2>Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michiyasu Mori, Wataru Koshibae, Sadamichi Maekawa</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the bias current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is formulated under the bias current using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. The bias current shifts the Fermi momentum in the Rashba system due to the continuity of the electronic current. Including the shift of Fermi momentum in the coupling energy, it is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</p>
            <p>We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

            <h2>Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms</h2>

            <p>Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fröhlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mewael Isiet, Mauricio Ponga</p>
            <p>Spall failure, a complex failure mechanism driven by tensile stress wave interactions, has been extensively studied in single-crystal FCC metals, revealing a precursor stage involving dislocation emission along closed-packed directions. Here we investigate the photo-induced spall failure of Ni bicrystals under a two-pulse laser configuration, exploring various misorientation angles through two-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including electronic effects to simulate light-matter interaction. Our findings demonstrate that light-matter interactions can induce spall failure at the sample center, similar to conventional plate-impact methods, when two laser-pulses are applied to the front and back surfaces of the sample. The study reveals the significant influence of misorientation angles on dislocation activity and spall behavior, where grain boundaries (GBs) play pivotal roles, either promoting or impeding dislocation interactions. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential for enhancing spall resistance by tailoring materials through misorientation angle variation.</p>

            <h2>Spin-forbidden excitations in the magneto-optical spectra of CrI$_3$ tuned by covalency</h2>

            <p>Spin-forbidden ($\Delta S \neq 0$) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) CrI$_3$. Previously unreported spin-forbidden ($\Delta S = 1$) ${}^4A_{2\mathrm{g}} \to{}^2E_\mathrm{g}/{}^2T_{1\mathrm{g}}$ Cr${}^{3+}$ $dd$ excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr$^{3+}$ multiplet character is established through complementary Cr $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements along with charge transfer multiplet (CTM) calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series (CrX$_3$, X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit and exhibit a significant magnetic field tunability across the antiferromagnetic to FM transition in few-layer samples. This behavior is associated to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state, as supported by our CTM analysis. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI$_3$ and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field-tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of superconductivity on thin film of Sn under high pressure</h2>

            <p>We investigated the pressure effects of a superconductivity on thin films of Sn. Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with increasing pressure from 3.72 K to 5.3 K with the structural transformation into $\gamma$-Sn around 10 GPa. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.</p>

            <p>Quantized vortices in type-II superconductors provide insights into the mechanisms of superconductivity. However, the generation of antivortices, characterized by magnetization antiparallel to the external magnetic field, remains less understood. In this study, we investigate Sn-Pb solder, a superconductor with phase-separated Sn and Pb phases, and report the observation of both vortices and antivortices. Scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy revealed the presence of both vortices and antivortices, while magneto-optical imaging demonstrated flux avalanches. Our results demonstrate that Sn in Sn-Pb solder behaves as a type-II superconductor when magnetic fluxes are trapped, despite bulk Sn being a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature (TcSn) of 3.7 K. Our findings suggest that the size effect and proximity effect with Pb contribute synergistically to induce type-II superconductivity in Sn Notably, vortices were observed at temperatures as high as 5 K, exceeding the bulk TcSn. Furthermore, the interplay between the type-I superconducting Pb phase and the type-II superconducting Sn phase results in the generation of antivortices, providing a mechanism to accommodate excess magnetic flux. This study shed light on new research on composites combining type-I and type-II superconductors.</p>

            <p>Quantum matter phases may co-exist microscopically even when they display competing tendencies. A fundamental question is whether such a competition can be avoided through the elimination of one phase while the other one condenses into the ground state. Here, we present a high-resolution neutron spectroscopy study of the low-energy spin excitations in the high-temperature superconductor La1.855Sr0.145CuO4. In the normal state, we find low-energy magnetic fluctuations at incommensurate reciprocal lattice positions where spin-density-wave order emerges at lower Sr concentration or at high magnetic fields. While these spin excitations are largely suppressed by the emergence of the superconducting spin gap, some low-energy magnetic fluctuations persist deep inside the superconducting state. We interpret this result in terms of a dynamic competition between superconductivity and magnetism, where superconductivity impedes the condensation of low-energy magnetic fluctuations through the formation of magnetically-mediated Cooper pairs.</p>

            <p>Quantum oscillations in magnetization or resistivity are a defining feature of metals subject to an external magnetic field. The phenomenon is generally not expected in insulators without a Fermi surface. The observations of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulating materials have provided a rare counterexample and attracted much theoretical interest. However, the magnetic oscillations in correlated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations of resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in Coulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows the phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk materials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be comparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions between excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states are observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding energy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb drag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular momentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory calculations. The study demonstrates a new platform for studying quantum oscillations in correlated insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mustafa Saeed, Diya Batool, Muhammad Muzammil, Nomaan X</p>
            <p>We study the behavior of Ising spins on Euclidean spacetime backgrounds to determine which properties of the background - curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature - play a role in phase transitions. We construct Ising-like models on Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-Nördstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS) backgrounds. Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature - or Euclidean gravity - increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature.</p>

            <p>Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of charged scalar field against a charged black hole background and derives an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</p>

            <p>We propose a non-volatile memory element based on a lateral ferromagnetic Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane magnetization. The interplay between the latter and the intrinsic exchange field of the ferromagnet leads to a magnetoelectric effect that couples the charge current through the junction and its magnetization, such that by applying a current pulse the direction of the magnetic moment in F can be switched. The two memory states are encoded in the direction of the out-of-plane magnetization. With the aim to determine the optimal working temperature for the memory element, we explore the noise-induced effects on the averaged stationary magnetization by taking into account thermal fluctuations affecting both the Josephson phase and the magnetic moment dynamics. We investigate the switching process as a function of intrinsic parameters of the ferromagnet, such as the Gilbert damping and strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and proposed a non-destructive readout scheme based on a dc-SQUID. Additionally, we analyze a way to protect the memory state from external perturbations by voltage gating in systems with a both linear-in-momentum Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Brian Winkler, Marijan Beg, Martin Lang, Mathias Kläui, Hans Fangohr</p>
            <p>Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations, that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB) model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the -- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used to retain information [1].</p>

            <p>So-called fragile topological states of matter challenge our conventional notion of topology by lacking the robustness typically associated with topological protection, thereby displaying elusive manifestations that are difficult to harness for wave control. In this Letter, we leverage the recent discovery of fragile topological states in special classes of structural kagome lattices to document the availability of domain wall elastic wave modes that are directly traceable to fragile topology and, yet, exhibit remarkably strong signatures that support omni-directionality. We design twisted kagome bi-domains comprising two topologically distinct sublattices - one trivial and the other fragile topological - sharing a common bandgap and meeting at a domain wall. The two phases are achieved via carefully engineered surface cut patterns that modify the band landscape of the underlying lattices in complementary fashions, leading to dichotomous irreps landscapes. Under these circumstances, a domain wall-bound mode emerges within the shared bandgap and displays remarkable stability against domain wall orientation and introduced defects. We corroborate these findings via $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian and Jackiw-Rabbi analysis and validate them experimentally through laser vibrometry tests on a prototype endowed with water jet-induced perforation patterns.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <p>Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Taravati</p>
            <p>The pursuit of scalable and robust quantum computing necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the inherent challenges of qubit connectivity, decoherence, and susceptibility to noise and crosstalk. Conventional monochromatic qubit coupling architectures, constrained by nearest-neighbor interactions and limited algorithmic flexibility, exacerbate these issues, hindering the realization of practical large-scale quantum processors. In this work, we introduce a paradigm leveraging a space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurface to enable polychromatic qubit coupling. This metasurface facilitates frequency-selective interactions, transforming nearest-neighbor connectivity into all-to-all qubit interactions, while significantly enhancing coherence, noise robustness, and entanglement fidelity. Our proposed approach capitalizes on the unique capabilities of space-time-modulated Josephson metasurfaces, including dynamic four-dimensional wave manipulation, nonreciprocal state transmission, and state-frequency conversion, to mediate multi-frequency qubit interactions. By isolating qubit couplings into distinct spectral channels, the cryogenic-compatible metasurface mitigates crosstalk and environmental decoherence, extending coherence times and preserving quantum state fidelity. Full-wave simulations and quantum performance analyses demonstrate a significant enhancement in the operational efficiency of a superconducting qubit array, showcasing improved connectivity, robustness, and entanglement stability. This study establishes the potential of space-time-modulated cryogenic-compatible Josephson metasurfaces as a transformative platform for next-generation quantum computing, addressing critical bottlenecks and paving the way for scalable, high-performance quantum processors.</p>

At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.</p>

            <h2>Electrically tunable Floquet Weyl photon emission from Dirac semimetal Cd3As2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobhan Subhra Mishra, Thomas CaiWei Tan, Manoj Gupta, Faxian Xiu, Ranjan Singh</p>
            <p>The ability to optically engineer the Dirac band and electrically control the Fermi level in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac systems, such as graphene, has significantly advanced quantum technologies. However, similar tunability has remained elusive in three-dimensional Dirac systems. In this work, we demonstrate both optical and electrical tunability of the band structure in the 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Photoexcitation with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracy at Dirac points to transform the material into a Floquet Weyl semimetal with chiral Weyl nodes. This transition induces nonzero Berry curvature, giving rise to helicity-dependent transverse anomalous photocurrents, detectable through terahertz emission at normal incidence. Furthermore, applying an external electric field displaces the Fermi level away from the Dirac point, enlarging the Dirac cone projection leading to a reduced density of states of Fermi arcs. As a result, we achieve precise electrical control over Floquet band engineering, resulting in a large modulation of THz emission. Moreover, at oblique incidence, the circular photon-drag effect induces helicity-dependent longitudinal photocurrents. Simultaneous generation and manipulation of both longitudinal and transverse photocurrents enable precise control of the helicity of emitted THz pulses. These results pave the way for electric field-controlled Floquet Weyl THz sources, offering significant potential for applications in quantum computing and low-power electronics.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Logan Blackham, Arshath Manjalingal, Saeed R. Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal</p>
            <p>We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Tunable Giant Second-Harmonic Generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X=S, Se, Te)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhefeng Lou, Zhihao Gong, Ziye Zhu, Wenbin Li, Xiao Lin, Hua Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials with giant nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are essential for the development of advanced on-chip NLO devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D semiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of Bi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest values reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from gauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift vector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning drives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a polar metal. Our findings present a unique platform that combines strain-tunable bandgap engineering with exceptional NLO properties, while also highlighting the crucial role of quantum geometry in enhancing SHG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. M. Gordeeva, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, Tao Yu</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Bishnu Karki, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</p>

Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</p>

            <h2>Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Dupuis, Moksh Bhateja, Adam Rançon</p>
            <p>We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</p>

            <h2>Study on the SDW and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at ambient pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Bo Liu, Hongyi Sun, Ming Zhang, Qihang Liu, Wei-Qiang Chen, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory (DFT) band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector $Q\approx(0,0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From view in the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to $Q_0\approx(0.42\pi,0.42\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by FS-nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ considerably lower than that under high pressure, which is consistent with experiments. Furthermore, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC in the material.</p>

            <p>The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>A Micromechanical Model for Light-interactive Molecular Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devesh Tiwari, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna</p>
            <p>Molecular crystals respond to a light stimulus by bending, twisting, rolling, jumping, or other kinematic behaviors. These behaviors are known to be affected by, among others, the intensity of the incident light, the aspect ratios of crystal geometries, and the volume changes accompanying phase transformation. While these factors, individually, explain the increase in internal energy of the system and its subsequent minimization through macroscopic deformation, they do not fully explain the diversity of deformations observed in molecular crystals. Here, we propose a micromechanical model based on the Cauchy-Born rule and photoreaction theory to predict the macroscopic response in molecular crystals. By accounting for lattice geometry changes and microstructural patterns that emerge during phase transformation, we predict a range of deformations in a representative molecular crystal (salicylideneamine). Doing so, we find that the interplay between photoexcited states and the energy minimization pathways, across a multi-well energy landscape, is crucial to the bending and twisting deformations. We use our model to analyze the role of particle geometries and the intensity of incident light on macroscopic deformation, and identify geometric regimes for shearing and twisting deformations in salicylideneamine crystals. Our micromechanical model is general and can be adapted to predict photomechanical deformation in other molecular crystals undergoing a solid-to-solid phase change and has potential as a computational design tool to engineer reversible and controllable actuation in molecular crystals.</p>

This study investigates the catalytic potential of a dicalcium nitride (Ca2N) monolayer for hydrogen dissociation using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We find that atomic hydrogen preferentially adsorbs at Ca-centered hollow sites (labeled A sites), while molecular hydrogen adsorption is limited to bridge sites (labeled B sites). AIMD simulations reveal that H2 dissociation at B sites inhibits further adsorption, suggesting a mechanism of controlled H2 dissociation. The current findings emphasize the potential of pristine Ca2N as a catalyst for H2 dissociation-related processes and motivate future investigations of its activity in hydrogen evolution reactions.</p>

            <p>In this study, we present a first-principles investigation of the electronic and optical properties of gallium nitride (GaN) bilayers, focusing on the influence of interlayer sliding and spacing. In contrast to the earlier studies on discrete stacking configurations, we explore the dynamic evolution of the properties during transitions between stable stacking arrangements. Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically analyze the impact of these structural variations on the electronic band structure and optical absorption spectra of GaN bilayers. The analysis includes both high-symmetry stacking configurations (AA', AB', and AC') and intermediate states generated by controlled in-plane atomic displacements, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the property changes associated with interlayer sliding. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential for tuning the electronic and optical response of two-dimensional GaN for applications in nanoscale photonic and electronic devices, where precise control over interlayer interactions and stacking is crucial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrestha Dutta, Rudra Banerjee</p>
            <p>Hydrogen production via the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is critical for sustainable energy solutions, yet the reliance on expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts limits scalability. Zirconium-doped (\ce{Zr}-doped) MXenes, such as \ce{Ti3C2} and \ce{Ti3CN}, emerge as transformative alternatives, combining abundance, tunable electronic properties, and high catalytic potential. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we show that \ce{Zr} doping at 3\% and 7\% significantly enhances HER activity by reducing the work function to the optimal range of 3.5-4.5~eV and achieving near-zero Gibbs free energy (\dgh) values of 0.18-0.16~eV, conditions ideal for efficient hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Bader charge analysis reveals substantial charge redistribution with enhanced electron accumulation at \ce{Zr} and \ce{N} sites, further driving catalytic performance. This synergy between optimized electronic structure and catalytic properties establishes \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as cost-effective, high-performance alternatives to noble metals for HER. By combining exceptional catalytic efficiency with scalability, our work positions \ce{Zr}-doped MXenes as a breakthrough for green hydrogen production, offering a robust pathway toward renewable energy technologies and advancing the design of next-generation non-precious metal catalysts.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of a pronounced third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) in 1$T$-phase VSe$_2$ nanosheets, synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The nanosheets exhibit a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $\sim$77 K. Detailed angle-resolved and temperature-dependent measurements reveal a strong cubic relationship between the third-harmonic Hall voltage $V_{3\omega}^\perp$ and the bias current $I_\omega$, persisting up to room temperature. Notably, the third-order NLHE demonstrates a twofold angular dependence and significant enhancement below the CDW transition temperature, indicative of threefold symmetry breaking in the CDW phase. Scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic contribution from the Berry connection polarizability tensor is substantially increased in the CDW phase, while extrinsic effects dominate at higher temperatures. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDW-induced symmetry breaking in modulating quantum geometric properties and nonlinear transport phenomena in VSe$_2$, paving the way for future explorations in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate competition and cooperation of magnetic frustration and the Kondo effect in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on the square lattice at zero temperature. In this model, the frustrated interactions $J_1,J_2$ between the localized spins stabilize spin nematic orders, while the Kondo coupling favors local spin singlets. Using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small Kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. On the other hand, a standard Fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong Kondo interactions. Furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate Kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the Kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. We discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states.</p>

Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutan Zhang, Philip M. Dee, Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Thomas A. Maier, Steven Johnston, Richard Scalettar</p>
            <p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p>

            <p>We report the observation of Josephson diode effect (JDE) in hybrid devices made from semiconductor InAs nanosheets and superconductor Al contacts. By applying an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{xy}}$), we detect non-reciprocal superconducting switching current as well as non-reciprocal superconducting retrapping current. The strength of the JDE depends on the angle between the in-plane magnetic field and the bias current ($I_{\mathrm{b}}$), reaching its maximum when $B_{\mathrm{xy}} \perp I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and dropping to nearly zero when $B_{\mathrm{xy}}\parallel I_{\mathrm{b}}$. Additionally, the diode efficiency is tunable via an electrostatic gate with a complete suppression at certain gate voltages. Our findings indicate that the observed JDE in InAs nanosheet-based Josephson junctions most likely arises from the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the nanosheets. Such gate-tunable JDE in Josephson junctions made from semiconductor material with SOI is useful not only for constructing advanced superconducting electronics but also for detecting novel superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Tiwari, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.</p>

Herein, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using the group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers novel characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be further extended to other Floquet systems.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-aperiodic grain boundary phases in {\Sigma}5 tilt grain boundaries in refractory metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enze Chen, Timofey Frolov</p>
            <p>We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</p>

            <h2>The geometric impact of the quantum Hall interface on a cone</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Li, Qi Li, Zi-Xiang Hu</p>
            <p>Recently, quantum Hall interface has become a popular subject of research; distinct from that of the quantum Hall edge, which is constrained by external background confinement, the interface has the freedom to move, likely towards a string-like state. In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has an extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk. In this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall interface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more easily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the cone angle parameter $\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall interface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction. Moreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution to the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.</p>

            <h2>An ab initio dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity for advanced technology transistors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Xie, Ru Jia, Yonglin Xia, Lei Li, Yue Hu, Jiaxuan Xu, Yufei Sheng, Yuanyuan Wang, Hua Bao</p>
            <p>As the size of transistors shrinks and power density increases, thermal simulation has become an indispensable part of the device design procedure. However, existing works for advanced technology transistors use simplified empirical models to calculate effective thermal conductivity in the simulations. In this work, we present a dataset of size-dependent effective thermal conductivity with electron and phonon properties extracted from ab initio computations. Absolute in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity data of eight semiconducting materials (Si, Ge, GaN, AlN, 4H-SiC, GaAs, InAs, BAs) and four metallic materials (Al, W, TiN, Ti) with the characteristic length ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers have been provided. Besides the absolute value, normalized effective thermal conductivity is also given, in case it needs to be used with updated bulk thermal conductivity in the future. The dataset presented in this paper are openly available at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Magnon-mediated perpendicular magnetization switching by topological crystalline insulator SnTe with high spin Hall conductivity</h2>

            <p>Magnons possess the ability to transport spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials, a characteristic that sets them apart from traditional electronics where power consumption arises from the movement of electrons. However, the practical application of magnon devices demands room temperature operation and low switching power of perpendicular magnetization. Here we demonstrate the low-power manipulation of perpendicular magnetization via magnon torques in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB devices at room temperature. Topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits a high spin Hall conductivity of $\sigma_s \approx 6.1\times 10^4 (\hbar/2e)\cdot (\Omega \cdot m)^{-1}$, which facilitates the generation of magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator NiO. The magnon currents traverse the 20-nm-thick NiO layer and subsequently exert magnon torques on the adjacent ferromagnetic layer, leading to magnetization switching. Notably, we achieve a 22-fold reduction in power consumption in SnTe/NiO/CoFeB heterostructures compared to Bi2Te3/NiO/CoFeB control samples. Our findings establish the low-power perpendicular magnetization manipulation through magnon torques, significantly expanding the range of topological materials with practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Overdoping YBa2Cu3O7 via a heterostructure with La0.67Sr0.33MnO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankita Singh, Sawani Datta, Ram Prakash Pandeya, Srinivas C. Kandukuri, Mahesh Gokhale, Kalobaran Maiti</p>
            <p>YBa2Cu3Ox, the first superconductor discovered with Tc higher than 77 K, is among the most complex cuprates having both CuO chains and plains in the structure. YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) exhibits slightly overdoped behavior and further doping is difficult as all the lattice sites in the CuO chains are occupied. We have grown high quality single crystalline films of YBCO and bilayer La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/YBCO exhibiting superconductivity in both the cases. Photoemission spectra reveal different surface and bulk electronic structures; the difference reduces in the bilayer. Evidence of charge transfer across the bilayer interface is observed in the valence band and core level spectra indicating an overdoped condition in YBCO. While superconductivity in the presence of magnetic order in the bilayer is puzzling, this pathway to reach overdoped regime in YBCO opens up a new landscape to probe the exotic physics of unconventional superconductivity.</p>
