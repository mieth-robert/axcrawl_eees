            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm Interference in Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehyun Kim, Himanshu Dev, Amit Shaer, Ravi Kumar, Alexey Ilin, André Haug, Shelly Iskoz, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David F. Mross, Ady Stern, Yuval Ronen</p>
            <p>Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically-protected way. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments. In this work, we present the observation of coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures by employing the Fabry-Pérot interferometry (FPI) technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, $\Delta\Phi=2\Phi_0$, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of $\Delta\Phi=4\Phi_0$ may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge $e^* = \frac{1}{2}e$ or that interference of $e^* = \frac{1}{4}e$ quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Interestingly, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of $e^* = \frac{2}{3}e$ quasiparticles instead of $e^* = \frac{1}{3}e$. To probe statistical phase contributions, we operated the FPI with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the additional bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge $e^*=\frac{1}{4}e$, as expected for non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, flat bands and enhancement of superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture with a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the geometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for carriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector potential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects. This allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces quantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave pair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance superconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This exotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like resonances in the quasiparticle density of states.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Go Takeuchi, Mikio Eto</p>
            <p>Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double quantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead $L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$) is connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\varphi_{1}$ between leads $L$ and $R1$ and $\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned independently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction unless $\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of Andreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron interaction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms Dirac cones in the $\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the QDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost 30\% when $\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the presence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the superconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the minimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not show the SDE.</p>

            <h2>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das</p>
            <p>Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for understanding many-body effects and interactions between systems and measurements. A key challenge is identifying appropriate states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating phase space as a manifold, we embed real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equation in the phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence in momentum space, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We then apply the model to a square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT) to unravel a coexistence of nodeless $s_{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</p>

            <h2>An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihang Zhang, Yu He, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Rashba-Edelstein THz emission modulation induced by ferroelectricity in CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2//LiNbO3 systems</h2>

            <p>Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism Induced Topological Phase Transitions in Kane-Mele Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengtian Li, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the Néel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the Néel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.</p>

            <h2>An ab-initio study on engineering quantum anomalous Hall effect in compensated antiferromagnet MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Li, Yulei Han, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Transport in Interacting Spin Chains: Exact Derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto</p>
            <p>We theoretically study quantum spin transport in a one-dimensional folded XXZ model with an alternating domain-wall initial state via the Bethe ansatz technique, exactly demonstrating that a probability distribution of finding a left-most up-spin with an appropriate scaling variable converges to the Tracy-Widom distribution for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which is a universal distribution for the largest eigenvalue of GUE under a soft-edge scaling limit. Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Hofstadter cascade in a twisted semiconductor homobilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Foutty, Aidan P. Reddy, Carlos R. Kometter, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Trithep Devakul, Benjamin E. Feldman</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide moiré homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moiré potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moiré effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.</p>

            <h2>Designing Spin-driven Multiferroics in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranquan Cao, Ruizhi Dong, Ruixiang Fei, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</p>

            <h2>Chemical Compositions of Soot Samples in Gold Electrode Capacitors: Molecular Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda A. Andreeva</p>
            <p>Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP > PC > PET > PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Method to Transform Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules into Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingzhi Chen, Kunpeng Tang, Wendi Zhang, Huiju Cao, Hongwei Zhang, Yanghao Feng, Weili Cui, Yuan Hu, Lei Shi, Guowei Yang</p>
            <p>Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Insulator and Electrode Materials Marginally Influence Carbonized Layer Conductivity in Metalized-Film Capacitors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda Andreeva</p>
            <p>Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals with neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Qing Shi, Hai-Qing Zhang</p>
            <p>Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional second-order topological insulator exhibits topologically protected zero-energy states at its corners. In the literature, the breathing kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example of a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator. Here we show by explicit construction that the corner states of the breathing kagome lattice can be removed by a continuous change of the hopping parameters, without breaking any of the model's symmetries, without closing bulk and boundary gaps, and without introducing hopping terms not present in the original model. Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.</p>

            <p>Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Under external stimuli, lead halide perovskites exhibit large atomic fluctuations, impacting optical and electron transport properties that affect device performance in operational settings. However, a thorough understanding of the atomic basis for the underlying structural instability is still absent. Focusing on the model material CsPbBr$_3$, the inherent lattice softness of halide perovskites is elucidated at the atomic level through in-situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure complemented by atomic level simulations. We identify and explore the nature of the first-order phase transition to a distorted P21/c phase at 1.3 GPa, induced by the sudden Cs-Br bonds breaking. Unlike classical transition metal oxide perovskites, where the internal energy term dominates, we show explicitly that pressure primarily influences the Gibbs free energy for halide perovskites through the pressure-volume term. As such, strategically mitigating bond strains from volume shrinkage is the key to suppressing the first-order behavior for maintaining the coordinates of PbX$_6$ polyhedral upon external perturbation. Our thermodynamic calculation reveals the demand for high entropy in the -T*del-S term, which can be achieved by exploring a broader spectrum of doped A site and B sites in ABX$_3$ systems, enabling continuous structural changes that facilitate recovery from mechanical damage in practical applications.</p>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França</p>
            <p>We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Solano, Quentin Rossi, Jerome Robert, Marc Lenertz, Yves Henry, Benoit Gobaut, David Halley, Mattieu Bailleul</p>
            <p>An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</p>

            <h2>Mott and Wiedemann Franz Law for Monolayer Graphene for Different Scattering Mechanisms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Purnendu Ray, Kingshuk Sarkar</p>
            <p>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of the thermoelectric responses exhibited by monolayer pristine graphene in response to temperature variations. Employing the Boltzmann transport theory, we rigorously examined and evaluated various thermoelectric coefficients, with particular emphasis on elucidating their behavior under different scattering mechanisms. We derived the analytical expressions for electrical conductivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity at low temperatures by Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi integral. We demonstrated that our numerically obtained values are consistent with the analytical calculations at low temperatures and hence obeying Mott and Wiedeman Franz law. However, the deviation was observed at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we performed theoretical calculations of chemical potential at both low and high temperatures and compared them with our numerically evaluated results at all temperatures. Through extensive calculations and meticulous evaluation, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate thermoelectric properties inherent in monolayer pristine graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonu Karayat, Prashant K. Purohit, L. Mahadevan, Arvind Gopinath, Raghunath Chelakkot</p>
            <p>We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped spatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of equally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free at the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with activity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament backbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence length. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that the filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced, kinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry, elasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size, shape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for different grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with activity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that relate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters, to filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of clustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active forces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations suggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar self-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic microtubule-motor systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenqi Meng, Xinping Yang, Tian Lan, Zhengcheng Gu</p>
            <p>We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</p>

            <p>In the present investigation, the chemical leaching of the poly-grain Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloy have been studied. The polished surfaces of as-cast alloys were leached with 10 mole NaOH solution for 0.5- 8 hours. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques have been used for structural and microstructural characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis has been carried out for chemical composition analysis. Chemical leaching exclusively removes the Al from the surfaces of the Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, consequently by the formation of porous structure containing nano size particles of Cu, Co and their oxides have been observed. Al65Cu15Co20 exhibits high porosity in comparison to Al65Cu20Co15 alloy, however the size of the precipitated nano-particles i.e. Cu, Co, Cu2O and CuO were smaller in the case of Al65Cu20Co15 alloy. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis mapping suggests homogeneous distribution of Cu and Co found on the leached surface and the presence of oxygen was also detected.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Paquin-Lefebvre, Alejandro Barea Moreno, David Holcman</p>
            <p>Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.</p>

            <h2>Crossover of Critical Behavior in Dynamic Phase Transitions of Ferromagnetic Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erol Vatansever, Mikel Quintana, Andreas Berger</p>
            <p>We investigate the crossover of critical behavior for the dynamic phase transition (DPT) in ferromagnetic thin films using Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising model, focusing on the scaling behavior of the dynamic order parameter under a time-dependent external magnetic field. Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>External field induced metal-to-insulator transition in dissipative Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beomjoon Goh, Junwon Kim, Hongchul Choi, Ji Hoon Shim</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a non-equilibrium steady-state non-crossing approximation (NESS-NCA) impurity solver applicable to general impurity problems. The choice of the NCA as the impurity solver enables both a more accurate description of correlation effects with larger Coulomb interaction and scalability to multi-orbital systems. Based on this development, we investigate strongly correlated non-equilibrium states of a dissipative lattice system under constant electric fields. Both the electronic Coulomb interaction and the electric field are treated non-perturbatively using dynamical mean-field theory in its non-equilibrium steady-state form (NESS-DMFT) with the NESS-NCA impurity solver. We validate our implementation using a half-filled single-band Hubbard model attached to a fictitious free Fermion reservoir, which prevents temperature divergence. As a result, we identify metallic and insulating phases as functions of the electric field and the Coulomb interaction along with a phase coexistence region amid the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). We find that the MIT driven by the electric field is qualitatively similar to the equilibrium MIT as a function of temperature, differing from results in previous studies using the iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver. Finally, we highlight the importance of the morphology of a correlated system under the influence of an electric field.</p>

            <p>We investigate a quantum dot (QD) system coupled to a vibrational environment with a super-Ohmic spectral density and weakly to a leaky cavity mode, a model relevant for semiconductor-based single-photon sources. The phonon coupling induces dephasing and broadens the absorption and emission line shapes, while the weakly coupled cavity mode leads to effective driving of the QD. To capture non-Markovian effects, we use non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and its hierarchical extension the Hierarchy of Pure States to compute multitime correlation functions underlying absorption and resonance fluorescence spectra. We present numerical results for the absorption spectra at strong phonon coupling and finite temperature, as well as for resonance fluorescence spectra at varying phonon coupling strengths and temperatures, and analyse the visibility of the resonance fluorescence spectra to provide insights into how phonon coupling and thermal effects influence the spectral features.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic transition of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model: multi-particles and inter-particle interaction effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu</p>
            <p>How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Atomic layer etching of SiO2 using sequential SF6 gas and Ar plasma</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Peng, Rakshith Venugopal, Robert Blick, Robert Zierold</p>
            <p>In the relentless pursuit of advancing semiconductor technologies, the demand for atomic layer processes has given rise to innovative processes, which have already played a significant role in the continued miniaturization features. Among these, atomic layer etching (ALE) is gaining increasing attention, offering precise control over material removal at the atomic level. Despite some thermal ALE achieved sub-nm etching controllability, the currently practical ALE processes that involve plasmas steps often suffer from high etch rates due to the scarcity of highly synergistic ALE half-reactions. To overcome this limitation, we developed an ALE process of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on a silicon wafer using sequential pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas exposure and argon (Ar) plasma etching near room temperature, achieving a stable and consistent etching rate of approximately 1.4 Å/cycle. In this process, neither of the two half-cycle reactions alone produces etching effects, and etching only occurs when the two are repeated in sequence, which means a 100% synergy. The identification of temperature and plasma power windows further substantiates the high synergy of our ALE process. Moreover, detailed morphology characterization over multiple cycles reveals a directional etching effect. This study provides a reliable, reproducible, and highly controllable ALE process for SiO2 etching, which is promising for nanofabrication processes.</p>

            <p>When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. In the adiabatic limit of a massive object, we derive the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, with odd diffusion and odd mobility connected by an Einstein relation, and numerically explore the breakdown of these predictions beyond the adiabatic limit. We show that the irreversibility of a massive object increases as its symmetry decreases: a disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully out of equilibrium. Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in the universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</p>

We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</p>

            <p>We explore, through a combination of x-ray diffraction and elastoresistivity measurements, the effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave and associated multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.026). We focus particularly on the behavior near the strain-tuned bicritical point that occurs in pristine ErTe$_3$ (x=0). Our study reveals that while Pd intercalation somewhat broadens the signatures of the CDW phase transitions, the line of first-order transitions at which the CDW reorients as a function of applied strain persists in the presence of disorder and still seemingly terminates at a critical point. The critical point occurs at a lower temperature and a lower strain compared to pristine ErTe$_3$. Similarly, the nematic elastoresistance of Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$, though suppressed in magnitude and broadened relative to that of ErTe$_3$, has a markedly more symmetric response around the critical point. These observations point to disorder driving a reduction in the system's electronic orthorhombicity even while the material remains irrevocably orthorhombic due to the presence of a glide plane in the crystal structure. Disorder, it would appear, reinforces the emergence of a "pseudo-tetragonal" electronic response in this fundamentally orthorhombic material.</p>

We use Luttinger-Tisza, classical mean-field, and random-phase approximation techniques to model the dispersive crystal field excitons. We find extended-ranged and sign-changing interactions, suggesting a coupling between conduction electrons and the local moments. We demonstrate that low-symmetry anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in contrast with higher-symmetry interactions enabled by Weyl fermions, play an important role in stabilizing the complex spin spiral ground state of NdAlSi. Our work provides a first detailed view of microscopic interactions in a Weyl magnet, and constrains the role of Weyl electrons and their chirality on the spiral magnetism.</p>

            <p>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the Néel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.</p>

            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <p>The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits</p>
            <p>The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Xu, Tingzhang Shi, H. T. Quan</p>
            <p>In previous studies of relativistic thermodynamics, the temperature of a static system, as perceived by a moving observer, has traditionally been treated as a scalar. This assumption has also been extended to the research on the cosmic microwave background. However, the validity of this assumption is a consequence of the massless nature of photons. More generally, when an observer is in relative motion to a system, the thermal equilibrium state is characterized by a four-vector temperature. In this paper, we study the non-interacting massive Bosonic and Fermionic field systems. We derive the Lorentz transformation of the energy spectral density in the equilibrium state of these fields. In the massless limit for bosonic field, our results recover the transformation of black body radiation [G. W. Ford and R. F. O' Connell., Phys. Rev. E, 88, 044101(2013)], which corresponds to a scalar temperature with dipole anisotropy. For the massive fields, the moving equilibrium state cannot be characterized by a corresponding scalar temperature. This result shows the necessity of introducing four-vector temperature in relativistic thermodynamics.</p>

The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-Mézard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.</p>

            <h2>High-pressure growth effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide superconductors</h2>

            <p>High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuotao Xie, Yu-Feng Song, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half-filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations, and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half-filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J. Calderón, A. Camjayi, A. Datta, E. Bascones</p>
            <p>Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</p>

The connection of the trimeron arrangement with site-selective doping of magnetite is discussed.

            <h2>Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.</p>

            <p>Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.</p>

            <p>Weinvestigate the topological phase transition of Kitaev spin liquid in an external magnetic field by calculating the Berry curvature and the Fubini-Study metric. Employing Jordan-Wigner transformation and effective perturbative theory to transform the Hamiltonian into fermionic quadratic form, the Berry curvature is calculated by choosing the effective magnetic field as the parameter, and we find that the xy-component of the Berry curvature has the same behavior around the critical lines with the phase diagram and the behavior of Berry curvature around the critical line will not be influenced by local perturbation, i.e. it has the robustness against the local perturbation. Especially, we relate the Berry curvature with the derivative of effective magnetic susceptibility which can be regarded as the signature of topological phase transition besides, we related the second nonlinear susceptibility with the non-Abelian Berry connection. Then we analytically calculate the generalized Berry curvature in the mixed state called mean Uhlmann curvature which can be related with the spectral function, the curves that mean Uhlmanncurvaturechangingtemperaturewithdifferentcouplingconstant reveal that it will have an extrema when adjust $J_x$ from $A$ phase to $B$ phase. At last we analytically calculate the quantum geometric tensor in the effective magnetic field space whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and real part is the Fubini-Study metric, and we find that the zz-component of Fubini-Study metric and the phase diagram are highly correlated which will peak at the cross point of three phases, then the Fubini-Study metric is extended to the finite temperature with arising an additional term called Fisher-Rao metric caused by mixed state.</p>

            <h2>The global critical current effect of superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng Wu, Yaojia Wang, Mazhar N. Ali</p>
            <p>Superconductivity has been investigated for over a century, but there are still open questions about what determines the critical current; the maximum current a superconductor can carry before switching to its normal state. For a given superconductor, the zero-field critical current is widely believed to be determined by its inherent properties and be related to its critical magnetic field. Here, by studying superconducting polycrystalline films, single crystal flakes, and layered heterostructures, we find that the critical current of a superconductor can vary with measurement configuration. It can be influenced, or even determined, by adjacent superconducting segments along the applied current trajectory, whereas the critical magnetic field and critical temperature remain unaffected. This global critical current effect both reveals the need to revisit fundamental theory describing superconductivity, as well as implies that superconductors can transfer critical current related properties to each other. We demonstrate this by designing and fabricating a simple superconducting structure that transferred a superconducting diode effect from one segment to another segment which could not manifest the effect on its own. This observation merits a reconsideration of contemporary superconducting circuit design, and developing a full understanding will lead to a new paradigm of superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.</p>

We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</p>

            <p>The long sought cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen (cg-N) consisting of N-N single bonds has been synthesized by a simple route using sodium azide as a precursor at ambient conditions. The recrystallization process was designed to expose crystal faces with low activation energy that facilitates initiating the polymeric reaction at ambient conditions. The azide was considered as a precursor due to the low energy barrier in transforming double bonded N=N to single bonded cg-N. Raman spectrum measurements detected the emerging vibron peaks at 635 cm-1 for the polymerized sodium azide samples, demonstrating the formation of cg-N with N-N single bonds. Different from traditional high pressure technique and recently developed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, the route achieves the quantitative synthesis of cg-N at ambient conditions. The simple method to synthesize cg-N offers potential for further scale up production as well as practical applications of polymeric nitrogen based materials as high energy density materials.</p>

            <p>The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)2 layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.

Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to full dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by short-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit dislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the presence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface studied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces investigated in our previous work.</p>

Our measurements unveil highly anisotropic magnetic excitations in momentum space. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of various models that incorporate diverse symmetry-allowed magnetic interactions, we find the observed excitations are well captured by a model with a large bond-dependent Kitaev interaction. These results not only help to understand the intriguing properties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and strong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue for exploring Kitaev physics.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials phase reconstruction from Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements has traditionally been achieved using longstanding methods such as off-axis holography (OAH) and the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). Amidst the increase in access to processing power and the development of advanced algorithms, phase retrieval of nanoscale magnetic materials with higher fidelity and resolution, potentially down to the few nanometer limit, becomes possible. Specifically, reverse-mode automatic differentiation (RMAD) and the extended electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) are two methods that have been utilized for high confidence phase reconstructions using LTEM through-focal series imaging and Lorentz scanning TEM (Ltz-4D-STEM), respectively. This work evaluates phase retrieval using TIE, RMAD, and ePIE in simulations consisting of an array of Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanoscale islands. Extending beyond simulations, we demonstrate total phase reconstructions of a NiFe nanowire using OAH and RMAD in LTEM and ePIE in Ltz-4D-STEM experiments and determine the magnetization saturation through corroborations with micromagnetic simulations. Finally, we show how the total phase shift gradient can be utilized to observe and characterize the proximity effects emanating from neighboring magnetic island interactions and an isolated NiFe nanowire.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the high temperature superconductivity observed in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the spectroscopic evidences of strong electron correlations in this compound, we address the role of its multiorbital electron correlations by proposing a global phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. We find a Mott transition developing at half filling, and identify strong orbital selectivity when the system is at the physical electron count. The orbital selectivity is manifested in the formation of interlayer spin singlets between electrons in the $z^2$ orbitals. These features lead to a strong renormalization of the electronic band structure while sustaining a sizable splitting between the bonding and antibonding $z^2$ bands. The proposed orbital-selective correlations naturally explain a series of features as observed in the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical conductivity measurements in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results provide a basis to understand both the normal state and the high temperature superconductivity of multilayer nickelates and thereby elucidate correlated superconductivity in general.</p>

Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings offer insights applicable to a broad class of extended classical interacting systems.</p>

We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect.

            <p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect arises from strong electron correlations in a quantising magnetic field, and features exotic emergent phenomena such as electron fractionalisation. Using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach with the combinatorial summation algorithm, we obtain results with controlled accuracy for the microscopic model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level. As the temperature is lowered, we study the development and emergence of the incompressible 1/3-filled FQH state. By analysing the long-time decay of the Green's function, we find spectral properties consistent with an energy gap near 1/3-filling, while at half-filling an anomalous power law scaling is observed for short-range interaction screening, indicative of a non-Fermi liquid metal. Our work provides the first demonstration that fractionalised phases of matter can be reliably described with Feynman's diagrammatic technique in terms of the fundamental electronic degrees of freedom, while also showing applicability of expansions in the bare Coulomb potential for precision calculations.</p>

            <p>The phase ordering kinetics of emergent orders in correlated electron systems is a fundamental topic in non-equilibrium physics, yet it remains largely unexplored. The intricate interplay between quasiparticles and emergent order-parameter fields could lead to unusual coarsening dynamics that is beyond the standard theories.

Here we leverage modern machine learning (ML) methods to achieve a linear-scaling algorithm for simulating the coarsening of charge density waves (CDWs), one of the fundamental symmetry breaking phases in functional electron materials. We demonstrate our approach on the square-lattice Hubbard-Holstein model and uncover an intriguing enhancement of CDW coarsening which is related to the screening of on-site potential by electron-electron interactions. Our study provides fresh insights into the role of electron correlations in non-equilibrium dynamics and underscores the promise of ML force-field approaches for advancing multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</p>

We use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its use in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a substrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be lattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We also evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the polarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to pseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the results for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure compounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides. Our results provide guidance for the development of electronic devices based on wz-LaN.</p>

            <p>Sr-doped nickelate, Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (NSNO), perovskite thin films and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases are actively investigated because of their physical properties, such as the metal-insulator transition and superconductivity. However, achieving epitaxial growth of NSNO perovskite and RP phase films in a sputtering system is challenging compared to pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, due to the difficulty in stabilizing nickel oxidation states and minimizing structural defects. Here, we used an off-axis radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to fabricate epitaxial NSNO perovskite and RP phase thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates, systematically controlling the growth temperatures. We investigated the thermal stability of the perovskite phase and the structural and electronic characteristics of the RP phase films. These findings provide valuable insights into the synthesis of nickelate RP phase films using RF magnetron sputtering, paving the way for scalable thin films fabrication technologies.</p>

            <h2>Z$_2$ topological orders in kagom\'e dipolar systems: Feedback from Rydberg quantum simulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Gang v. Chen</p>
            <p>The mutual feedback between quantum condensed matter and cold atom physics has been quite fruitful throughout history and continues to inspire ongoing research. Motivated by the recent activities on the quantum simulation of topological orders among the ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, we consider the possibility of searching for topological orders among the dipolar quantum magnets and polar molecules with a kagomé lattice geometry. Together with other quantum interactions such as the transverse field, the dipolar interaction endows the kagomé system with a similar structure as the Balents-Fisher-Girvin model and thus fosters the emergence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory to access the topological ordered phase and describe the spinon and vison excitations for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We explain the spectroscopic consequences for various quantum phases as well as the experimental detection. We further discuss the rare-earth kagomé magnets, ultracold polar molecules, and cluster Mott insulators for the physical realization.</p>

            <h2>Positional information trade-offs in boundary-driven reaction-diffusion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Berx, Prashant Singh, Karel Proesmans</p>
            <p>Individual components such as cells, particles, or agents within a larger system often require detailed understanding of their relative position to act accordingly, enabling the system as a whole to function in an organised and efficient manner. Through the concept of positional information, such components are able to specify their position in order to, e.g., create robust spatial patterns or coordinate specific functionality. Such complex behaviour generally occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus requires the dissipation of free energy to sustain functionality. We show that in boundary-driven simple exclusion systems with position-dependent Langmuir kinetics, non-trivial Pareto-optimal trade-offs exist between the positional information, rescaled entropy production rate and global reaction current. Phase transitions in the optimal protocols that tune the densities of the system boundaries emerge as a result, showing that distinct protocols are able to exchange global optimality similar to phase coexistence in liquid-gas phase transitions, and that increasing the positional information can lead to diminishing returns when considering increased dissipation.</p>

            <p>At the mesoscale, the avalanche-like plastic bursts are associated with statistical signatures, whose parameters are not always well defined. In this work, we performed large scale and realistic Dislocation Dynamics simulations of the deformation of fcc Cu in bulk systems under fixed strain rate. Our results show that the power law exponent is not impacted by the dislocation density nor the loading direction. However, dislocation density controls the scaling of the power law truncation in avalanche statistics and triggering stress at the origin of plastic events. The correlation between the activities of slip systems is highlighted. Our quantitative data can provide explanations for some experimental observations and help link the mesoscopic plasticity picture to larger-scale models.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Matrix Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arya Bangun, Oleh Melnyk, Benjamin März</p>
            <p>We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</p>

            <p>Anyons are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states and they are believed to enable topological quantum computing. One-dimensional (1D) anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here, we observe anyonic correlations, which emerge through the phenomenon of spin-charge separation, in a 1D strongly-interacting quantum gas. The required spin degree of freedom is provided by a mobile impurity, whose effective anyonic correlations are associated with an experimentally tunable statistical angle. These anyonic correlations are measured by monitoring the impurity momentum distribution, whose asymmetric feature demonstrates the transmutation of bosons via anyons to fermions. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we study the dynamical properties of the anyonic correlations via dynamical fermionization of the anyons. Our work opens up the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting.</p>

            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional magnets can host an ordered longitudinal spin-density wave state (LSDW) in magnetic field at low temperature, when longitudinal correlations are strengthened by Ising anisotropies. In the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbAlO3 this happens via Ising-like interchain interactions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a sharp, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alaska Subedi</p>
            <p>Layered nickelates are believed to exhibit superconductivity similar to that found in the cuprates. However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</p>

            <p>The bulk phase of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) has long been a subject of extensive investigation due to their utility as coating materials, electrocatalysts, and diffusion barriers, attributed to their high conductivity and refractory properties. Downscaling TMNs into two-dimensional (2D) forms would provide valuable members to the existing 2D materials repertoire, with potential enhancements across various applications. Moreover, calculations have anticipated the emergence of uncommon physical phenomena in TMNs at the 2D limit. In this study, we use the atomic substitution approach to synthesize 2D W5N6 with tunable thicknesses from tens of nanometers down to 2.9 nm. The obtained flakes exhibit high crystallinity and smooth surfaces. Electrical measurements on 15 samples show an average electrical conductivity of 161.1 S/cm, which persists while thickness decreases from 45.6 nm to 2.9 nm. The observed weak gate tuning effect suggests the semimetallic nature of the synthesized 2D W5N6. Further investigation into the conversion mechanism elucidates the crucial role of chalcogen vacancies in the precursor for initiating the reaction and strain in propagating the conversion. Our work introduces a desired semimetallic crystal to the 2D material library with mechanistic insights for future design of the synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Audrey A. Watkins, Osama R. Bilal</p>
            <p>Simple local interactions can cause primitive building blocks to self-assemble into complex and functional patterns. However, even for a small number of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are plausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically shift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails navigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this paper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to create metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a boundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks into different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the magnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials that morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using the same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to control the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with rich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into functional and tunable devices.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic magnetic response in ABA type trilayered systems and compensation phenomenon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enakshi Guru, Sonali Saha, Sankhasubhra Nag</p>
            <p>Dynamic magnetic response in a trilayered structure with non-equivalent layers (ABA type) has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis algorithm. In each layer, ferromagnetic (FM) nearest neighbour Ising interactions are present along with antiferromagnetic (AFM) nearest neighbour coupling across different layers. The system is studied under a harmonically oscillating external magnetic field. It is revealed that along with dynamic phase transition (DPT), compensation phenomenon emerges in this system under dynamic scenario too. This feature in dynamic case is unique for such trilayered systems only, in contrast to the bulk system reported earlier. The temporal behaviour of the magnetisation of each individual layer shows that different magnetic response of the non-equivalent layers results into such dynamic compensation phenomenon. The difference in response also results into warping of the dynamic hysteresis loops, under various external parameter values, such as amplitude of the oscillating field and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang</p>
            <p>We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Soto Garcia, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are characterised by the universal scaling laws in the critical region surrounding the transitions. This universality is also manifested in the critical real-time dynamics through the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In recent experiments on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been used to probe the nature of quantum phase transitions. In this paper we analyze the caveats associated with this method and develop strategies to improve its accuracy. Focusing on two minimal models -- transverse-field Ising and three-state Potts -- we study the effect of boundary conditions, the location of the endpoints and some subtleties in the definition of the kink operators. In particular, we show that the critical scaling of the most intuitive types of kinks is extremely sensitive to the correct choice of endpoint, while more advanced types of kinks exhibit remarkably robust universal scaling. Furthermore, we show that when kinks are tracked over the entire chain, fixed boundary conditions improve the accuracy of the scaling. Surprisingly, the Kibble-Zurek critical scaling appears to be equally accurate whether the fixed boundary conditions are chosen to be symmetric or anti-symmetric. Finally, we show that the density of kinks extracted in the central part of long chains obeys the predicted universal scaling for all types of boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol. We experimentally implemented a quantum Otto heat engine using spin-1/2 nuclei on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor. We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</p>

            <p>We obtain the first analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-based diffusion models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score (ELS) machine that, (3) without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.90, 0.91, 0.94$ on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST). Our ELS machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.75$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.</p>

            <p>Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-Ångström probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</p>

We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras. In part II of the paper, we demonstrate how the emittance metric enables rapid online tuning of the aberration corrector using Bayesian optimization.</p>

Using tools from quantum information theory such as generalized concurrence, negativity, and various measures of quantum, classical, and total correlations in bipartite states we demonstrate that these measures effectively identify quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at critical points. Our negativity analysis reveals nearly identical results at zero or very low temperatures. Importantly, we find that partial concurrence, defined with the reduced density matrix, detects more quantum critical points than total concurrence. Additionally, we argue that spin chains with an odd number of spins are more effective than those with an even number in identifying QPTs.</p>

            <p>Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</p>

We derive the linear scaling rule between the learning rate (step size) and the batch size, and identify universal and non-universal aspects of weight matrix dynamics. We test our findings in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine and in a linear one-hidden-layer neural network.</p>

            <h2>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D'Hoker, Thomas T. Dumitrescu, Efrat Gerchkovitz, Emily Nardoni</p>
            <p>We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</p>

            <h2>Universal hyper-scaling relations, power-law tails, and data analysis for strong anomalous diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Vollmer, Claudio Giberti, Jordan Orchard, Hannes Reinhard, Carlos Mejía-Monasterio, Lamberto Rondoni</p>
            <p>Strong anomalous diffusion is {often} characterized by a piecewise-linear spectrum of the moments of displacement. The spectrum is characterized by slopes $\xi$ and $\zeta$ for small and large moments, respectively, and by the critical moment $\alpha$ of the crossover. The exponents $\xi$ and $\zeta$ characterize the asymptotic scaling of the bulk and the tails of the probability distribution function of displacements, respectively. Here, we adopt asymptotic theory to match the behaviors at intermediate scales. The resulting constraint explains how distributions with algebraic tails imply strong anomalous diffusion, and it relates $\alpha$ to the corresponding power law. Our theory provides novel relations between exponents characterizing strong anomalous diffusion, and it yields explicit expressions for the leading-order corrections to the asymptotic power-law behavior of the moments of displacement. They provide the time scale that must be surpassed to clearly discriminate the leading-order power law from its sub-leading corrections. This insight allows us to point out sources of systematic errors in their numerical estimates. Rather than separately fitting an exponent for each moment we devise a robust scheme to determine $\xi$, $\zeta$ and $\alpha$. The findings are supported by numerical and analytical results on five different models exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Envelope presentation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Bin Chen</p>
            <p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p>

            <h2>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim N. Chernodub, Vladimir A. Goy, Alexander V. Molochkov, Konstantin R. Pak, Alexey S. Tanashkin</p>
            <p>In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</p>

            <h2>Aging behavior of the scale-free network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
            <p>The number of users on social media continues to increase during the growth phase. Still, eventually, the number of new users balances out the number of departing users, and the number of users becomes almost constant. To investigate how network properties change under these conditions, we study the aging behavior of the network. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab'asi model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We defined $\alpha$ as the node deletion parameter and $\beta$ as the node addition parameter. The larger $\alpha$ yields, the higher the probability of deleting a node with a larger degree, and the larger $\beta$ yields, the higher the probability of connecting to a node with a larger degree and fitness. We found that the network cannot reach a steady state in some parameter regions. We investigated the degree distribution of the network that reached a steady state. The scale-free nature of the network broke down in regions where $\alpha$ is large and $\beta$ is small, and the degree distribution became exponential. We also performed percolation analyses. While the phase transition point was zero in the scale-free network, the phase transition point changed finitely in regions with large $\alpha$ and small $\beta$. The phase diagram of whether the degree distribution is power-law or exponential and whether the phase transition point of percolation is zero or finite exhibits a good agreement between the phase boundaries. This study is expected to help control network structure in mature networks.</p>

            <h2>Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Geiko</p>
            <p>There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>We study the surface code under the most general single-qubit $X$-error channel, encompassing both coherent and incoherent errors. We develop a statistical mechanics mapping for the decoding problem and represent the partition function as a transfer-matrix, i.e., a (1+1)$D$ hybrid quantum circuit. The relevant circuit evolution, as we show, has an efficient matrix product state approximation, using which we develop an algorithm for large-scale syndrome sampling, thus enabling the simulation of these non-Pauli errors away from the limits captured by previous methods. Using these results, we compute maximum-likelihood thresholds and show that error coherence has negligible influence away from the fully coherent limit. We also study how coherence impacts information-theoretic measures like the coherent information, which we show to require, for accurate threshold estimates, increasingly large codes upon increasing error coherence and to eventually break down in the fully coherent limit. To interpret the dominant effect of incoherent errors in large codes, we develop a phenomenological errorfield double field theory, which indicates the instability of coherent errors' above-threshold quasi-long-range order to the above-threshold disorder characteristic of bit-flip errors and the suppression of coherence in the logical noise channel.</p>

            <p>Any local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. This deformation preserves all continuous internal symmetries, $\mathcal{S}$, and therefore also preserves any 't Hooft anomalies supported purely in $\mathcal{S}$. We describe the resulting phase diagram in the case of SCFTs that arise as the endpoints of renormalization group flows from 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories with any number of $U(1)$ gauge group factors and arbitrary integer charges for the matter fields. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR), and we explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQFTs. Finally, using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Aldo Venturelli, Sreetama Das, Filippo Caruso</p>
            <p>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) ideal for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, and is highly successful for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). It has been observed that the optimal variational parameters obtained from one instance of a COP can be transferred to another instance, producing sufficiently satisfactory solutions for the latter. In this context, a suitable method for further improving the solution is to fine-tune a subset of the transferred parameters. We numerically explore the role of optimizing individual QAOA layers in improving the approximate solution of the Max-Cut problem after parameter transfer. We also investigate the trade-off between a good approximation and the required optimization time when optimizing transferred QAOA parameters. These studies show that optimizing a subset of layers can be more effective at a lower time-cost compared to optimizing all layers.</p>

            <p>To make efficient use of limited physical resources, the brain must match its coding and computational strategies to the statistical structure of input signals. An attractive testing ground for these principles is the problem of motion estimation in the fly visual system: we understand the optics of the compound eye, have a quantitative description of input signals and noise from the retina, and can record from output neurons that encode estimates of different velocity components. Furthermore, recent work provides a nearly complete wiring diagram of the intervening circuitry. What is missing is a characterization of the visual signals and motions that flies encounter in a natural context. We attack this directly with the development of a specialized camera that matches the high temporal resolution, optical properties, and spectral sensitivity of the fly's eye; inertial motion sensors provide ground truth about rotations and translations through the world. We describe the design, construction, and performance characteristics of this FlEye camera. To illustrate the opportunities created by this instrument we use data on movies and motion to construct optimal local motion estimators that can be compared with the responses of the fly's motion sensitive neurons.</p>

By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pak Hang Chris Lau, Kanji Nishii, Toshifumi Noumi</p>
            <p>We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions admits a finite non-invertible symmetry described mathematically by a fusion category. This symmetry is spontaneously broken at long distances, leading to distinct vacua. When the theory has a mass gap, the spectrum is therefore characterized by particle excitations above a single vacuum and soliton sectors interpolating between vacua. We use anyon condensation and the representation theory of fusion categories to obtain exact results about this spectrum, exhibiting the allowed multiplets. Often, particles and solitons are in the same representation and therefore must have equal masses. Furthermore, the fusion category symmetry frequently implies the existence of certain stable states in the spectrum. The resulting degeneracies are encoded in quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are excited states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rainer Engelken, Michael Monteforte, Fred Wolf</p>
            <p>Nerve impulses, the currency of information flow in the brain, are generated by an instability of the neuronal membrane potential dynamics. Neuronal circuits exhibit collective chaos that appears essential for learning, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. However, the factors controlling the nature and intensity of collective chaos in neuronal circuits are not well understood. Here we use computational ergodic theory to demonstrate that basic features of nerve impulse generation profoundly affect collective chaos in neuronal circuits. Numerically exact calculations of Lyapunov spectra, Kolmogorov-Sinai-entropy, and upper and lower bounds on attractor dimension show that changes in nerve impulse generation in individual neurons moderately impact information encoding rates but qualitatively transform phase space structure. Specifically, we find a drastic reduction in the number of unstable manifolds, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and attractor dimension. Beyond a critical point, marked by the simultaneous breakdown of the diffusion approximation, a peak in the largest Lyapunov exponent, and a localization transition of the leading covariant Lyapunov vector, networks exhibit sparse chaos: prolonged periods of near stable dynamics interrupted by short bursts of intense chaos. Analysis of large, more realistically structured networks supports the generality of these findings. In cortical circuits, biophysical properties appear tuned to this regime of sparse chaos. Our results reveal a close link between fundamental aspects of single-neuron biophysics and the collective dynamics of cortical circuits, suggesting that nerve impulse generation mechanisms are adapted to enhance circuit controllability and information flow.</p>

            <p>When a system consists of a large subsystem (bath) and a small one (probe), thermalization implies induction of temperature of the bath onto the probe. If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as {\it phase thermalization}. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show {\it phase thermalization} is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N > n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction. In deep infrared (\emph{i.e.} at very low energies), the probe turns into an incoherent metal, with Lyapunov spectrum and diffusion coefficient identical to the bath.</p>

            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Polymer networks which locally rotate to accommodate stresses, torques, and deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Grasinger</p>
            <p>Polymer network models construct the constitutive relationships of a broader polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions (than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies (e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas G. Kiely, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Electrons can organize themselves into charge-ordered states to minimize the effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions. In the presence of a lattice, commensurability constraints lead to the emergence of incompressible Wigner-Mott insulators at various rational electron fillings, $\nu~=p/q$. The mechanism for quantum fluctuation-mediated melting of the Mott insulators with increasing electron kinetic energy remains an outstanding problem. Here, using matrix product state techniques, we analyze the bandwidth-tuned transition out of the Wigner-Mott insulator at $\nu=1/5$ in an extended Hubbard model on infinite cylinders of varying circumference. For the two-leg ladder, the transition from the Mott insulator to the Luttinger liquid proceeds via a distinct intermediate phase with gapless Cooper-pairs and gapped electronic excitations. The resulting Luther-Emery liquid is the analog of a strongly fluctuating superconductor. We place these results in the context of a low-energy bosonization based theory for the transition. On the five-leg cylinder, we provide numerical evidence for a direct continuous transition between the Wigner-Mott insulator and a metallic phase across which the spin and charge-gaps vanish simultaneously. We comment on the connections to ongoing experiments in dual-gated bilayer moiré transition metal dichalcogenide materials.</p>

Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</p>

            <h2>Flat bands and superconductivity induced by periodic strain in monolayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyao Meng, Runyu Ma, Tianxing Ma, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a monolayer graphene with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor $d+id$ pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Rashba spin splitting and persistent spin helices based on SU(2) symmetry in PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu</p>
            <p>2D materials can host interesting physics and have important applications in various fields. Recent experiment shows that monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoflakes with neutral zigzag edges are stable. Here, we study semiconducting stoichiometric PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons with the stable neutral zigzag edges (with $N$ describing different nanoribbon width) through combining detailed first-principles investigation with low-energy model analysis. Our careful analysis of first-principles conduction and valence bands (with the spin-orbits coupling taken into account) indicates that the low-energy bands assume relativistic energy dispersion in an energy window of [-0.2 eV, 0.2eV] (at least) and have large unconventional Rashba spin splitting (for even $N$). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the low-energy bands can be well described by an effective one-dimensional electron model and the semiconductor gap will remain finite even for large $N$. Most importantly, it is shown that there exists SU(2) spin symmetry in both of the conduction and valence bands for each edge, which implies persistent spin helices (in the spin xy plane) and spin-conserving carrier transport. When the inter-edge interaction becomes weak ($N$ is large enough), a nearly-perfect Dirac fermion system can be achieved through combining the valence and conduction bands. Thus we realize unconventional Rashba splitting, double SU(2) spin symmetry, persistent spin helices/textures, and pure Dirac fermion systems in stable monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Lovarelli, Fabrizio Mazziotti, Demetrio Logoteta, Giuseppe Iannaccone</p>
            <p>Reducing the contact resistance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional materials is one of the key improvements required to enable the integration of such transistors in an advanced semiconductor manufacturing process. Suitably designed lateral heterojunctions provide an opportunity to independently tailor the contact and channel properties in order to optimize contact resistance. Inspired by the recent experimental demonstration of a two-dimensional $p$-type Schottky barrier, here we use quantum transport simulations to estimate the performance of $p$-type transistors in which the channel consists of a lateral heterostructure of NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ (semimetal-semiconductor-semimetal). We find that the gate alignment with the channel is a critical design parameter, strongly influencing the capability of the gate to modulate the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ interface. This effect is also found to significantly affect the scaling behavior of the device.</p>

            <h2>Phase Switch Driven by the Hidden Half-Ice, Half-Fire State in a Ferrimagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik</p>
            <p>The notion of "half fire, half ice" was recently introduced to describe an exotic macroscopic ground-state degeneracy emerging in a ferrimagnet under the critical magnetic field, in which the "hot" spins are fully disordered on the sublattice with smaller magnetic moments and the "cold" spins are fully ordered on the sublattice with larger magnetic moments. Here we further point out that this state has a twin named "half ice, half fire" in which the hot and cold spins switch positions. The new state is an excited state -- thus hidden in the ground-state phase diagram -- and is robust with respect to the interactions that destroy the half fire, half ice state. We demonstrate with exact results how this hidden state can drive phase switching at desirable finite temperature, even for the one-dimensional Ising model where phase transition at finite temperature is forbidden. We suggest that our findings may open a new door to the understanding and controlling of phase competition and transition in unconventional frustrated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumendu Bagchi, Danny Perez</p>
            <p>The kinetics of dislocation reactions, such as dislocation multiplication, controls the plastic deformation in crystals beyond their elastic limit, therefore critical mechanisms in a number of applications in materials science. We present a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that shows that one such type of reactions, the nucleation of dislocation at free surfaces, exhibit extremely unconventional kinetics, including unexpectedly large nucleation rates under compression, very strong entropic stabilization under tension, as well as strong non-Arrhenius behavior. These unusual kinetics are quantitatively rationalized using a variational transition state theory approach coupled with an efficient numerical scheme for the estimation of vibrational entropy changes. These results highlight the need for a variational treatment of the kinetics to quantitatively capture dislocation reaction kinetics, especially at low-to-moderate strains where large deformations are required to activate reactions. These observations suggest possible explanations to previously observed unconventional deformation kinetics in both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atri Goswami, Rohn Chatterjee, Sudip Mukherjee</p>
            <p>Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) sets the paradigm for one-dimensional driven single file motion. We study a periodic TASEP with two ``road blocks'' or defects of different kinds, one point and another extended, across which particle flows are inhibited. We show how the interplay between particle number conservation and competition between the defects lead to inhomogeneous steady states with localised domain walls (LDW). The LDW locations jump discontinuously, indicating a discontinuous transition between these LDW states, as the system passes from being controlled by one defect to the other. When the defects are ``competing'', instead of an LDW a pair of delocalised domain walls appear, none of which can penetrate the extended defect. A minimum current principle can be used to identify the dominant defect that controls the domain wall formations. Our results should be important in diverse systems, ranging from protein synthesis by ribosomes in biological cells to urban traffic networks.</p>

            <h2>Universal energy-speed-accuracy trade-offs in driven nonequilibrium systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jérémie Klinger, Grant M. Rotskoff</p>
            <p>Physical systems driven away from equilibrium by an external controller dissipate heat to the environment; the excess entropy production in the thermal reservoir can be interpreted as a "cost" to transform the system in a finite time. The connection between measure theoretic optimal transport and dissipative nonequilibrium dynamics provides a language for quantifying this cost and has resulted in a collection of "thermodynamic speed limits", which argue that the minimum dissipation of a transformation between two probability distributions is directly proportional to the rate of driving. Thermodynamic speed limits rely on the assumption that the target probability distribution is perfectly realized, which is almost never the case in experiments or numerical simulations. Here, we address the ubiquitous situation in which the external controller is imperfect. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the dissipated work in generic nonequilibrium control problems that 1) is asymptotically tight and 2) matches the thermodynamic speed limit in the case of optimal driving. We illustrate these bounds on analytically solvable examples and also develop a strategy for optimizing minimally dissipative protocols based on optimal transport flow matching, a generative machine learning technique. This latter approach ensures the scalability of both the theoretical and computational framework we put forth. Crucially, we demonstrate that we can compute the terms in our bound numerically using efficient algorithms from the computational optimal transport literature and that the protocols that we learn saturate the bound.</p>

We also find intricate structures in a low-energy landscape of spin glasses, such as a power-law distribution of connected clusters with a small surface energy.

            <h2>Numerical study of neutral and charged microgel suspensions: from single-particle to collective behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Del Monte, Emanuela Zaccarelli</p>
            <p>We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing $\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement, always slows down. This behavior, at odds with simple Hertzian model, can be described by a phenomenological multi-Hertzian, which takes into account the enhanced internal stiffness of the core. However, also this model fails when deformation enters into play, whereby more realistic many-body models are required. We are able to unveil the key physical mechanisms, shrinking and deformation, giving rise to the structural reentrance that holds up to very large packing fractions. We further identify key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels, for which we detect at high enough $\zeta$ the fusion of charged shells, previously invoked to explain key experimental findings, and responsible for the structural reentrance. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions, paving the way to tackle different regimes and internal structural architectures, where experimental evidence is still limited.</p>

Due to the feasibility of electric field, how to generate and manipulate magnon with pure electrical method is one of the most desired goals. Here we propose that the magnon spin current is generated by applying time-dependent electric field, where the coupling between the magnon and electric field is invoked via Aharonov-Casher effect. In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and electric-control-magnon mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert Beardo, Prajit Rawte, Chia-Nien Tsai, Mahmoud I. Hussein</p>
            <p>Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction to be approached, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</p>

            <p>The discovery of a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and its novel mechanism holds significant promise for advancing both fundamental research and practical applications. Magnetic kagome lattice materials are uniquely suited for studying the AHE due to their interplay between electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. However, the geometric frustration inherent in kagome lattices often limits the configuration and tunability of magnetic order. Here, we present a new design strategy for kagome-lattice materials with emergent magnetism, exemplified by the magnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which features interwoven magnetic Tb zigzag chains and non-magnetic Ti kagome bilayers. This material exhibits a record-high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 10$^5$ $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a large band folding gap observed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, coexisting spin-density-wave (SDW) order detected through spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and a spiral magnetic order with large magnetic moments identified by neutron diffraction. These findings highlight a strong electron-magnetic coupling between itinerant charges and ordered magnetic moments, offering a spectroscopic explanation for the giant AHC in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. This work establishes a pathway for innovative material design strategies, unlocking new possibilities for future exploration and applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>$\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), an A15 cubic phase of tungsten, exhibits a giant spin Hall angle compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high-quality $\beta$-W films desirable for spintronic applications. We report the controlled growth of $\beta$-W films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates via DC sputtering, where substrate bias serves as a critical factor in stabilizing the $\beta$ phase by regulating the energy of deposited atoms. This approach enables the formation of $\beta$-W films over a wide thickness range. Additionally, we studied the spin pumping phenomena in different tungsten phases achieved through substrate bias. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal an enhancement in the magnetic damping (\( \alpha_{\text{eff}} \)) for $\beta$-W/Py compared to $\alpha$-W/Py dominated film. The effective spin mixing conductance (\( g_{\text{eff}}^{\uparrow\downarrow} \)) is found to be higher in $\beta$-W/Py than in $\alpha$-W/Py, which is attributed to variations in the interface structures between these phases. Importantly, the use of substrate bias does not deteriorate the interface quality, underscoring its effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of substrate bias in thin-film engineering, paving the way for its advanced utilization in spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The Holstein model on a square lattice at half-filling has a well-established finite temperature phase transition to an insulating state with long range charge density wave (CDW) order. Because this CDW formation suppresses pairing, a superconducting (SC) phase emerges only with doping. In this work, we study the effects of dilution of the local phonon degrees of freedom in the Holstein model while keeping the system at half filling. We find not only that the CDW remains present up to a dilution fraction $f \sim 0.15$, but also that long range pairing is stabilized with increasing $f$, resulting in a {\it supersolid} regime centered at $f \approx 0.10$, where long range diagonal and off-diagonal correlations coexist. Further dilution results in a purely SC phase, and ultimately in a normal metal. Our results provide a new route to the supersolid phase via the introduction of impurities at fixed positions which both increase quantum fluctuations and also are immune to the competing tendency to phase separation often observed in the doped case.</p>

            <p>The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the Néel transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the Néel transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of Néel AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.</p>

            <p>In this work, it is shown that improvements can be introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space, which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particle number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy, and the pressure, as well as the thermodynamic state equations corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperatures and for confined volumes. They allow for the highlighting of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamic functions and variables are directly related to the quantum statistical variances of the momenta. Well-known relations corresponding to the classical ideal gas model can be recovered from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperatures and for large volumes.</p>

For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})/u_{n}(\vec{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\vec{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\vec{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\vec{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\vec{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\vec{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\vec{r}) \propto u_{n}(\vec{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperiodic potential, as well as for the uncorrelated random potential in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>Size-invariant shape transformation is a geometric technique that allows for a clear separation between quantum size and shape effects by modifying the shape of the confinement domain without altering its size. The impact of shape on the behavior of confined systems is significantly different from that of size, making it an emerging area of research. The recent realization of flat-bottomed optical box traps has further contributed to the study of quantum gases in complex confinement geometries. Here, we propose shape-induced Bose-Einstein condensation at a fixed size, temperature, and density. We investigate the impact of pure quantum shape effects on a non-interacting Bose gas confined within nested square domains, where the shape parameter is defined and controlled by the rotation angle between the inner and outer squares. Our findings reveal that specific heat exhibits an additional low-temperature peak at certain shapes. This work opens new avenues for controlling quantum systems through geometric manipulation and provides insights into the thermodynamic properties of Bose gases under shape-induced quantum effects.</p>

In addition to the strain effect, we observe a gigantic polarizability volume with the enhancement factor up to 1010. The enormous polarizability leads to a large Quantum-confined Stark shift under a small variation of electric field, indicating the potential of integrating layered materials with functional substrates for quantum sensing. We further demonstrate the tunable diamagnetic shift and g-factor with strain varying by ~0.05%, which confirms the existence of enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the ferroelectric domains. Our results signify the prospect of charged quantum emitters in layered materials for quantum sciences and technology.</p>

            <h2>Josephson diodes induced by the loop current states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Kai Shen, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning-Jing Yang, Zhigao Huang, Jian-Min Zhang</p>
            <p>Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Hossain et al. Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological (FOT) states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d orbital bandgap. Upon coupling of p and d orbitals through the crystal field effect, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition can be tuned via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. The WTe2 exhibits hybrid-order under ambient conditions, while NbSe2 transitions to hybrid-order under pressure. Additionally, the first-order topological bandgap in the HyOTI demonstrates a strong spin Hall effect. Our findings reveal a hybrid-order topological phase in two-dimensional electron materials and underscore spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced correlations due to ballistic transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damiano De Angelis, Jacopo De Nardis, Stefano Scopa</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of density-density correlations in a 1D gas of hard-core particles initially prepared at equilibrium (either at zero or finite temperature) on a semi-infinite line and subsequently let to expand into the other (initially empty) half of the system. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on exact methods and asymptotic hydrodynamic approaches, we discuss the behavior of the gas as its initial temperature varies, and back up our derivations with numerical exact diagonalization of the model. Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the initial temperature, the non-equilibrium behavior of density-density correlations at sufficiently large times is characterized by algebraic decay. Furthermore, we provide analytical results based on quantum generalized hydrodynamics that match with the numerical data both at zero and finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Coupled spin and valley Hall effects driven by coherent tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Zeng</p>
            <p>We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with the broken inversion symmetry and proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</p>

We formulate the theory of low-intensity resonance fluorescence in the presence of white noise and show that a high level of control is achievable with a two-tone acoustic field for appropriate settings of modulation amplitudes as long as the noise-induced phase diffusion coefficient remains one order of magnitude smaller than the acoustic frequency. In addition, using a quantitative model of optical signal collection, we determine that the acoustic phase must be stable over $\mathbf{10^4}$ to $\mathbf{10^5}$ acoustic periods for efficient control.</p>

            <p>Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on user-item similarities through rating data, which may involve numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are often employed to predict scores for unrated items. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. Previous studies have employed NBMF for image analysis where the data were dense. In this paper, we propose a modified NBMF algorithm that can be applied to collaborative filtering where data are sparse. In the modified method, unrated elements in a rating matrix are masked, which improves the collaborative filtering performance. Utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</p>

            <h2>Backbone Mediated Electrical Transport in a Double-Stranded DNA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Kundu, Siddhartha Lal</p>
            <p>In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases of double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that electronic transport happens through the backbone channels instead of {\pi}-{\pi} interaction of the nitrogen bases. These new experimental insights call for a detail investigation. In keeping with this, we examine charge transport properties of three characteristic double-stranded DNA sequences (periodic GC, periodic AT and random ATGC sequences) within a tight-binding framework where backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green function method, we inspect the single-particle density of states and localization properties of DNA in the presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of these nicks on current-voltage response using the Landauer - Buttiker formalism for a two-terminal geometry where the source electrode is attached to one backbone strand and the drain to the other. We observe that the periodic DNA sequence of GC bases is metallic in nature, while the periodic AT sequence and the random ATGC sequence are insulating. Further, the effects of nicks on the transport properties of the periodic GC sequence is interesting: while a single nick on the upper backbone does not affect electronic transport, the addition of a second nick on the lower backbone causes the current to vanish altogether. This is found to be robust against changes in the positions of the nicks, as well as the alternation of the source and drain electrodes.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</p>

            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle moving on a half-line with a periodic force field and an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics. The periodic force field is assumed to be such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation. The Laplace transform of this equation yields systems of equations satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle reaches the origin in finite time almost surely. We calculate the exit probability of the particle, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the exit probability is less than one. If the force field is a constant drift, the condition is satisfied by positive values of the drift. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form in both regimes.</p>

            <p>We analyze the aggregation of locally amphiphilic copolymers with blocky architecture and uniformly distributed amphiphilic moieties in terms of a mean-field theory. Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many thermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with local surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich diversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit of high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants. Depending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and interaction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build morphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume pendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing these pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large vesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the chain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and shapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the blocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or spherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large polar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound micelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are located in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by locally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of dense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of nanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.</p>

            <p>Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</p>

Spin-valley-dependent electronic states with distinct spin textures offer potential applications in spintronic devices. Our calculations reveal helical and chiral spin texture for spin-up, and spin-down respectively, by opposing electron and hole orientation in the conduction and valence bands. The Berry curvature behavior in the vicinity of the Dirac points for different values of $\alpha$, reveals a sign change and topological phase transitions in 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$. When $\alpha<1$, the system exhibits the Quantum Spin Hall Insulator (QSHI) phase ($C_s=1$), characterized by a non-trivial gap and helical edge mode. $\alpha>1$ is responsible for a topological phase transition to the band insulator (BI) ($C_v=1$) and killing the edge modes. Also when $\alpha=1$ the Fermi energy falls within the bands, consequently, the Chern number is not defined. Calculations of spin Nernst (SNC), valley Nernst (VNC), and total Nernst coefficients (TNC) further confirm the QSHI-to-BI phase transition under varying $\alpha$ and doping. These results provide comprehensive insights into the tunable topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ and their implications for spintronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

            <p>We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower. Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., Phys. Rev. B 103, 155102 (2021), arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 011037 (2022), arXiv:2106.05959).

Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field.

            <p>The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out.

We calculate the internal energy of the spin chain and the system temperature using the Rényi distribution and postulate them to be equal to their counterparts, obtained in the microcanonical ensemble. It allows us to self-consistently derive the Rényi $q$-index and the Lagrange parameter $T$ to relate them to the physically observed system temperature $T_{\rm ph}$, and to show that the entropic phase transitions are possible in a broad temperature domain. We have also studied the temperature dependence of the internal energy $U(T_{\rm ph})$ at constant $q$ and an influence of the size related effects on the system thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Effect of arsenic doping on structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer: an ab initio study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Bradji, M. L. Benkhedir</p>
            <p>In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Qi Yu, Wei Cheng, Chuang Li, Xiao-Hong Pan, Gang Xu, Fu-Chun Zhang, Xin Liu</p>
            <p>Building on the multiband nature of iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), we have uncovered pronounced anisotropy in Majorana vortex topology arising from the interaction between vortex orientation and multiple electronic topologies. This anisotropy manifests in two distinct vortex configurations: the z-vortex and x-vortex, oriented perpendicular and parallel to the Dirac axis (z-axis for FeSCs), respectively. The x-vortex exhibits a unique duality, displaying two distinct topological phase diagrams. One is strikingly simple, comprising only trivial and topological superconducting phases, and remains resilient to multiband entanglement. The other mirrors the z-vortex's complex diagram, featuring alternating trivial, topological crystalline and topological superconducting phases. Crucially, the former is exclusive to the x-vortex and supports unpaired Majorana vortices across a wide parameter range, even with Dirac nodes in electronic bands. Notably, uniaxial strain can modulate these x-vortex phases, enabling the x-vortex to support both stable Majorana vortices and rich exotic physics in a controllable manner. Moreover, we propose that the x-vortex offers promising advantages for developing iron-based superconducting quantum devices. Our findings introduce a novel paradigm in vortex topology within multiband superconducting systems, highlighting the x-vortex as a promising platform for exploring Majorana physics and advancing iron-based superconducting quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>The effect of grain boundary misorientation on hydrogen flux using a phase-field based diffusion and trapping model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelrahman Hussein, Byungki Kim, Kim Verbeken, Tom Depover</p>
            <p>Understanding hydrogen-grain boundary (GB) interactions is critical to the analysis of hydrogen embrittlement in metals. This work presents a mesoscale fully kinetic model to investigate the effect of GB misorientation on hydrogen diffusion and trapping using phase-field based representative volume elements (RVEs). The flux equation consists of three terms: a diffusive term and two terms for high and low angle grain boundary (H/LAGB) trapping. Uptake simulations showed that decreasing the grain size resulted in higher hydrogen content due to increasing the GB density. Permeation simulations showed that GBs are high flux paths due to their higher enrichment with hydrogen. Since HAGBs have higher enrichment than LAGBs, due to their higher trap-binding energy, they generally have the highest hydrogen flux. Nevertheless, the flux shows a convoluted behavior as it depends on the local concentration, alignment of GB with external concentration gradient as well as the GB network connectivity. Finally, decreasing the grain size resulted in a larger break-through time and a larger steady-state exit flux.</p>

            <p>Following the concept of creating individual centers, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seán R. Kavanagh</p>
            <p>Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</p>

            <p>We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We present a non-perturbative framework for incorporating gauge field fluctuations into effective actions of QED3 in the infrared using fermionic particle-vortex duality. This approach is demonstrated through the applications to models containing N species of 2-component Dirac fermions in solvable and interpretable electromagnetic backgrounds, focusing on N = 1 or 2. For the N = 1 model, we establish a correspondence between fermion Casimir energy at finite density and the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, and further evaluate the corrections to their amplitudes. This predicts amplification of charge susceptibility and reduction of magnetic permeability. We additionally provide physical interpretations for each component of our calculation and offer alternative derivations based on energy density measurements in different characteristic lengths. For N = 2, we show that magnetic catalysis is erased in a U(1)xU(1) QED3, indicating no breakdown of chiral symmetry. Reasoning is offered based on the properties of the lowest Landau level wave functions.</p>

            <p>We calculate the typical bipartite entanglement entropy $\langle S_A\rangle_N$ in systems containing indistinguishable particles of any kind as a function of the total particle number $N$, the volume $V$, and the subsystem fraction $f=V_A/V$, where $V_A$ is the volume of the subsystem.

We illustrate the generality of our findings by studying a wide range of different systems, e.g., bosons, fermions, spins, and mixtures thereof. We provide evidence that our analytical results describe the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic spin and boson systems, which is distinct from that of integrable counterparts.</p>

            <p>This work investigates adversarial training in the context of margin-based linear classifiers in the high-dimensional regime where the dimension $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\alpha = n / d$. We introduce a tractable mathematical model where the interplay between the data and adversarial attacker geometries can be studied, while capturing the core phenomenology observed in the adversarial robustness literature. Our main theoretical contribution is an exact asymptotic description of the sufficient statistics for the adversarial empirical risk minimiser, under generic convex and non-increasing losses for a Block Feature Model. Our result allow us to precisely characterise which directions in the data are associated with a higher generalisation/robustness trade-off, as defined by a robustness and a usefulness metric. We show that the the presence of multiple different feature types is crucial to the high sample complexity performances of adversarial training. In particular, we unveil the existence of directions which can be defended without penalising accuracy. Finally, we show the advantage of defending non-robust features during training, identifying a uniform protection as an inherently effective defence mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Bai, Akihiro Miyata, Masahiro Nozaki</p>
            <p>We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</p>

            <h2>Gravity from entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-Kähler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p>Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.</p>

The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform.

            <p>Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches. Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</p>

            <p>Cement production, exceeding 4.1 billion tonnes and contributing 2.4 tonnes of CO2 annually, faces critical challenges in quality control and process optimization. While traditional process models for cement manufacturing are confined to steady-state conditions with limited predictive capability for mineralogical phases, modern plants operate under dynamic conditions that demand real-time quality assessment. Here, exploiting a comprehensive two-year operational dataset from an industrial cement plant, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts clinker mineralogy from process data. Our model achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy for major clinker phases while requiring minimal input parameters, demonstrating robust performance under varying operating conditions. Through post-hoc explainable algorithms, we interpret the hierarchical relationships between clinker oxides and phase formation, providing insights into the functioning of an otherwise black-box model. This digital twin framework can potentially enable real-time optimization of cement production, thereby providing a route toward reducing material waste and ensuring quality while reducing the associated emissions under real plant conditions. Our approach represents a significant advancement in industrial process control, offering a scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <h2>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Legramandi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thijs G.I. van Wijk, E. Aylin Melan, Rani Mary Joy, Emerick Y. Guillaume, Paulius Pobedinskas, Ken Haenen, Danny E. P. Vanpoucke</p>
            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, C. Witteveen, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, M. Bartkowiak, H. Luetkens, R. Khasanov, F.O. von Rohr, Z. Guguchia</p>
            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <h2>Orbital-Selective Diffuse Magnetic Fluctuations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: a Unified Theoretical Picture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Alexander N. Rudenko, Yvan Sidis, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit.

We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.</p>

            <h2>Phase diagram of the XXZ pyrochlore model from pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shraddha Singh, Gil Refael, Aashish Clerk, Emma Rosenfeld</p>
            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aude Maier, Freya Behrens, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <h2>Taming Landau level mixing in fractional quantum Hall states with deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubing Qian, Tongzhou Zhao, Jianxiao Zhang, Tao Xiang, Xiang Li, Ji Chen</p>
            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Sticking coefficient for atoms impinging on a metallic surfaces, and the x-ray photoemission by metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Diniz</p>
            <p>Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozières-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Ghasemzadeh, M. Farokhnezhad, M. Esmaeilzadeh</p>
            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of interlayer magnetic coupling across the interface in antiferromagnetic bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Halder, Sudip Mandal, Kalpataru Pradhan</p>
            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

            <h2>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</h2>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <h2>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Lorez, Mohit Pundir</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shisheng Lin, Shaoqi Huang, Minhui Yang, Xin Chen, Hongjia Bi, Kangchen Xiong</p>
            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Trenins, Mariana Rossi</p>
            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

            <p>An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite.

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

            <p>The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Canon Sun, Joseph Maciejko</p>
            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory.

            <h2>Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Lobo, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose</p>
            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Effective Energy, Interactions And Out Of Equilibrium Nature Of Scalar Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonin Brossollet, Etienne Lempereur, Stéphane Mallat, Giulio Biroli</p>
            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha</p>
            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei</p>
            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction.

            <p>Building on our recent study [this https URL, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing dynamic range through quantum deamplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu</p>
            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <h2>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</h2>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Turbulent dissipative coupling in nanoscale multimode superfluid acoustics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> King L. Ng, Luís H. Carnevale, Michał Klamka, Piotr Deuar, Tomasz Bobinski, Panagiotis E. Theodorakis</p>
            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropy-driven topological quantum phase transition in magnetic impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</h2>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <h2>Thermal decay of two-spinon bound states in quasi-2D triangular antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. L. Pomponio, E. A. Ghioldi, C. J. Gazza, L. O. Manuel, A. E. Trumper</p>
            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujia Wang, Bruno Ventéjou, Hugues Chaté, Xia-qing Shi</p>
            <p>We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</p>
            <p>We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Cheng, Pablo de Vera, Rafael Garcia-Molina</p>
            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <h2>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau.

            <h2>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</h2>

            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>

            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannik Schaden, Matías G. Gonzalez, Johannes Reuther</p>
            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Diniz</p>
            <p>Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozières-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</p>

            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

            <h2>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</h2>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <h2>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Lorez, Mohit Pundir</p>
            <p>Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Garnier-Brun, Ruben Zakine, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</p>

            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>

            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite.

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Effective Energy, Interactions And Out Of Equilibrium Nature Of Scalar Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonin Brossollet, Etienne Lempereur, Stéphane Mallat, Giulio Biroli</p>
            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous currents and spontaneous vortices in spin-orbit coupled superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Levitan, Yuval Oreg, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <h2>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joydeep Das, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Sudeshna Sinha</p>
            <p>We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the Péclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high Péclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high Péclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Bucca, Márk Mezei</p>
            <p>The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</p>

We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction.

            <p>Building on our recent study [this https URL, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</p>

            <p>We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing dynamic range through quantum deamplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu</p>
            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d>2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</p>

            <h2>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</h2>

            <p>The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lydia J Bardwell Speltz, Seung-Kyun Lee, Yunhong Shu, Matt A Bernstein</p>
            <p>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</p>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <h2>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodore McKeever, Owen Diba, Ahsan Nazir</p>
            <p>With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</p>

            <p>Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</p>

            <p>Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Germán G. Blesio, Luis O. Manuel, Armando A. Aligia</p>
            <p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</p>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</p>

            <p>A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</p>

By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Raux, Christophe Goupil, Gatien Verley</p>
            <p>In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</p>

In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eleftherios Mainas, Richard M. Stratt</p>
            <p>How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} < 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</p>

            <p>We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite Néel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the Néel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Condensation and Synchronization in Aligning Chiral Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yujia Wang, Bruno Ventéjou, Hugues Chaté, Xia-qing Shi</p>
            <p>We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Edelstein effect from the gradient of a scalar potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</p>
            <p>We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Topological Classification of One-Dimensional Chiral Symmetric Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry MullineauxSanders, Bernd Braunecker</p>
            <p>We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</p>

Within our approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming transition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.</p>

            <h2>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Gaite</p>
            <p>The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</p>

            <h2>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</h2>

            <p>Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</p>

            <p>The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</p>

            <h2>When does a Fermi puddle become a Fermi sea? Emergence of pairing in two-dimensional trapped mesoscopic Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma K. Laird, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jia Wang, Matthew J. Davis</p>
            <p>Pairing lies at the heart of superfluidity in fermionic systems. Motivated by recent experiments in mesoscopic Fermi gases, we study up to six fermionic atoms with equal masses and equal populations in two different spin states, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap. We couple a stochastic variational approach with the use of an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which enables us to obtain highly accurate energies and structural properties. Utilising two-dimensional two-body scattering theory with a finite-range Gaussian interaction potential, we tune the effective range to model realistic quasi-two-dimensional scattering. We calculate the excitation spectrum, pair correlation function, and number of pairs as a function of increasing attractive interaction strength. For up to six fermions in the ground state, we find that opposite spin and momentum pairing is maximised well below the Fermi surface in momentum space. By contrast, corresponding experiments on twelve fermions have found that pairing is maximal at the Fermi surface and strongly suppressed beneath [M. Holten et al., Nature 606, 287-291 (2022)]. This suggests that the Fermi sea $-$ which acts to suppress pairing at low momenta via Pauli blocking $-$ emerges in the transition from six to twelve particles.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in a $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</p>

            <p>The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Cheng, Pablo de Vera, Rafael Garcia-Molina</p>
            <p>The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</p>

The rapid response in the former process is applicable to a direct determination of temporal overlap between THz and X-ray pulses for THz pump-X-ray probe experiments with an accuracy of a few picoseconds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. L. Figueiredo, J. T. Mendonça, H. Terças</p>
            <p>A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</p>

            <p>ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990°C to 1220°C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</p>

            <p>Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schrödinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</p>

            <p>2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mordechai Gruda, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Reimer Kühn</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</p>

            <h2>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changle Liu, Guijing Duan, Rong Yu</p>
            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Feng Zhao, Antia S. Botana</p>
            <p>Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have recently been reported in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates with general chemical formula La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n=$ number of perovskite layers along the $c$-axis). The emergence of superconductivity is always concomitant with a structural transition in which the octahedral tilts are suppressed causing an increase in the out-of-plane $d_{z^2}$ orbital overlap. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore biaxial strain (both compressive and tensile) as a means to mimic the electronic structure characteristics of RP nickelates (up to $n=5$) under hydrostatic pressure. Our findings highlight that strain allows to decouple the structural and electronic structure effects obtained under hydrostatic pressure, with tensile strain reproducing the known electronic structure characteristics of the pressurized bilayer and trilayer compounds. Overall, strain represents a promising way to tune the electronic structure of RP nickelates and could be an alternative route to achieve superconductivity in this family of materials.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s < \Phi < (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy A. Slipko, Yuriy V. Pershin</p>
            <p>This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</p>

            <p>Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</p>

            <p>Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</p>

            <p>Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</p>

            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</p>

            <p>We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <h2>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</p>

            <p>In this work, we have implemented an accurate machine-learning approach for predicting various key analog and RF parameters of Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistors (NCFETs). Visual TCAD simulator and the Python high-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However, the computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning approach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different sources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an artificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output relationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across various temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses ($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$, the switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower compared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the switching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore, at substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\%$ from $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio increases by $41\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that $T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal settings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These findings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and integrated circuit (IC) design.</p>

            <h2>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Legramandi, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</p>

            <h2>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</h2>

            <p>Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</h2>

            <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo H. da Silva Neto, Alex Frano, Fabio Boschini</p>
            <p>Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Bałut, Xuefei Guo, Niels de Vries, Dipanjan Chaudhuri, Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in Correlated, Multiband, and Topological Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grgur Palle</p>
            <p>In this thesis, we theoretically examine the pairing mechanisms and the identification of the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors whose normal states are correlated, multiband, or topological. In the first part, we investigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive unconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity loop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop currents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong pair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing the same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other intra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for intra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible loop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the pairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we present a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric monopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced in quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity superconductivity. In addition, we establish that the proposed pairing glue is measurable in the out-of-plane optical conductivity. In the last part, we reexamine the pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in light of recent experiments. By theoretically analyzing recent $T_c$ and elastocaloric measurements under uniaxial stress, we demonstrate that the pairing state includes $s$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, or body-centered $d_{xz} + i d_{yz}$ admixtures and that a bulk two-component superconductivity requires a great deal of fine-tuning to be consistent with ultrasound experiments.</p>

            <h2>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Qu, Zeying Zhang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic study of supercurrent diode effect in chiral nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Li, James Jun He</p>
            <p>Nonreciprocity of supercurrents may exist when both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries are broken, leading to the supercurrent diode effect (SDE). The spatial inversion symmetry may be broken by chiral structures in nanotubes where the SDE is expected when a magnetic flux passes through the tube. While such an effect has been predicted based on a phenomenological theory, a microscopic and quantitative study with a concrete lattice model is missing. Here, we investigate the SDE in chiral nanotubes made of carbon and those made of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) with tight-binding models. We obtain the SDE efficiency as a function of the nanotube radius, the chiral angle, the magnetic flux, the temperature, the chemical potential, etc., and find that sign flipping happens in various parameter dependencies. In TMD nanotubes, the SDEs with and without the spin-orbit coupling are compared. We also simulate CNTs made from square lattice materials for comparison and discuss the effects of strains. Besides qualitative consistency with previous phenomenological theory, new features are found and the microscopic origins are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Yue, Xiaohu Zheng, Chongli Yang, Kun Peng, Rui-Rui Du</p>
            <p>The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</p>

            <p>The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</p>

            <p>We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <p>The dynamical cavity method and its backtracking version provide a powerful approach to studying the properties of dynamical processes on large random graphs. This paper extends these methods to hypergraphs, enabling the analysis of interactions involving more than two variables. We apply them to analyse the $k$-XOR-satisfiability ($k$-XOR-SAT) problem, an important model in theoretical computer science which is closely related to the diluted $p$-spin model from statistical physics. In particular, we examine whether the quench dynamics -- a deterministic, locally greedy process -- can find solutions with only a few violated constraints on $d$-regular $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results demonstrate that the methods accurately characterize the attractors of the dynamics. It enables us to compute the energy reached by typical trajectories of the dynamical process in different parameter regimes. We show that these predictions are accurate, including cases where a classical mean-field approach fails.</p>

            <p>Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</p>

Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</p>

It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations.

            <p>The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</p>

            <h2>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</h2>

            <p>Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</p>

            <h2>Ghost Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Sellati, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The experimental measurement of collective charge fluctuations in metals and superconductors is a preferential tool to benchmark fundamental interactions in solids. Recent experiments in multicomponent systems, from superconducting layered cuprates to multiband metals, highlighted striking effects due to the interplay between different degrees of freedom. In this paper we provide a physical explanation for the existence of a "ghost" Josephson plasmon in bilayer superconductors, layered systems with two layers per unit cells that interact with two different Josephson couplings. We show that one of the two plasmons that emerge after the breaking of the translational symmetry along the out-of-plane direction is connected to counterflowing current fluctuations polarized perpendicularly to the planes. This effect makes it a staggered mode that is virtually transverse at small out-of-plane momenta qc, explaining why it is hidden in the density response at small qc. Our work offers an additional perspective on the understanding of collective excitations in systems with multiple intertwined degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</p>

            <p>The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shisheng Lin, Shaoqi Huang, Minhui Yang, Xin Chen, Hongjia Bi, Kangchen Xiong</p>
            <p>Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</p>

            <h2>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey C. Everts, Robert Hołyst, Karol Makuch</p>
            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

            <p>In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schlüter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</p>

            <p>Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</p>

Second by computing directly the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits. We end by discussing the advantages of splitting a CRN into smaller chemical modules.</p>

            <p>An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials, and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.</p>

In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</p>

            <p>The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <p>Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero \textit{net} transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Surprisingly, the vortices form \textit{nonlocally}; they are situated in between the inclusions. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the "magnetic memory effect" observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <p>It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</p>

            <p>Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</p>

            <h2>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra</p>
            <p>I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</p>

            <h2>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schrödinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Correlations, Spectra and Entaglement Transitions in Ensembles of Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Lóio, Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Guglielmo Lami, Jacopo De Nardis</p>
            <p>We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative Phase Transition in the Two-Photon Dicke Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aanal Jayesh Shah, Peter Kirton, Simone Felicetti, Hadiseh Alaeian</p>
            <p>We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation of the Dicke-Ising Model via Digital-Analog Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitriy S. Shapiro, Yannik Weber, Tim Bode, Frank K. Wilhelm, Dmitry Bagrets</p>
            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <h2>Braiding for the win: Harnessing braiding statistics in topological states to win quantum games</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Hart, David T. Stephen, Dominic J. Williamson, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</p>

            <p>Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</p>

            <h2>Aspect ratio controls hot-carrier generation in gold nanobricks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simão M.João, Ottavio Bassano, Johannes Lischner</p>
            <p>Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</p>

            <h2>Towards a mathematical framework for modelling cell fate dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sean T. Vittadello, Léo Diaz, Yujing Liu, Adriana Zanca, Michael P.H. Stumpf</p>
            <p>An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</p>
