            <h2>Exciton-polaritons and exciton localization from a first-principles interacting Green's function formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary N. Mauri, Christopher J. Ciccarino, Jonah B. Haber, Diana Y. Qiu, Felipe H. da Jornada</p>
            <p>Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Strain-Induced Pseudogauge Fields on Exciton Dispersion, Transport, and Interactions in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Heidari, Shervin Parsi, Pouyan Ghaemi</p>
            <p>We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in TMD-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Cooperativity on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Light-induced Spin-State Switching of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ Spin-Crossover Complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chetana Badala Viswanatha, Johannes Stöckl, Benito Arnoldi, Johannes Knippertz, Florian Haag, Hauke Paulsen, Juliusz A. Wolny, Martin Aeschlimann, Volker Schünemann, Benjamin Stadtmüller</p>
            <p>Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes. In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.</p>

            <h2>Nonresonant Casimir-Polder repulsion with a monolayer topological insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Sui Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable right-circularly polarized state of a two-level atomic system in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</p>

            <h2>Raman Circular Dichroism and Quantum Geometry of Chiral Quantum Spin Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduard Koller, Valentin Leeb, Natalia B. Perkins, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>We show that Raman circular dichroism (RCD) is a powerful probe of chiral quantum spin liquids (QSL) governed by the topology of fractionalized spin excitations. Starting from the Loudon-Fleury formalism of Mott insulators, we compute the RCD and demonstrate that it is identical to the result obtained from a direct light-matter coupling to effective spinon bands. The RCD signal originates from contributions of Berry curvature and quantum metric. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to two examples - the Kitaev honeycomb model in a magnetic field and a chiral $U(1)$ QSL on the triangular lattice - and discuss its experimental relevance for candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing Defect Complex Structures of PL6 in SiC: Insights from First-Principles Screening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Zhao, Mingzhe Liu, Chang-Kui Duan</p>
            <p>The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC has attracted significant research attention owing to its remarkable spin and optical properties at ambient temperatures. Unlike many color centers that require cryogenic conditions to function, the PL6 center maintains optical activity even at room temperature or higher, benefiting from the material's high thermal conductivity and chemical stability. To elucidate the origin of PL6's distinctive characteristics and clarify its microscopic structure in the crystal, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of potential defect complexes through systematic first-principles calculations. Our computational approach rigorously evaluates the electronic structures and spin-related properties of various defect configurations, enabling reasonable identification of the most probable atomic arrangement responsible for the observed characteristics of PL6. Our analysis identifies a limited set of candidate structures with ${\rm C_{3v}}$-like symmetry consistent with known experimental signatures. Among these, two defect complexes emerge as the most likely PL6 candidates. The findings suggest that targeted experimental studies, such as electron spin resonance and optically detected magnetic resonance, could further clarify the nature of the PL6 center, while additional theoretical investigations on transition matrix elements and defect formation dynamics are warranted.</p>

            <h2>Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn</p>
            <p>Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing Heat Transport in Crystalline Polymers in Real and Reciprocal Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Reicht, Lukas Legenstein, Sandro Wieser, Egbert Zojer</p>
            <p>Heat transport can be modelled with a variety of approaches in real space (using molecular dynamics) or in reciprocal space (using the Boltzmann transport equation). Employing two conceptually different approaches of each type, we study heat transport in crystalline polyethylene and polythiophene. We find that consistent results can be obtained when using highly efficient and accurate machine-learned potentials, provided that the physical intricacies of the considered materials and methods are correctly accounted for. For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.</p>

            <p>We systematically explore a pathway for generating nonlinear charge and spin photocurrents using spin-orbit-split surface states. This mechanism enables net charge and spin flow along the surface plane even in centrosymmetric bulk environments like the Rashba prototype Au(111), where we establish the key principles by combining model predictions with density functional calculations. We further identify the Tl/Si(111) surface, characterized by strong non-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, as a prime candidate for experimental validation; with slight doping, it develops metallic spin-orbit-split states featuring remarkable relativistic properties while the bulk remains semiconducting. Our non-linear simulations reveal distinct angular signatures and magnitudes comparable to bulk ferroelectrics, highlighting the potential of surface-state photocurrents for low-bias optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the intricate spin polarization of surface states opens new possibilities as a nonlinear spin filter, providing a far more versatile platform than the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Odd electrical circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry Walden, Alexander Stegmaier, Jörn Dunkel, Alexander Mietke</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions in elastic media give rise to rich non-equilibrium behaviors, but controllable experimental realizations of such odd elastic phenomena remain scarce. Building on recent breakthroughs in electrical analogs of non-Hermitian solid-state systems, we design and analyze scalable odd electrical circuits (OECs) as exact analogs of an odd solid. We show that electrical work can be extracted from OECs via cyclic excitations and trace the apparent energy gain back to active circuit elements. We show that OECs host oscillatory modes that resemble recent experimental observations in living chiral crystals and identify active resonances that reveal a perspective on odd elasticity as a mechanism for mechanical amplification.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated Frustration of Arrays with Four-Terminal Nb-Pt-Nb Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justus Teller, Christian Schäfer, Kristof Moors, Benjamin Bennemann, Matvey Lyatti, Florian Lentz, Detlev Grützmacher, Roman-Pascal Riwar, Thomas Schäpers</p>
            <p>We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per unit cell, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junctions array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junctions central weak link area.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary Rényi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Reshaping the Quantum Arrow of Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Pedro García-Pintos, Yi-Kai Liu, Alexey Gorshkov</p>
            <p>The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Eph-ephrin-mediated differential persistence as a mechanism for cell sorting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Bothe, Eloise Lardet, Alexei Poliakov, Gunnar Pruessner, Thibault Bertrand, Ignacio Bordeu</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.</p>

            <h2>Engineering anisotropic Dicke model with dipole-dipole interaction for Rydberg atom arrays in cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao-Yun Dong, Yanhua Zhou, Wei Wang, Tao Wang</p>
            <p>The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhou Xu, Antoine Maillard, Lenka Zdeborová, Florent Krzakala</p>
            <p>In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</p>

            <p>The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</p>

            <p>Chiral superconductivity exhibits the formation of novel electron pairs that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and has been actively studied in various quantum materials in recent years. However, despite its potential to provide definitive information, effects of disorder in the crystal structure on the chiral superconductivity has not yet been clarified, and therefore the investigation using a solid-solution system is desirable. We report muon-spin-relaxation (muSR) results of layered pnictide BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with a honeycomb network composed of Pt and (As, Sb). We observed an increase of the zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate in the superconducting (SC) state at the Sb end of x=1.0, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic field due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the SC state. On the other hand, spontaneous magnetic field was almost and completely suppressed for the As-Sb mixed samples of x=0.9 and 0.2, respectively, suggesting that the time-reversal symmetry breaking SC state in x=1.0 is sensitive to disorder. The magnetic penetration depth estimated from transverse-field muSR measurements at x=1.0 and 0.2 behaved like weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. These seemingly incompatible zero-field and transverse-field muSR results of BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with x=1.0 could be understood in terms of chiral d-wave superconductivity with point nodes on the three-dimensional Fermi surface.</p>

This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</p>

            <h2>Influence of oxygen orbitals and boundary conditions on the pairing behavior in the Emery model for doped ladders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gökmen Polat, Eric Jeckelmann (Institute of Theoretical Physics, Leibniz Universität Hannover)</p>
            <p>We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$</h2>

            <p>A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre A. Pantaleon, Zhen Zhan, Siddhartha E. Morales, Gerardo G. Naumis</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial band topology. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial band topology and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transition in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi</p>
            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. We theoretically prove the topological behavior and phase transition of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Also, Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term $(C_s=1$ and $C_v=0)$, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of non-trivial and trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</p>

            <h2>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Laura Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Munch, Barbara Wagner</p>
            <p>We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</p>

            <p>Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Lin Mai, Xiang-Yuan Cui, Tilmann Hickel, Jörg Neugebauer, Simon Ringer</p>
            <p>Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jennifer Coulter, Bogdan Rajkov, Michele Simoncelli</p>
            <p>Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</p>

            <p>We propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for a digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filling two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In such example we obtain fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable to study the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei I. Pavlov, Yuval Gefen, Alexander Shnirman</p>
            <p>Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</p>

            <p>A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wai-Keong Mok, Tobias Haug, Adam L. Shaw, Manuel Endres, John Preskill</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</p>

These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.</p>

            <p>Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahnaz Farhat, Denis Périce, Sören Petrat</p>
            <p>The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Yang, Gabriel Cardoso, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moiré bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.</p>

            <p>Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications. By expanding the family of 2D carbon materials, anthraphenylenes provide new avenues for functional nanomaterial design.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have attracted considerable interest due to their diverse structural and electronic properties, making them ideal for next-generation flat electronics. Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. These findings establish beta-naphthyne as a promising material for energy storage and optoelectronic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Dirac node pinning from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a Kagome spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ajesh Kumar, Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on the Kagome spin liquid candidate YCOB suggest the presence of Dirac fermionic spinons near the magnetization plateau at 1/9. Theories suggest that the spinons are charge neutral spin-$1/2$ excitations, in a $2\pi/3$ flux which triples the unit cell. Generally a gap is expected, and there is no symmetry protection for the Dirac nodes in this system. The question arises as to what causes the nodes and stabilizes them. In this work, we propose a node-creation and node-pinning mechanism driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Employing Gutzwiller-projected variational Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that DM interactions induce a band closing phase transition in the spinon spectrum. There is a change in the Chern number when the bands are inverted. Together with the DM-generated internal gauge flux, the coupling to the spinon orbital magnetization counteracts the band reopening. This interplay energetically pins the Dirac nodes over a range of parameters.</p>

            <h2>Quantum critical point followed by Kondo-like behavior due to Cu substitution in itinerant, antiferromagnet ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atreyee Das, Siham Mohamed, Raquel A. Ribeiro, Tyler J. Slade, Juan Schmidt, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield</p>
            <p>$\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ is an itinerant magnet with a small saturated moment of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu_{B}/\text{Ni}$ and a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_1$ = 61.0 K, $T_2$ = 56.5 K and $T_3$ = 42.2 K. Temperature and field dependent measurements suggest a complex, anisotropic $H-T$ phase diagram with multiple phase lines. Here we present the growth and characterization of single crystals of the ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ series for 0 $\leq x \leq$ 0.181. Using a suite of anisotropic magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements we study the evolution of the three AFM transitions upon Cu substitution. For ${0 \leq x \leq 0.097}$, the system remains magnetically ordered at base temperature with $x \leq$ 0.012, showing signs of three primarily AFM phases. For the higher substitution levels, ${0.125 \leq x \leq 0.181}$, there are no signatures of magnetic ordering, but an anomalous feature in resistance and heat capacity data are observed which are consistent with the Kondo effect in this system. The intermediate $x$ = 0.105 sample lies in between the magnetic ordered and the Kondo regime and is in the vicinity of the AFM-quantum critical point (QCP). Thus, ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ is an example of a small moment system that can be tuned through a QCP. Given these data combined with the fact that the $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ structure has kagome-like, Ni-sublattice running perpendicular to the crystallographic $c-$ axis, and a $3d$-electron flat band that contributes to the density of states near the Fermi energy, it becomes a promising candidate to host and study exotic physics.</p>

            <p>We present a combined density functional theory (DFT), one-step model of photoemission, and soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the quaternary borocarbide superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C.

We show that DFT and the full potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) with average Coulomb interaction U = 3.0 eV and the exchange energy J = 0.9 eV applied to the Ni d-states are necessary for reproducing the experimentally observed SX-ARPES spectra.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine A. Koch, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Martin Gomez-Dominguez, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Carlos Silva-Acuna, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada</p>
            <p>Exciton-exciton interactions are fundamental to the light-emitting properties of semiconductors, influencing applications from lasers to quantum light sources. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances with unique lattice coupling. Using three spectroscopic techniques - photoluminescence (PL) and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) - we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering a mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross-coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton-polarons within layered perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Igor Zutic</p>
            <p>Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Exchange-Coupled Spins for Robust High-Temperature Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Chakraborty, Md. Fahim F. Chowdhury, Mohamad Niknam, Louis S. Bouchard, Jayasimha Atulasimha</p>
            <p>We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (>1 K).</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive landscape and simple rules for transition-metal Heusler semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Zhang, Zirui Dong, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. To broaden the scope of Heusler semiconductors, advancements have been made in developing variants such as double-half Heuslers XX'Y2Z2 and quaternary full Heuslers XX'YZ, which incorporate four constituent elements. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 <= b <= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 <= a + b <= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Stefano Bosco</p>
            <p>Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth containing wide band gap oxides, which provide spin-photon interface and narrow linewidth optical emission, are getting significant attention as the most promising candidate materials in advancing quantum transduction and memories. Here, from $ab~initio$ calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic ground states in structurally preferred monoclinic CePO$_4$ and tetragonal CeVO$_4$ exhibiting localized occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states with $4f-4f$ transition characteristics. Interestingly, in CePO$_4$, O $2p$ and P $3p$ states hybridize negligibly with Ce $4f$ states, while in CeVO$_4$, V $3d$ and O $2p$ states hybridize and appear as extended states in between the occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states. Here, phonon calculations and analysis identify and differentiate Raman active phonon modes along with the spin phonon coupling of Ce in both CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$ that ultimately lead to different $4f$ ground state crystal field multiplets, which are critical to accurately describe electronic transitions for foundational quantum transduction and memories. Further, the identified $C_1$ site symmetry of Ce, lacking inversion symmetry in CePO$_4$, is relevant for quantum memories and $D_{2d}$ site symmetry of Ce exhibiting inversion symmetry in CeVO$_4$ is relevant for quantum transduction.</p>

            <p>The exploration of topological phases remains a cutting-edge research frontier, driven by their promising potential for next-generation electronic and quantum technologies. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling to systematically investigate the topological properties of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb Bi, HgTe, and Al2O3(0001)-supported HgTe. Remarkably, all three systems exhibit coexistence of first-order and higher-order topological insulator states, manifested by gapless edge states in one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons and symmetry-related corner states in zero-dimensional (0D) nanoflakes. Furthermore, fractional electron charges may accumulate at the corners of armchair-edged nanoflakes. Among these materials, HgTe/Al2O3(0001) is particularly promising due to its experimentally feasible atomic configuration and low-energy corner states. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring higher-order topological phases in Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators and pave the way for new possibilities in device applications.</p>

            <p>It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</p>

            <p>Beyond the study of individual materials, their interfaces and arising functionality are crucial enablers of fundamental science and technological applications. Recently, the arena of two-dimensional (2D) materials was extended to so-called non-van der Waals (non-vdW) compounds derived from strongly bonded non-layered bulk crystals. These nanosystems with their active surfaces complement now - through their chemically bonded heterostructure (HS) interfaces - the established space of weakly interacting vdW HSs. Here, we study a wide range of 55 candidate non-vdW HSs with autonomous density functional calculations and find that the resulting interfacial chemical hybridization and bonding is the key factor determining their electronic and magnetic properties. It gives rise to the formation of hybrid interface bands, strong magnetic coupling, and substantial electronic as well as magnetic moire surface property modulations upon twisting. Our work thus provides a significant step towards charting the new interface class of non-vdW HSs.</p>

            <p>Few concentrated disordered binary metallic alloys show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), which is quite unusual. V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ is one such alloy that shows resistivity exceeding 100 $\mu\Omega$ cm and exhibits negative TCR. The addition of ferromagnetic rare-earth Gd, which is insoluble in the body-centered cubic V-Ti matrix, changes the negative TCR to positive (when Gd conc. $\geq$ 2 at.$\%$). Evidence of spin polarization of conduction electrons of the V-Ti matrix by Gd clusters is obtained from the magnetization experiments as well as from the anomalous component of the Hall effect. Our analysis suggests that the additional scattering due to the distribution in the electron-spin fluctuation interaction arising from the substitution of titanium in vanadium is the origin of the negative TCR. The Gd clusters polarize the conduction electrons, leading to the suppression of spin fluctuations, resulting in the positive TCR.</p>

The phase space reconstruction relies on phase transitions derived from the Luttinger-Ward functional, which accounts for interactions that are forbidden by perturbation theory.

            <p>Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</p>

            <p>The structural and physical properties of two single-grain Au-Al-Gd 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with analyzed compositions Au73.67Al12.24Gd14.09 and Au74.67Al11.35Gd13.98 were thoroughly investigated. The two variants are iso-structural (cubic, space group: Im-3 undergoing sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 9.6 K and TN = 8.3 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements in both samples evidenced sharp jump at TN, associated with the AFM transition, accompanied by broad Schottky-type anomalies at lower temperatures. Strikingly, the two 1/1 ACs exhibited markedly different responses to applied magnetic fields: one displayed a pronounced metamagnetic anomaly while the other did not. In this regard, variational calculations with adiabatic transformation of the magnetic field in realistic structural models identified the existence of two possible AFM phases: the cuboc phase with a metamagnetic anomaly and the cluster Néel phase without it, thereby clearly revealing the possible magnetic structures of the present AFM variants. These findings have led to the establishment of a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram for Heisenberg-type 1/1 ACs. This work not only advances our understanding of magnetic phase transitions in these complex systems but also suggests the existence of a broader spectrum of unexplored magnetic states in Tsai-type materials.</p>

            <p>The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</p>

            <p>We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks--Chandler--Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation.

            <h2>Reduction of current for magnetization switching in a nanomagnet with perpendicular anisotropy by spin-splitter torque</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Watanabe, Keisuke Yamada, Yoshinobu Nakatani</p>
            <p>Recently, spin-transfer torque (STT) based magnetization switching has been widely utilized in magnetic resistance-based memories, which have broad applications in microcontroller units and other devices. This study utilizes a macrospin model to simulate magnetization switching in nanoscale magnets with perpendicular anisotropy through spin-splitter torque (SST). The study primarily addresses minimizing the current for magnetization switching and identifying the conditions necessary for achieving high switching probabilities. Notably, the threshold current density for SST-induced magnetization switching is reduced by approximately 75-80% compared to conventional STT and spin-orbit torque mechanisms, provided the spin torque polar angle is optimized. For practical implementation in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), a polar angle exceeding roughly 128 degrees must be maintained to ensure sufficient switching probability. Additionally, optimizing the shape of the applied current pulse significantly lowers the switching per rate by approximately 18 times. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SST in reducing magnetization switching currents and offer valuable insights into its potential application in SST-MRAM technology.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocity and multibody interactions in acoustically levitated particle systems: A three body problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brady Wu, Qinghao Mao, Bryan VanSaders, Heinrich M. Jaeger</p>
            <p>In active fluids and active solids the constituents individually generate movement by each extracting energy from their environment or from their own source. Non-reciprocal interactions among these active constituents then enable novel collective behavior that often can be strikingly counterintuitive. However, non-reciprocity in these cases typically requires that the interacting bodies have different physical properties or it needs to be programmed explicitly into all pairwise interactions. Here we show that collective activity in a driven system can emerge spontaneously through multibody nonreciprocal forces, even if all bodies are individually non-active and have identical properties. We demonstrate this with as few as three identical spheres, acoustically levitated in air, which exhibit collective activity as they interact through non-pairwise forces: similar to the classic gravitational three-body problem, the interaction between two spheres depends sensitively on the relative position of the third sphere. Non-reciprocity arises naturally from both near-field sound scattering and microstreaming forces among the spheres. The underdamped dynamics in air furthermore make it possible to go beyond collective center-of-mass propulsion or rotation and observe internal, engine-like reconfigurations that follow limit cycles. These findings open up new possibilities for self-assembly, where now multibody interactions not only determine the resulting structure but also drive the spontaneously emerging dynamics.</p>

            <p>Owing to the intrinsically high crystallization temperatures, layered phase-change materials, such as CrGeTe3 and InGeTe3, are attracting attention for embedded memory applications, In addition to the electrical contrast, a major change in magnetic properties is observed in CrGeTe3 upon switching from the crystalline to the amorphous state. In this work, we report a combined ab initio modeling and magnetic characterization study on the isostructural silicon parent compound of CrGeTe3, namely, CrSiTe3. Amorphous CrSiTe3 has similar structural properties to amorphous CrGeTe3; however, it shows a smaller energy difference between the ferromagnetic configuration and the random magnetic configuration, indicating a high probability of spin glass formation. Indeed, direct-current and alternating-current magnetic measurements show that the coercive force of amorphous CrSiTe3 is higher than that of amorphous CrGeTe3. Therefore, the pinning effect of spins is enhanced in amorphous CrSiTe3, leading to a more robust spin glass state with a higher freezing temperature. The large magnetic contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phase could make CrSiTe3 a potential candidate for phase-change magnetic switching applications.</p>

            <h2>Stability of quasi-particle creation and multiband geometry in fractional Chern insulators under magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nozomi Higashino, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing magnetization, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. Upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE significantly increases and exceeds the conventional limits of AHE of intrinsic origin. Additionally, we observe a topological Hall effect (THE) that emerges in the conical magnetic phase. Notably, the THE in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ persists over an extended magnetic field range of up to 25~T. Our detailed transport measurements highlight the need for theoretical modeling to explain the observations of AHE and THE in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$= Rare earth) family of compounds.</p>

            <h2>A Bond weighted tensor renormalization group study of the q-state ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Heng Tseng, Shang-Wei Li, Fu-Jiun Jiang</p>
            <p>It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.</p>

            <p>The frustrated honeycomb spin model can stabilize a subextensively degenerate spiral spin liquid with nontrivial topological excitations and defects, but its material realization remains rare. Here, we report the experimental realization of this model in the structurally disorder-free compound GdZnPO. Using a single-crystal sample, we find that spin-7/2 rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ ions form a honeycomb lattice with dominant second-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic and first-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, along with easy-plane single-site anisotropy. This frustrated model stabilizes a unique spiral spin liquid with a degenerate contour around the $\mathrm{K}$$\{$1/3,1/3$\}$ point in reciprocal space, consistent with our experiments down to 30 mK, including the observation of a giant residual specific heat. Our results establish GdZnPO as an ideal platform for exploring the stability of spiral spin liquids and their novel properties, such as the emergence of low-energy topological defects on the sublattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin</p>
            <p>Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have a wide prospect of applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, materials, etc. However, 2D transition metal nitrides with strong magnetism, especially high N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature, are very scarce. Based on the first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory, we design two 2D transition-metal nitrides \textit{M}$_2$N$_2$ (\textit{M} = Ti, Co), in which the transition metal atoms and the N atoms form a 2D layer with a wrinkled structure. The structural stability is demonstrated by the cohesive energy, formation energy, elastic constants, phonon spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. Elastic moduli calculations reveal that the mechanical properties of the two structures are anisotropic. Spin-polarized calculations show that Ti$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D ferromagnetic material while Co$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D antiferromagnetic semimetal with a Dirac point at Fermi level. Furthermore, by solveing the Heisenberg model by Monte Carlo method, we discover that the 2D Co$_2$N$_2$ layer is a high-temperature antiferromagnetic material and the N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature is up to 474 K. Therefore, our findings provide a rare antiferromagnetic 2D material with both high critical temperature and Dirac Fermions.</p>

The width of the domain wall is a non-monotonic function of the velocity and it diverges to infinity at $v_c$. Both features are in contrast to the case of the Lorentz invariant model in the absence of the field. We further study the modification of the wall profile when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is added. Finally, we present a propagating spiral expected to form when the system is forced at a velocity higher than the maximum velocity for domain walls and we give numerical results for the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</p>

            <p>Point defects, though atomically small, significantly influence the properties of 2D materials. A general method for characterizing point defect density ($n_{ D }$) in graphenic materials with arbitrary layer number ($n_{ L }$) is currently lacking. Here, we introduce the Graphene Atlas, a non-destructive Raman spectroscopy-based framework for defect quantification in diverse graphenic systems. We demonstrate that the relative fractions of the double-resonance D and 2D Raman bands, which arise from competing scattering processes, exhibit a universal relationship with $n_{ D }$, independent of $n_{ L }$. Plotting Raman data on a plane defined by defect-related and layer number-related parameters enables a direct and quantitative determination of $n_{ D }$ and $n_{ L }$. This Graphene Atlas provides a transformative tool for real-time defect quantification in scalable manufacturing of graphenic materials, bridging fundamental research and industrial applications. This framework establishes a new standard for defect characterization of graphenic systems, facilitating their optimization for advanced technological applications.</p>

This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingze Su, Ruitao Xiao, Junnian Xiong, Hui Li, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li</p>
            <p>In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.</p>

            <p>Copper and hydrogen are among the most common elements that are widely used in industrial and fundamental research applications. Copper surfaces are often exposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can accelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below the surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can lead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the naked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface. Blisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties of the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using scanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated polycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence. Initially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our experiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to blistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it. Moreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with specific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic simulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific behavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our simulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on surfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence of the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in copper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.</p>

            <p>Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</p>

In the creep layer, $\alpha$ decreases with depth, reaching $\alpha \approx -1.5$ at approximately 55 mean particle diameters, consistent with the SOC model with closed boundaries ($\alpha \approx -1.58$). Analysis of the fluctuation velocity distributions offers additional insights into the microscopic origins of the spectrum's characteristics.

            <p>The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J >0$ and $J' >0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer new perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Impact and spreading dynamics of a drop of fiber suspension on a solid substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeram Rajesh, Alban Sauret</p>
            <p>The presence of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a liquid modifies the impact and spreading dynamics of a drop on a hydrophilic substrate. This difference in spreading dynamics is attributed to the increase in the suspension's viscosity caused by the particles. Similarly, anisotropic non-Brownian particles, such as fibers, also increase the bulk viscosity. In addition to the fiber diameter, D, the length, L, which determines the aspect ratio A = L/D, is crucial in controlling the fiber suspension viscosity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drop impact of fiber suspensions with different volume fractions will result in a similar modification of the spreading dynamics. To investigate the impact and spreading dynamics, we prepared suspensions of fibers with an aspect ratio A = 12 at different volume fractions, spanning the dilute, semi-dilute, and dense concentration regimes. Additionally, we conducted a subset of experiments with aspect ratios A = 4 and A = 20. Furthermore, we characterized the thickness of the resulting droplet film (the coating) and the orientation of fibers after the spreading dynamics reached a steady state. The presence of fibers results in a decrease in the final droplet size, as an increase in volume fraction leads to an increase in the suspension viscosity. To rationalize these results, we used a modified equation, originally developed for spherical particles, which incorporates the suspension viscosity. Furthermore, we observed that volume fraction plays only a weak role in controlling splashing. However, it is crucial in determining the final thickness and resulting fiber coating. We also used a novel approach to quantify the final fiber orientation and showed that the resulting distribution is anisotropic within the quantified range.</p>

Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature.

            <h2>Velocity gauge formulation of nonlinear optical response in Floquet-driven systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Sajad Dabiri, Reza Asgari</p>
            <p>Using the velocity gauge formalism, we develop a theoretical framework for computing the nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. This approach complements the length gauge formulation and offers distinct advantages in both numerical and analytical treatments, particularly for atomic and solid-state systems with well-defined momentum-space structures. By applying our framework to the Rabi model, we derive numerical solutions in the velocity gauge and compare them with the length gauge, demonstrating full agreement between the two formulations. Our findings reveal rich optical phenomena, including photon-assisted transitions, frequency mixing effects, and emergent Floquet-induced photocurrents that are absent in static systems. We demonstrate that nonlinear responses in Floquet-driven systems exhibit resonances at integer multiples of the driving frequency, providing insights into ultrafast spectroscopy and Floquet engineering of quantum materials. The present formulation establishes a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in driven quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum optics, photonics, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by experiments on rhombohedral tetralayer graphene showing signs of superconductivity emerging from a valley-polarized normal state, we here analyze theoretically how scanning tunneling spectroscopy can be used to probe the superconducting order parameter of the system. To describe different pairing scenarios on equal footing, we develop a microscopic tunneling approach that can capture arbitrary, including finite-momentum, superconducting order parameters and low-symmetry normal-state Hamiltonians. Our analysis shows that the broken time-reversal symmetry in a single valley leads to unique features in the weak-tunneling regime that are different for commensurate and incommensurate Cooper pair momenta. We further uncover an unconventional spatial dependence of the Andreev conductance, allowing to distinguish between three topologically distinct classes of single-$\mathbf{q}$ pairing states in the system, and compute the signatures of a competing translational-symmetry breaking three-$\mathbf{q}$ ''moiré superconductor''.</p>

            <p>We evaluate theoretically the possibility to realize Majorana zero modes in hybrid devices made from topological-insulator (TI) nanowires proximity-coupled to a superconductor. Such systems have been suggested as building blocks of future topological quantum computers, as they have been predicted to realize Majorana zero modes protected by large gaps. A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.</p>

            <h2>Shear jamming transition in alternating shear rotation for frictional and frictionless suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pappu Acharya, Martin Trulsson</p>
            <p>Alternating shear rotations in dense suspensions have recently shown the ability to reduce both viscosity and dissipation per strain (at a fixed global shear rate). Here, we study alternating shear rotation, with extensive numerical simulations, at various angles and up to their corresponding jamming points. For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is continuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles, while it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the alternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for suspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual contributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted for this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact stress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite trend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress will dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation increases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a one-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total stress for both frictionless and frictional particles.</p>

            <p>Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</p>

            <h2>Random motility regulation drives the fragmentation of microbial ecosystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Dinelli, Ada Altieri, Julien Tailleur</p>
            <p>The self-organization of microbial ecosystems involves a large variety of mechanisms, ranging from biochemical signaling to population dynamics. Among these, the role of motility regulation has been little studied, despite the importance of active migration processes. Here we show how weak, random motility regulation generically induces the fragmentation of bacterial ecosystems comprising a large number of coexisting strains. To do so, we simulate microscopic models of run-and-tumble bacteria whose self-propulsion speeds are regulated by the local density of each strain. Our simulations reveal that, as the heterogeneity of the interaction network increases, the ecosystem undergoes a phase transition leading to the emergence of distinct communities. To account for these results and assess their robustness, we use random-matrix theory to analyze the hydrodynamic description of the bacterial ecosystem, obtaining a quantitative agreement with our microscopic simulations. Our results are shown to hold for a variety of motility-regulation mechanisms and should be relevant to the study of community formation by motile organisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <p>The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module this http URL is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Daniel E. Parker, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</p>

            <p>As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (>2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</p>

            <p>The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.</p>

Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS),were understood to be related to these deep states.

CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with $Pnma$ space group, featuring chains of edge-shared CoO$_6$ octahedra arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Two antiferromagnetic transitions are observed at $T$$_{N1}$ = 14.4 K and $T$$_{N2}$ = 16.2 K, corresponding to two long-range magnetic orders with propagation vectors of $\bf{k}$$_1$ = (0, 0, 0) and $\bf{k}$$_2$ = (0.125, 0, 0.25), respectively. The ground state is determined as a canted up-up-down-down zigzag spin configuration along the $c$ axis, wherein the magnetic moments of Co1 and Co2 ions are 3.4(1) and 2.1(1)$\mu$$_B$, respectively. Successive spin-flop transitions appear with the increasing magnetic field applied along the easy axis ($c$ axis), accompanied by depression of the antiferromagnetic orders and enhancement of residual magnetic entropy. The field-induced spin-disordered state suggests that CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ may be an ideal candidate for studying frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p>Theoretically, the relative change of the Heisenberg-type nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor coupling $J_2$ in the face-centered-cubic lattice can give rise to three main antiferromagnetic orderings of type-I, type-II, and type-III. However, it is difficult to tune the $J_2/J_1$ ratio in real materials. Here, we report studies on the influence of Te$^{6+}$ and W$^{6+}$ ions replacement to the magnetic interactions and the magnetic ground states in the double-perovskite compounds Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co). For Ba$_2$MnTe$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$, the W$^{6+}$ doping on Te$^{6+}$ site is successful in $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.9$ with short-range orders of the type-I ($0.02 \leq x \leq 0.08$) and type-II ($0.1 \leq x \leq 0.9$). In Ba$_2$CoTe$_{1-x}$W${_x}$O$_6$, x-ray diffraction measurements reveal two crystal structures, including the trigonal phase ($0 \leq x \leq 0.1$) and the cubic phase ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1$), between which is a miscibility gap. Two magnetic transitions are identified in the trigonal phase due to two magnetic subsystems, and the type-II magnetic order is observed in the cubic phase. Magnetic phase diagrams of Ba$_2M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co) are established. Our work shows that the magnetic interactions and ground states of Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ can be tuned effectively by the replacement of Te$^{6+}$ by W$^{6+}$ ions.</p>

This suggests that below the CDW transition temperature, the correlation between localized spins may develop at both ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$.

In this work, we consider finite-time feedback processes in classical discrete systems described by Markov jump processes, and derive achievable bounds on entropy production for feedback processes controlled by Maxwell's demons. The key ingredients of our approach is optimal transport theory and an achievable Fano's inequality, by which we optimize the Wasserstein distance over final distributions under fixed consumed information. Our study reveals the minimum entropy production for consuming a certain amount of information, and moreover, the optimal feedback protocol to achieve it. These results are expected to lead to design principles for information processing in various stochastic systems with discrete states.</p>

            <h2>Edge dependence of the Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seong Jang, Geon-Hyoung Park, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gil-Ho Lee</p>
            <p>The observation of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime has attracted considerable attention, revealing the coexistence of two seemingly incompatible phases: the quantum Hall and superconducting states. However, the mechanism underlying the Josephson current remains unclear because of the observed h/2e magnetic interference period and the lack of precisely quantized Hall plateaus. To address this issue, we investigate the edge dependence of the Josephson current in graphene Josephson junctions operating in the quantum Hall regime. By systematically comparing devices with native, etched, edge-free, and gate-defined edges, we demonstrate that the Josephson current is confined to the physical edges and is highly sensitive to specific edge configurations. Our findings provide direct evidence that counter-propagating quantum Hall edge states mediate Andreev bound states, enabling Josephson coupling. These results clarify the underlying mechanism of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime and offer new strategies for engineering superconducting hybrid devices.</p>

            <h2>Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle</h2>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</p>

            <p>Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. Here, we introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize the designability of floppy chains and frustrated loops to demonstrate matrix-vector multiplication in materia.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Masaoka, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe</p>
            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

            <p>PrAlSi, a non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal candidate with a Curie temperature of 17.8K, offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry breaking and topological electronic structures. Up to now, the Weyl fermion distribution as well as their evolution across the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in PrAlSi has not been explored. Here, we uncover the presence of Weyl fermions in PrAlSi and demonstrate they could be manipulated through the magnetic phase transition. Our ab-initio calculations indicate a shift in the momentum and energy positions of Weyl fermions, alongside an increase in Weyl point numbers due to band splitting. The predicted band splitting and shifting of Weyl fermions are corroborated by our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. Such manipulation of Weyl fermions leads to the appearance of a net chirality charge and a significant modulation in optical conductivity, as proposed by our calculations. Our research presents a novel method for adjusting the properties of Weyl semimetals by controlling Weyl fermions through magnetic phase transitions, positioning PrAlSi as a model system.</p>

            <p>Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$-300meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent studies of the cluster Mott insulator candidate compound Nb3Cl8, this study performs 93Nb and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to investigate the electron correlations. Below the structural transition temperature Ts ~ 97 K, all satellites of the 93Nb NMR spectra split into three distinct peaks, which suggests symmetry lowering due to the structural transition and could be attributed to the change in the Nb-Nb bond-lengths of the Nb3 clusters. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 divided by the temperature T, 1/T1T, increases upon cooling to Ts for all Cl sites, whereas only the Knight shift K of Cl located at the center of the Nb3 clusters exhibits a temperature dependence similar to that observed in magnetic susceptibility. These findings collectively demonstrate the existence of strong spin correlations between the Nb atoms in Nb3Cl8, which are closely associated with Mottness.</p>

            <h2>Chiral magnon splitting in altermagnetic CrSb from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Zhang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Ke Chen, Kun Cao</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has been proposed as a new type of magnetism, simultaneously exhibiting compensated spin moments in real space and spin-split electronic bands in reciprocal space. Alternating chiral magnon splitting is considered a unique feature of altermagnets. In this work, utilizing linear spin wave theory (LSWT), which is based on a localized spin picture and itinerant time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TD-DFPT), we investigate the spin fluctuation spectra of altermagnetic CrSb. Along the L-$\Gamma$-L$^{\prime}$ path, the LSWT provides a chiral magnon splitting of up to 9 meV, located at high excitation energies around 140 meV, which is identified to be primarily driven by the splitting of two long-range exchange interactions, with exchange paths along the body diagonal lines of the unit cell. On the other hand, the more realistic TD-DFPT obtains more significant splitting of $\sim$ 30 meV at maximum. However, the splitting is severely smeared out due to strong Landau damping from the Stoner continuum, which may make it difficult to observe experimentally, e.g. through inelastic neutron scattering. We further provide a brief discussion on the connection between the Stoner excitations and the chiral magnon splitting.</p>

            <h2>Unified mechanism of charge-density-wave and high-$T_c$ superconductivity protected from oxygen vacancies in bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daisuke Inoue, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Unconventional charge and spin density-wave states are commonly observed in bilayer nickelates, drawing considerable attention due to their proximity to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in various phase diagrams. However, the nature and mechanisms of charge and spin density-waves (DWs) in nickelates remain poorly understood. Numerous experiments have reported that the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition temperature $T_{ cdw}$ and the spin-density-wave (SDW) transition temperature $T_{sdw}$ are closely related but distinct. However, in contrast to these experiments, previous mean-field-type analyses have yielded only a simple SDW phase. To resolve this key problem, this paper demonstrates that sizable CDW instabilities emerge in proportion to the SDW instability in La$3$Ni$2$O$7$.This behavior is driven by the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism, which captures important electron correlations beyond mean-field theory. Therefore, (i) experimental CDW + SDW coexisting state is naturally explained. In addition, (ii) the CDW + SDW fluctuations cooperatively drive high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Notably, the predicted $s$-wave SC state is robust against the inner apical O vacancies. Furthermore, (iii) the CDW instability is highly sensitive to the size of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital hole pocket, allowing for the realization of CDW quantum criticality through carrier-doping and pressure application. We find that the coexistence of charge and spin fluctuations is essential in bilayer nickelates, with both playing a cooperative role in mediating high-$T_c$ superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Patil, Owen Benton</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</p>

            <h2>Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Taniguchi</p>
            <p>Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.</p>

            <p>The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.</p>

            <p>Interfacing complex oxides in atomically engineered layered structures can give rise to a wealth of exceptional electronic and magnetic properties that surpass those of the individual building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic spin order with a high Curie temperature of 608 K in superlattices consisting of otherwise paramagnetic perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) and antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 (LFO). The extraordinary ferromagnetism likely results from the covalent exchange due to interfacial charge transfer from Fe to Ni cations. By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus the amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for a stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO, an emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential for the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as well as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.</p>

            <p>Accurately determining the coupling strength between polaron states is essential to describe charge-hopping transport in materials. In this work, we revisit methodologies to extract coupling strengths using ab initio approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of incorporating anharmonic effects in the model Hamiltonian when analyzing total energy variations along reaction coordinates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling strength extraction based on total energy calculated from ab initio approaches is fundamentally limited due to the stabilization of diabatic states, which do not involve coupling strength. We demonstrate that such limitation exists in both DFT+U and HSE hybrid functionals, which are widely used in the study of polaron transport. Instead, we suggest extracting coupling strength directly from the electronic structure of a system in neutral conditions. The neutral condition avoids overestimating coupling strength due to additional energy splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states from the charging energy. This study highlights the limitations of existing methods and introduces a robust framework for accurately extracting coupling parameters, paving the way for improved modeling of charge transport in complex materials.</p>

            <p>Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic conductors with suitably broken spatial symmetries host spin-polarized bands, which lead to transport phenomena commonly observed in metallic ferromagnets. In bulk materials, it is the given crystalline structure that determines whether symmetries are broken and spin-polarized bands are present. Here we demonstrate experimentally that double-gate transistors realized on bilayers of van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4 allow the relevant symmetry to be controlled by a perpendicular electric displacement field. Such a level of control enables the spin-polarization of the conduction band to be switched on and off. Because conduction band states with opposite spin-polarizations are hosted in the different layers and are spatially separated, these devices also give control over the magnetization of the electrons that are accumulated electrostatically. Our experiments show that double-gated CrPS4 transistors provide a viable platform to create gate-induced conductors with near unity spin polarization at the Fermi level, as well as devices with a full electrostatic control of the total magnetization of the system.</p>

            <p>Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</p>

            <p>The mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional materials has sparked significant interest in the study of low-dimensional structures. In this work, we investigate the bulk and low-dimensional derivatives of BiSeI, a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic crystal known for its remarkable stability and novel electronic properties. Using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we examine the influence of dimensionality on their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties. Quasi-particle $\mathit{G_0W_0}$ calculations reveal a significant increase in the band gap with a decrease in dimensionality, driven by quantum confinement effects and reduced dielectric screening. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we identify a transition from weakly bound Wannier-Mott excitons in bulk BiSeI to strongly bound excitons its low-dimensional forms. These structures feature band gaps spanning the infrared to the visible spectrum and exhibit large exciton binding energies, making them promising for next-generation optoelectronics and excitonic applications. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for future experimental studies on BiSeI and its low-dimensional counterparts.</p>

However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</p>

            <h2>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring novel phases in transverse field Ising chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davood Marripour, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Engineering tunable fractional Shapiro steps in colloidal transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andris P. Stikuts, Seemant Mishra, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass, Pietro Tierno</p>
            <p>Shapiro steps are quantized plateaus in the velocity-force or velocity-torque curve of a driven system, when its speed remains constant despite an increase in the driving force. For microscopic particles driven across a sinusoidal potential, integer Shapiro steps have been observed. By driving a single colloidal particle across a time-modulated, non-sinusoidal periodic optical landscape, we here demonstrate that fractional Shapiro steps emerge in addition to integer ones. Measuring the particle position via individual particle tracking, we reveal the underlying microscopic mechanisms that produce integer and fractional steps and demonstrate how these steps can be controlled by tuning the shape and driving protocol of the optical potential. The flexibility offered by optical engineering allows us to generate wide ranges of potential shapes and to study, at the single-particle level, synchronization behavior in driven soft condensed matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials</h2>

            <p>Accurately predicting the voltage of battery materials is essential for advancing energy storage technologies and designing more efficient, high-performance batteries. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the average voltage of materials used in Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from the Materials Project, incorporating a diverse set of features, including structural, physical, chemical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties, along with battery-specific descriptors. These features were utilized to construct a robust DNN model aimed at facilitating the discovery of novel battery materials. The model performance evaluated through 10-fold cross validation achieving an R$^2$ value of 0.99 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.069 V on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability to capture the complex relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that machine learning approaches, particularly DNN models, can provide rapid and reliable voltage predictions without relying on computationally expensive first-principles calculations. This research shows how systematic data analysis can accelerate the identification and improvement of next-generation battery materials. By focusing on key material properties and using computational methods, our study lays the groundwork for faster development of new energy storage solutions.</p>

            <p>We present an algorithm that integrates pseudosymmetry search with first-principles calculations to systematically identify achiral parent structures and establish potential chiral displacive transitions linking them to their corresponding chiral phases within the 22 enantiomorphic space groups. This approach enables a robust exploration of structural relationships, offering new insights into symmetry-driven properties. Our workflow streamlines the discovery of displacive chiral phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes, providing insights into the mechanisms of structural chirality in inorganic materials. We apply this methodology on the chiral phases of TeO$_2$, Na$_2$SeO$_9$, Sr$_2$As$_2$O$_7$, As$_2$O$_5$, Rb$_2$Be$_2$O$_3$, and CaTe$_2$O$_3$. Demonstrating that some do not have a minimal supergroup that allows for an achiral phase; some can have a minimal supergroup, still, no unstable phonon mode exists in the achiral phase; and somewhere the minimal supergroup exists with a soft phonon mode connecting the identified achiral phase and the chiral phase through small continuous displacements.</p>

            <h2>Drivers of chemical diffusion of hydrogen in the thin transition metallic glass V80Zr20</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Spode, Ola Hartmann, Gunnar Karl Pálsson</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical transmission to determine concentration-dependent hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energies of thin metallic glass films over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations. The hydrogen concentration's temporal and spatial profiles are simultaneously extracted without requiring a metal-insulator transition or hydride formation. The concentration-dependent activation energy is extracted and is found to exhibit similar concentration dependence as hydrogen in the disordered bulk alpha-phase of vanadium. The activation energy is in stark contrast, however, to the activation energy found in epitaxial vanadium films of similar thickness. The chemical diffusion increases with hydrogen concentration in the glass, whereas it decreases in the crystalline case owing to the differences in the thermodynamic factors. This technique provides detailed insight into the concentration dependence of hydrogen diffusion and constrains theories treating correlated motion of hydrogen and short-range hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. The method can be applied to other materials that show an optical response to hydrogen uptake.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu</p>
            <p>Targeting the key issue of the microscopic mechanism for high-T$_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates and following the principle of "exploring the pairing mechanism of electrons by tracing their migration and gathering", we propose a new idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the local e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, based on the strong ionic bonding and the strong attraction of the oxygen nuclei to electrons, which clarifies numerous experimental puzzles. The Cooper-pair wavefunction and its typical characteristics are given. It is this universal picture, confirmed through diverse experimental evidence, most notably the STM tunneling constant-current image on the CuO$_2$ plane combining with the ultra-small Cooper-pair size as an ironclad proof, that determines the unconventional high-T$_c$ superconductivity of oxide superconductors. According to our e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, the room-temperature electron (hole) pairing can be realized in ionic oxides, laying a key foundation for achieving the room-temperature superconductivity, and bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductors one step closer.</p>

            <p>Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate three-body loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic materials. Here, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The x-direction component of SC component is observed to have an ferroicity-driven switch. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Gate electrode-induced nonreciprocal resistance in topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofie Kölling, Florian R. Westerhof, Alexander Brinkman</p>
            <p>A common method of controlling the chemical potential in topological insulators is applying a gate electrode. Simultaneously applying high source-drain bias currents can lead to parasitic effects in such devices. We derive that these parasitic effects lead to a gradient in the Hall effect along the current lead of a Hall bar. Consequently, nonreciprocal effects in both longitudinal and Hall voltages appear upon reversing the bias. These effects scale similarly to the magnetochiral anisotropy, requiring detailed analysis to make a distinction. Experimentally we show that nonreciprocal effects can appear in materials where magnetochiral anisotropy is not expected while a top gate is present. Without gate electrode, this nonreciprocal effect is found to be absent. These results show the importance of considering and, if possible, excluding gate electrode-induced effects when searching for nonreciprocal resistance intrinsic to a material.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Disorder on the Energy Landscape and Motional Mechanisms Involved in Lithium Ion Dynamics and Transport in Solid Electrolytes: Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Argyrodite as a Case Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ali Badragheh, Vanessa Miß, Bernhard Roling, Michael Vogel</p>
            <p>7Li NMR diffusometry and relaxometry are combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to compare the mechanisms for the dynamics and transport of lithium ions in disordered and crystalline electrolytes with argyrodite composition Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. The dc conductivity of a disordered sample prepared by ball milling amounts to 0.76 mScm-1 at room temperature, which is substantially lower than that of two previously studied crystalline argyrodites differing in the order of the anion sublattice due to various heat treatments. However, the activation energy of the dc conductivity is smaller for ball-milled disordered Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (E_dc= 0.35 eV) than for both crystalline compounds (E_dc= 0.38 eV). 7Li NMR field-gradient measurements of the self-diffusion coefficient D and its activation energy E_D confirm these findings and, furthermore, reveal different Haven ratios. 7Li NMR field-cycling relaxometry shows that the lithium ion jumps in ball-milled Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 are described by very broad dynamical susceptibilities arising from a temperature-independent Gaussian-like distribution of activation energies g(E_a) with a mean value of E_m= 0.43 eV, while the susceptibilities indicated a high-energy cutoff for the crystalline electrolytes. Based on different relations between the activation energies for the conductivity, diffusivity and jumps, we discuss that the shape and exploration of the energy landscapes of ball-milled and crystalline Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 samples strongly differ. Moreover, significant differences in the preexponential factor of the dc conductivity, the Haven ratio and the single-particle correlation factor point to distinct types of anion lattice disorder of the ball-milled disordered and heat-treated crystalline samples.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe$_2$ have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic fields.</p>

We provide realistic parameters for observing the negative currents in an experiment and show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Cameron, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer high efficiency and low costs, making them key for future photovoltaics. Optimizing charge transport layers is crucial, with porous TiO$_2$ widely used as electron transport layers (ETL) due to its energy alignment, transparency, and abundance. However, its efficiency relies on crystallinity requiring high-temperature processing (>450$^\circ$C), increasing costs and limiting flexible substrates. Low-temperature wet-chemical methods face scalability issues due to material waste and hazardous solvents. In this context, plasma-based technologies are emerging as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to oxide-based ETLs. This study presents the synthesis of TiO$_2$ layers using an advanced plasma method combining remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) and soft plasma etching (SPE) at mild temperatures (<200$^\circ$C), allowing control of microstructure and porosity. The resulting nanocolumnar film, decorated with a highly porous aerogel-like layer, enhances optical and electronic properties. These plasma-synthesized TiO$_2$ layers are antireflective and improve the efficiency in porous n-i-p PSCs, matching the performance of high-temperature reference cells. These PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 14.6%, a high value compared to reference devices synthesized at 450°C. Impedance spectroscopy confirms high recombination resistance and stable capacitance, linked to improved perovskite crystallinity. Our results highlight the potential of the RPAVD+SPE approach for producing low-temperature efficient ETLs, providing a feasible, industrially scalable, and eco-friendly alternative for manufacturing flexible, high-performance photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuechen Wang, Yaxin Gao, Menghao Wu</p>
            <p>The ion conductivity of a solid-state ion conductor generally increases exponentially upon reduction in ion migration barrier. For prevalent cathode material LiCoO2, the room-temperature ion conductivity and migration barrier are respectively around 10-4 S/cm and 0.3 eV. In this paper, through first-principles calculations we predict the existence of 1D superionicity as the Li ions in O2 LiCoO2 are transformed to Zn0.5CoO2 or Li0.5CoO2 via cation-exchange reaction or deintercalation. The ion migration barriers (0.01-0.02 eV) even lower than room-temperature ~kBT are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with LiCoO2, which are facilitated by facile transition of mobile ions between two coordination configurations. The room-temperature ion conductivity is estimated to be over 50 S/cm, enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with current highest reported value. Such unprecedented superionicity may also exist in other similar layered ion conductors, which may render technical advances and exotic effects such as ultrafast ion batteries and quantized ferroelectricity.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric composites integrate the coupling between magnetic and piezoelectric materials to create new functionalities for potential technological applications. This coupling is typically achieved through the exchange of magnetic, electric, or elastic energy across the interfaces between the different constituent materials. Tailoring the strength of the magnetoelectric effect is primarily accomplished by selecting suitable materials for each constituent and by optimizing geometrical and microstructural designs. Various composite architectures, such as (0-3), (2-2), (1-3) and core-shell connectivities, have been studied to enhance magnetoelectric coupling and other required physical properties in composites. This review examines the latest advancements in magnetoelectric materials, focusing on the impact of different interphase connectivity types on their properties and performance. Before exploring magnetic-electric coupling, a brief overview of the historical background of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is provided. Fundamental concepts underlying the magnetoelectric effect, piezoelectricity, and the magnetostrictive effect are explained, including their origins and examples of these materials' properties. So far, three types of magnetoelectric composite connectivities have been investigated experimentally: particulate composites (0-3), laminated and thin films (2-2), sticks embedded in matrix, core-shell particles, and coaxial fibers.

            <p>Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong this http URL of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Transition metal molybdenum oxides A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co) are known to be polar magnets where A ions are located in either octahedrally or tetrahedrally coordinated sites. In this paper we predict that their polarizations can be reversed via swapping of two coordinations for A ions, giving rise to robust vertical ferroelectricity. Such unique ferroelectricity via coordination swapping can be used to control the Neel vector in altermagnetic Fe2Mo3O8, while the large non-relativistic spin-splittings can be also altered by ferroelectric switching in Luttinger compensated magnetic Mn2Mo3O8, both in the absence of net magnetization. However, their ultra-thin layers may possess net magnetizations that can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching. Our findings provide a new type of multiferroicity as well as a new avenue in control of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</p>

In the present work, we provide general rules for obtaining nonzero Hopf term in spin systems when coupling to Dirac fermions. This method allows to direct dectation of the coefficient of the Hopf term without detailed calculations from path integral. We apply this framework to several models and verify that our results are self-consistent. Especially, we design a simple two-cone model on the checkerboard lattice and demonstrate how it realizes the Hopf term according to the above rules.</p>

            <p>Materials in the family $R$V$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ ($R=$ rare earth) provide a unique platform to investigate the interplay between local moments from $R$ layers and nonmagnetic vanadium kagome layers. Yet, the investigation of actinide members remains scarce. Here we report the synthesis of UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ single crystals through the self-flux technique. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion measurements reveal two uranium-driven antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=29$~K and $T_{N2}=24$~K, a complex field-temperature phase diagram, and unusual negative domain wall magnetoresistance. Specific heat measurements unveil a modest Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 40$~mJ/mol.K$^{2}$, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements that show a moderate $f$-electron enhancement at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$). Our experiments support a modest contribution from \textit{5f} flat bands to the density of states at $E_{F}$, whereas our band structure calculations place the vanadium flat bands 0.25~eV above $E_{F}$. Our findings point to a materials opportunity to expand the uranium 166 family with the goal of enhancing correlations by tuning $5f$ and $3d$ flat bands to $E_{F}$.</p>

            <h2>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Jiang, Shao-Kai Jian</p>
            <p>We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angelo Greco, Xavier Ballu, Francesco Giazotto, Alessandro Crippa</p>
            <p>Frequency combs represent exceptionally precise measurement tools due to the coherence of their spectral lines. While optical frequency comb sources constitute a well-established technology, superconducting circuits provide a relatively unexplored on-chip platform for low-dissipation comb emitters able to span from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate coherent microwave frequency comb generation by leveraging the ac Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum interference device. A time-dependent magnetic drive periodically generates voltage pulses, which in the frequency domain correspond to a comb with dozens of spectral modes. The micrometer-scale footprint and minimal dissipation inherent to superconducting systems foster the integration of our comb generator with advanced cryogenic electronics. Transferring optical techniques to the solid-state domain may enable new applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams could be a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their properties such as ultralightweight, huge volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that the charge-storage of carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by the wettability, surface area, and porosity of carbon nanostructures. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced around fifty times and the widened voltage of the device increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, although observed in previous literatures but unexplained, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser-deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</p>

            <p>Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p>Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.</p>

            <p>As a fundamental physical phenomenon, achieving and controlling a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is crucial for advancing the understanding of topological physics and for developing applied technologies in spintronics. The recently discovered topological Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =$ K, Rb, Cs)exhibits a significant AHE along with charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, providing an ideal platform to study the interactions between nontrivial band topology, CDW, and superconductivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the evolution of CDW, superconductivity, and AHE in electron (Mn)-doped Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. The experimental results show that electron doping rapidly suppresses superconductivity, while the CDW order remains relatively robust. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced AHE, with a maximum anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ~25331 \Ohm ^{-1}\cm^{-1} and an anomalous Hall angle of 6.66% occurs at a relatively low doping level of $x = 0.03$. Based on the Tian-Ye-Jin (TYJ) scaling model, such a significant enhancement AHC is mainly dominated by the skew scattering. We speculated enhanced skew scattering between electrons and Mn originating from the strengthened spin-orbital coupling. Our finding provides important guidance for the design and development of transverse transport properties in topological Kagome materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</p>

            <p>Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.</p>

In particular, understanding exciton-phonon interaction from first principles is a field of growing interest. Here, we present a many-body theory for coupled free-carrier, exciton, phonon and photon dynamics based on carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interaction matrix elements obtained via projection on Wannier orbitals. The framework is applied to study the impact of carrier-phonon correlations on optical spectra and coupled nonequilibrium carrier-phonon kinetics in monolayer MoSe$_2$. We find that non-Markovian effects and dynamical buildup of quasi-particles are only properly described if correlations at least on the two-phonon level are included. Our studies open a perspective to advance the material-realistic description of nonequilibrium physics in 2d nanostructures to new many-body realms.</p>

Based on the electrical response, the quality of the printed contacts is comparable to what is achievable with resist-based lithography techniques. These devices are tested by sweeping gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field to show that the materials remain pristine post-processing.

Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</p>

            <p>Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</p>

Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.</p>

            <p>Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</p>

            <p>In spaces of three or more dimensions, there exists topological physics of significant richness that has no lower-dimensional counterparts. To experimentally explore high-dimensional physics, it is advantageous to augment the physical space with synthetic dimensions. An emerging approach is to use a single modulated photonic ring resonator to form multiple synthetic frequency dimensions. However, all the high-dimensional Hamiltonians experimentally demonstrated in this approach are topologically trivial. Here we propose a general scheme to create high-dimensional topological physics using multiple synthetic frequency dimensions in a single ring resonator. This scheme utilizes specifically designed mode-selective modulations and mode conversions to create non-trivial topology. As examples, we numerically demonstrate a three-dimensional, two-band model exhibiting Weyl points and topological insulator phases, and a five-dimensional, four-band model exhibiting Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces. Our results will facilitate the experimental studies and future applications of topological physics in high dimensions.</p>

However, whether topological effects can arise solely from the structure of nonlinear interaction terms, and the nature of the resulting topological phases, remain to large extent open questions. Here we consider a chain of parametrically-driven quantum resonators coupled only via weak nearest-neighbour cross-Kerr interaction, without any quadratic tunneling term. We show that, when the drive overcomes a critical threshold value, the system undergoes a transition from the atomic limit of decoupled oscillators to a symmetry-broken topological phase. The topology is dictated by the structure of the Kerr nonlinearity, yielding a non-trivial bulk-boundary correspondence. In the topological phase, we find different effective models for periodic and open boundary conditions and derive analytical approximations for the low-energy spectrum, identifying the conditions to observe topological edge modes.</p>

            <h2>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iren Simko, Norah M. Hoffmann</p>
            <p>Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</p>

We develop a minimal model that captures the interplay between neutron superfluidity, proton superconductivity, and electromagnetic fields using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson, Ginzburg-Landau, and Maxwell equations. Our numerical simulations show that strong rotation enhances the net magnetic field inside the magnetar, suppresses superconductivity there, and amplifies the field near the surface. We explain this by a theory that makes testable predictions, including gravitational-wave signatures.</p>

            <h2>Automatic Characterization of Fluxonium Superconducting Qubits Parameters with Deep Transfer Learning</h2>

            <p>Accurate determination of qubit parameters is critical for the successful implementation of quantum information and computation applications. In solid state systems, the parameters of individual qubits vary across the entire system, requiring time consuming measurements and manual fitting processes for characterization. Recent developed superconducting qubits, such as fluxonium or 0-pi qubits, offer improved fidelity operations but exhibit a more complex physical and spectral structure, complicating parameter extraction. In this work, we propose a machine learning (ML)based methodology for the automatic and accurate characterization of fluxonium qubit parameters. Our approach utilized the energy spectrum calculated by a model Hamiltonian with various magnetic fields, as training data for the ML model. The output consists of the essential fluxonium qubit energy parameters, EJ, EC, and EL in Hamiltonian. The ML model achieves remarkable accuracy (with an average accuracy 95.6%) as an initial guess, enabling the development of an automatic fitting procedure for direct application to realistic experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate that similar accuracy can be retrieved even when the input experimental spectrum is noisy or incomplete, highlighting the model robustness. These results suggest that our automated characterization method, based on a transfer learning approach, provides a reliable framework for future extensions to other superconducting qubits or different solid-state systems. Ultimately, we believe this methodology paves the way for the construction of large-scale quantum processors.</p>

We measured a single-photon purity of $g^2(0)=0.006(3)$ under aboveband excitation. Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of $94.6\,\%$ with a temporal postselection of 100 ps time window and $5.58\,\%$ without temporal postselection. We measure a first-lens source efficiency of $\sim28\,\%$. These results highlight the potential of nanowire quantum dots as a promising source of telecom single photons for photonic quantum applications, offering deterministic positioning, efficient photon extraction, and scalable production.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Cupo, Shuanglong Liu, Silas Hoffman, X.-G. Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</p>

            <p>Developing optimal strategies to calibrate quantum processors for high-fidelity operation is one of the outstanding challenges in quantum computing today. Here, we demonstrate multiple examples of high-fidelity operations achieved using a unified global optimization-driven automated calibration routine on a six dot semiconductor quantum processor. Within the same algorithmic framework we optimize readout, shuttling and single-qubit quantum gates by tailoring task-specific cost functions and tuning parameters based on the underlying physics of each operation. Our approach reaches systematically $99\%$ readout fidelity, $>99\%$ shuttling fidelity over an effective distance of 10$\mu$m, and $>99.5\%$ single-qubit gate fidelity on timescales similar or shorter compared to those of expert human operators. The flexibility of our gradient-free closed loop algorithmic procedure allows for seamless application across diverse qubit functionalities while providing a systematic framework to tune-up semiconductor quantum devices and enabling interpretability of the identified optimal operation points.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging Vision Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for Automated Data Extraction from Plots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan</p>
            <p>Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.</p>

            <p>Superbunching effect with second-order correlations larger than 2, $g^{(2)}(0)>2$, indicating the N-photon bundles emission and strong correlation among photons, has a broad range of fascinating applications in quantum illumination, communication, and computation. However, the on-demand manipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under pulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and lab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the evolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo simulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon statistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from sub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) <1$) to superbunching emission, with the maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation, respectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the coincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the stray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of single colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI with reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise up to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the counts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly desired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.</p>

            <p>The BeEST experiment is measuring the ${}^{7}$Li recoil spectrum from the decay of ${}^{7}$Be implanted into Ta-based sensors to provide the most stringent limits on the existence of sterile neutrinos in the sub-MeV mass range. Its sensitivity is limited by spectral broadening due to interactions between the atomic shell of the ${}^{7}$Be/${}^{7}$Li and the Ta sensor film. This study is investigating the suitability of Nb as an alternative sensor material by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) of ${}^{7}$Li-implanted Nb films. STEM does not detect any change in the microstructure of polycrystalline Nb due to ${}^{7}$Li implantation. APT reveals some segregation of ${}^{7}$Li at grain boundaries in Nb. While this may slightly alter the ${}^{7}$Li binding energies, the effect on the recoil spectrum is not expected to be strong enough to preclude using Nb-based detectors in future phases of the BeEST experiment.</p>

Our larger framework consists of dedicated application, algorithm, and hardware layers, and easily generalizes to the maximum weight independent set problem. In this hybrid quantum-classical framework, which we call qReduMIS, the quantum computer is used as a co-processor to inform classical reduction logic about frozen vertices that are likely (or unlikely) to be in large independent sets, thereby opening up the reduction space after removal of targeted subgraphs. We systematically assess the performance of qReduMIS based on experiments with up to 231 qubits run on Rydberg quantum hardware available through Amazon Braket. Our experiments show that qReduMIS can help address fundamental performance limitations faced by a broad set of (quantum) solvers including Rydberg quantum devices. We outline implementations of qReduMIS with alternative platforms, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, and we discuss potential future extensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Teng, Orazio Scarlatella, Shiyu Zhou, Armin Rahmani, Claudio Chamon, Claudio Castelnovo</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence is a crucial resource in achieving quantum advantage over classical information processing, and more generally developing new quantum technologies. While its effects are observable in current quantum platforms, there are no standardized tools for systematically measuring and quantifying multi-qubit coherence across different gate-based quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to define a many-body quantum coherence length scale using anyon interference effects in a spin-chain setup, which effectively mirrors the problem of a quantum particle on a ring, with or without flux through it. We propose using the maximum length of the ring for which the presence or absence of flux can be clearly discerned, as a simple measure of the many-body quantum coherence grade (Q-grade) in a given quantum hardware. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented on gate-based quantum platforms to estimate and compare the quantum coherence of current devices, such as those from Google, IBM, IonQ, IQM, and Quantinuum that we considered here. This work aims to contribute to the creation of a live Web interface where the latest developments and advancements can be demonstrated, and progress in quantum coherence resources tracked over time. Establishing such a standardized quantum test would enable monitoring the growth of quantum coherence in gate-based quantum platforms, in a spirit similar to Moore's law.</p>

            <p>Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</p>

            <p>We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--Lück assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo A. Lessa, Shengqi Sang, Tsung-Cheng Lu, Timothy H. Hsieh, Chong Wang</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such symmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in mixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod out'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in long-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries of a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics) are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general procedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby symmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the input state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove that states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit long-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their topological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of topological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between higher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a robust quantum control framework that enables high-fidelity gate operations in semiconductor spin qubit systems with always-on couplings. Always-on interactions between qubits pose a fundamental challenge for quantum processors by inducing correlated errors that can trigger chaotic dynamics. Our approach suppresses both static coupling noise and time-dependent crosstalk without requiring high on/off ratio tunable couplers. Significantly, these pulses also prevent the emergence of chaotic entanglement growth in deep quantum circuits, preserving coherence in large multi-qubit systems. By relaxing hardware constraints on coupling control, our method provides a practical path toward scaling semiconductor quantum processors within existing fabrication capabilities, with particular relevance for silicon spin qubit architectures where high-contrast coupling modulation remains challenging.</p>

            <p>$\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500°C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jen-Tsung Hsiang, Bei-Lok Hu</p>
            <p>We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schrödinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.</p>

            <p>While the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics ignites a worldwide discussion on the origins of neural networks and their foundational links to physics, modern machine learning research predominantly focuses on computational and algorithmic advancements, overlooking a picture of physics. Here we introduce the concept of entropy into neural networks by reconceptualizing them as hypothetical physical systems where each parameter is a non-interacting 'particle' within a one-dimensional space. By employing a Wang-Landau algorithms, we construct the neural networks' (with up to 1 million parameters) entropy landscapes as functions of training loss and test accuracy (or loss) across four distinct machine learning tasks, including arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of \textit{entropy advantage}, where the high-entropy states generally outperform the states reached via classical training optimizer like stochastic gradient descent. We also find this advantage is more pronounced in narrower networks, indicating a need of different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of neural networks.</p>

            <p>Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.</p>

For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.</p>

            <h2>Realization of fermionic Laughlin state on a quantum processor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lingnan Shen, Mao Lin, Cedric Yen-Yu Lin, Di Xiao, Ting Cao</p>
            <p>Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Study of Magnetic Field Resilient High Impedance High-Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camille Roy, Simone Frasca, Pasquale Scarlino</p>
            <p>Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.</p>

            <h2>Realizing a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase in a Superconducting Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Ari Mizel</p>
            <p>We propose a superconducting quantum circuit whose low-energy degrees of freedom are described by the sine-Gordon (SG) quantum field theory. For suitably chosen parameters, the circuit hosts a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase protected by a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The ground state of the system is twofold degenerate and exhibits local spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry close to the edges of the circuit, leading to spontaneous localized edge supercurrents. The ground states host Majorana zero modes (MZM) at the edges of the circuit. On top of each of the two ground states, the system exhibits localized bound states at both edges, which are topologically protected against small disorder in the bulk. The spectrum of these boundary excitations should be observable in a circuit-QED experiment with feasible parameter choices.</p>

            <p>Active turbulence is a paradigmatic and fascinating example of self-organized motion at large scales occurring in active matter. We employ massive hydrodynamic simulations of suspensions of resolved model microswimmers to tackle the phenomenon in semi-dilute conditions at a mesoscopic level. We measure the kinetic energy spectrum and we detect a $k^{-3}$ power law regime. The velocity distributions are of Lévy type, a distinct difference with inertial turbulence. Furthermore, we propose a reduced order dynamical deterministic model for active turbulence, inspired to shell models for classical turbulence, whose numerical and analytical study confirms the spectrum powerlaw observed in the simulations and reveals hints of a non-Gaussian, intermittent, physics of active turbulence. Direct numerical simulations and modelling also agree in pointing to a phenomenological picture whereby, in the absence of an energy cascade à la Richardson forbidden by the low Reynolds number regime, it is the coupling between fluid velocity gradients and bacterial orientation that gives rise to a multiscale dynamics.</p>

Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</p>

            <p>The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase this http URL further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately this http URL constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom Drechsler, Matthias Vojta</p>
            <p>The destruction of the Kondo effect in a local-moment metal can lead to a topological non-Fermi-liquid phase, dubbed fractionalized Fermi liquid, with spinon-type excitations and an emergent gauge field. We demonstrate that, if the latter displays an internal $\pi$-flux structure, a chiral heavy-fermion metal emerges near the Kondo-breakdown transition. Utilizing a parton mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital antiferromagnet, and we derive a Landau-type theory which shows that such a phase generically emerges from a $\pi$-flux spin liquid. We discuss the relevance to pertinent experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer</p>
            <p>Non-collinear antiferromagnets (nAFMs) with a small net magnetic moment offer new opportunities for ultrafast spintronic devices, owing to unique physical properties. While in ferromagnets and collinear AFMs the spin current polarization is locked to the magnetization $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ and Néel vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ directions, we predict that magnon spin currents injected by metal contacts into nAFMs can be polarized with both $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ components when carried by a coherent superposition of magnon eigenstates. The spin injection efficiency is governed by an interface spin conductance tensor that depends on the non-collinear magnetic texture. While the $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$-component diffuses freely into the nAFM, the $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$-component oscillates as a function of distance from the injector and applied magnetic field, analogous to the Hanle effect of electron spins in metals. Our findings reveal the potential of nAFMs as platforms for the study of tensorial coherent spin transport.</p>

            <p>Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) is recognized as a host material to unconventional spin-triplet superconductivity, but it also exhibits a wealth of additional unusual behavior at high magnetic fields. One of the most prominent signatures of the unconventional superconductivity is a large and anisotropic upper critical field that exceeds the paramagnetic limit. This superconductivity survives to 35 T and is bounded by a discontinuous magnetic transition, which itself is also field-direction-dependent. A different, reentrant superconducting phase emerges only on the high-field side of the magnetic transition, in a range of angles between the crystallographic $b$ and $c$ axes. This review discusses the current state of knowledge of these high-field phases, the high-field behavior of the heavy fermion normal state, and other phases that are stabilized by applied pressure.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi</p>
            <p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust boundary Luttinger surfaces in topological band structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.</p>

            <p>The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium.

The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary L. Stevens-Hough, Matthew J. Davis, Lewis A. Williamson</p>
            <p>In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</p>

            <h2>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su, Ivar Martin</p>
            <p>Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Zündel, Leonardo Mazza, Léonie Canet, Anna Minguzzi</p>
            <p>We investigate the correlation properties in the steady state of driven-dissipative interacting bosonic systems in the quantum regime, as for example non-linear photonic cavities. Specifically, we consider the Bose-Hubbard model on a periodic chain and with spatially homogeneous one-body loss and pump within the Markovian approximation. The steady state is non-thermal and is formally equivalent to an infinite-temperature state with finite chemical potential set by the dissipative parameters. While there is no effect of interactions on the steady state, we observe a nontrivial behaviour of the space-time two-point correlation function, obtained by exact diagonalisation. In particular, we find that the decay width of the propagator is not only renormalised at increasing interactions, as it is the case of a single non-linear resonator, but also at increasing hopping strength. Furthermore, we numerically predict at large interactions a plateau value of the decay rate which goes beyond perturbative results in the interaction strength. We then compute the full spectral function, finding that it contains both a dispersive free-particle like dispersion at low energy and a doublon branch at energy corresponding to the on-site interactions. We compare with the corresponding calculation for the ground state of a closed quantum system and show that the driven-dissipative nature -- determining both the steady state and the dynamical evolution -- changes the low-lying part of the spectrum, where noticeably, the dispersion is quadratic instead of linear at small wavevectors. Finally, we compare to a high temperature grand-canonical equilibrium state and show the difference with respect to the open system stemming from the additional degree of freedom of the dissipation that allows one to vary the width of the dispersion lines.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moiré bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moiré band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</p>

            <p>InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. These QWs rely on InGaAs cladding layers and InAlAs barrier layers to confine electrons within a thin InAs well. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As cladding layers, grown on In$_{0.81}$Al$_{0.19}$As barrier layers, to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.</p>

            <p>We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Han, Mohit Pundir, Olga Fink, David S. Kammer</p>
            <p>Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. However, discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed to learn the constitutive law from deformation data. Nonetheless, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on boundary force data for training which are unavailable in many in-situ scenarios. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to learn physics-consistent constitutive relations solely from material deformation without boundary force information. This is achieved by considering a dynamic formulation rather than static equilibrium data and applying an input convex neural network (ICNN). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of hyperelastic material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations. It is, due to its design based on dynamics, particularly suited for applications to strain-rate-dependent materials and situations where constitutive laws need to be inferred from in-situ measurements without access to global force data.</p>

            <p>High-$T_c$ cuprates are characterized by strong spin fluctuations, which give rise to antiferromagnetic and pseudogap phases and may be key to the high superconducting critical temperatures observed in these materials. Experimental studies have revealed significant changes in the Hall coefficient $R_H$ across these phases, a phenomenon closely related to both spin fluctuations and changes in the Fermi surface morphology. Using the perturbation correction to Gaussian approximation (PCGA), we investigate the two-dimensional(2D) square-lattice single-band Hubbard model and obtain the self-energy with a finite imaginary part due to scattering. We calculate the density dependence of the Hall number $n_H=1/(qR_H)$. For small hole (or electron) doping $p$ (or $x$), our numerical results show that $n_H$ transitions from $p$ to $1+p$ for hole-doped systems, and from $-x$ to $1-x$ for electron-doped systems -- both in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between phase boundaries and the observed peculiar changes in the Hall number.</p>

This model can account for the ground state, excitations, the numerous field-induced fractional magnetization plateau phases and incommensurate magnetic correlations at elevated temperatures.

            <p>Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols. Finally, we develop a general machine learning framework to optimize the adaptive resetting protocol for an arbitrary task beyond the current state of the art. We use it to discover efficient protocols for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</p>

            <h2>Revealing nanoscale structural phase separation in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-δ}$ single crystal via scanning near-field optical microscopy</h2>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$ under high pressure,with an onset critical temperature around 80 K, has sparked significant interest in the superconducting phases of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, Lan+1NinO3n+1. While La4Ni3O10 exhibits nearly 100% superconductivity with Tc~30 K under high pressure, magnetic susceptibility studies on La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, however, reveal a more complex picture, indicating either filamentary superconductivity or that approximately 50% of crystal phase becomes superconducting in polycrystalline samples. In this study, we employed scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy to visualize nanoscale structural phase separation in La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, identifying enhanced optical conductivity with stripes approximately 183 nm wide. These stripes run diagonally with respect to the Ni-O-Ni bond directions in the a-b plane, ruling out the possibility that they arise from impurity phases, like the '1313', '214' or '4310' structures. The dark regions and bright stripes exhibit optical conductivities ~ 22% and 29% of gold's, respectively. Additionally, we find that the bright stripes constitute about 38% of the total field of view, while the remainder consists of dark regions and the transitional region between dark regions and bright stripes. Our results suggest that optical conductivity stripes originate from nanoscale structural phase separation. In contrast, La4Ni3O10 exhibits uniform and higher optical conductivity with no observable evidence of phase separation. Thus, our study represents a pioneering effort to directly image nanoscale phase separation in Lan+1NinO3n+1 nickelates. This observation could provide crucial insights into the factors that limit the superconducting volume fraction of La3Ni2O7-${\delta}$, highlighting SNOM as a powerful probe for exploring nanoscale low-energy physics in correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Exploring transport mechanisms in atomic precision advanced manufacturing enabled pn junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan P. Mendez, Xujiao Gao, Jeffrey Ivie, James H. G. Owen, Wiley P. Kirk, John N. Randall, Shashank Misra</p>
            <p>We investigate the different transport mechanisms that can occur in pn junction devices made using atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) at temperatures ranging from cryogenic to room temperature. We first elucidate the potential cause of the anomalous behavior observed in the forward-bias response of these devices in recent cryogenic temperature measurements, which deviates from the theoretical response of a silicon Esaki diode. These anomalous behaviors include current suppression at low voltages in the forward-bias response and a much lower valley voltage at cryogenic temperatures than theoretically expected for a silicon diode. To investigate the potential causes of these anomalies, we studied the effects of a few possible transport mechanisms, including band-to-band tunneling, band gap narrowing, potential impact of non-Ohmic contacts, band quantization, impact of leakage, and inelastic trap-assisted tunneling, through semi-classical simulations. We find that a combination of two sets of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) parameters can qualitatively approximate the shape of the tunneling current at low bias. This can arise from band quantization and realignment due to the strong potential confinement in $\delta$-layers. We also find that the lower-than-theoretically-expected valley voltage can be attributed to modifications in the electronic band structure within the $\delta$-layer regions, leading to a significant band-gap narrowing induced by the high density of dopants. Finally, we extend our analyses to room temperature operation and predict that trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) facilitated by phonon interactions may become significant, leading to a complex superposition of BTBT and TAT transport mechanisms in the electrical measurements.</p>

            <h2>Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$: Evidence against Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengjie Fang, Kumpei Imamura, Yuta Mizukami, Ryuichi Namba, Kota Ishihara, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Takasada Shibauchi</p>
            <p>Kitaev quantum spin liquids (KSLs) in layered honeycomb magnets are known to host Majorana quasiparticles, whose excitations depend strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In the high-field phase of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, specific heat measurements have revealed characteristic field-angle dependence of low-energy excitations consistent with the Kitaev model, providing bulk evidence for the KSL state. Here we present low-temperature measurements of specific heat $C(T)$ for another KSL candidate $\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{Co}_2\textrm{Te}\textrm{O}_6$ (NCTO) under field rotation within the honeycomb plane. Above the critical field of antiferromagnetic order, the field-angle dependence of $C/T$ exhibits minima along the bond directions, contrasting with the maxima observed in the KSL state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our analysis indicates nodeless, fully-gapped excitations, which are inconsistent with the angle-dependent Majorana excitations with gapless nodes predicted by the Kitaev model. These findings suggest that low-energy excitations in NCTO are governed by gapped magnon excitations rather than Majorana quasiparticles, providing thermodynamic evidence against a KSL state.</p>

            <h2>Effects of gravity on supersolid order in bubble-trapped bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Ciardi, Fabio Cinti, Giuseppe Pellicane, Santi Prestipino</p>
            <p>Unveiling the principles behind self-organization in quantum systems is of paramount importance, both intrinsically and practically, in view of foreseeable technological applications. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to atomic systems in curved geometries, which are a promising platform for the discovery of new emergent phenomena. A notable example is that of a gas of ultracold atoms loaded into a thin spherical shell, according to a protocol introduced by Zobay and Garraway more than twenty years ago. However, gravity prevents a dilute assembly of atoms from uniformly spreading throughout the shell, which explains why experiments on the condensation and superfluidity of bubble-trapped gases are usually conducted in space under microgravity conditions. In this paper, we focus instead on strongly-interacting quantum particles in a bubble trap, choosing the cluster supersolid of soft-core bosons as testbed. To study the impact of gravity on supersolid order, we consider a gedanken experiment in which the strength of gravity relative to the core repulsion is gradually enhanced. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we trace the parallel evolution of system structure and superfluidity at low temperature, finding that the latter is sizeable only when gravity is a small perturbation or, at the other extreme, so strong that particles are all gathered in one cluster at the bottom of the trap. Finally, we assess the relevance of gravity for the equilibrium behavior of ultracold Rydberg-dressed atoms in a bubble trap, concluding that in some cases clues of the supersolid phase in the absence of gravity could be found even in a laboratory on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Structure factor and topological bound of twisted bilayer semiconductors at fractional fillings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Zaklama, Di Luo, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>The structure factor is a useful observable for probing charge density correlations in real materials, and its long-wavelength behavior encapsulated by ``quantum weight'' has recently gained prominence in the study of quantum geometry and topological phases of matter. Here we employ the static structure factor, S(q), to explore the phase diagram of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically tMoTe2, at filling factors n=1/3, 2/3 under varying displacement fields. Our results reveal a topological phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a generalized Wigner crystal (GWC). This transition is marked by the appearance of Bragg peaks at charge-density-wave vectors, and simultaneously, large decrease of S(q) at small q which lowers the interaction energy. We further calculate the quantum weight of various FCI states, verifying the universal topological bound. Our findings provide new insights into the phase diagram of twisted TMDs and establish a general framework for characterizing topological phases through structure factor analysis.</p>

            <h2>Long-Range Correlations under Temperature Gradients: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Simple Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyoshi Nakano, Kazuma Yokota</p>
            <p>In fluids under temperature gradients, long-range correlations (LRCs) emerge generically, leading to enhanced density fluctuations. This phenomenon, characterized by the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the static structure factor (where $\boldsymbol{q}$ is the wavenumber), has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, they remain unexplored in Hamiltonian particle systems using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This Letter reports the first MD study to provide unambiguous observations of the LRCs. We demonstrate this by three distinct approaches: (1) measuring the static structure factor and directly observing the $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence characterizing the LRCs; (2) detecting the corresponding $\boldsymbol{q}^{-4}$ divergence in the dynamic structure factor; (3) establishing a quantitative agreement between MD results and predictions from fluctuating hydrodynamics, the phenomenological theory that predicts the LRCs. Our findings demonstrate that MD simulations offer a powerful complementary tool to theoretical and experimental investigations of LRCs.</p>

The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</p>

            <h2>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen T. Fuller, J.-X. Kent Zheng</p>
            <p>The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rand A. Al-Waqfi, Cengiz Khan, Oliver J. Irving, Lauren Matthews, Tim Albrecht</p>
            <p>Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sepide Mohamadi, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</p>

            <p>The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct structural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy rare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition under high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as temperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is closely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we systematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with temperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the energy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the experimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the electronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using DFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of Ce-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of Ce-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and CeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure of the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally observed structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in experiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the mixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our results suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the structural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize and CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may cause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase transition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of CeCoSi under high pressure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka</p>
            <p>Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.</p>

            <p>This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>A direct summation method for the Madelung constant calculation is presented where a crystal lattice is constructed from linear arrays of charges or axial multipoles. An array is designed to have vanishing low order electric moments such that its potential at the origin from a distance $r$ decays at least as fast as $r^{-5}$, but preferably as fast as $r^{-13}$. High potential decay rates render the summation absolutely convergent in up to 6 dimensions. Convergence speed increases with higher decay rates. It is also shown that the limit approached by the summation is independent of the growth geometry. Madelung constants for NaCl bulk, surface, and edge lattice points are calculated, as well as on off-lattice points such as interstitial positions and external neighborhoods of surfaces. In addition, bulk CsCl Madelung constant was calculated. In 1D, 2D, and 3D, accuracy of 13 decimal places are attained within 40 nearest neighbor distance from the reference ion.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <h2>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto Menta, Pablo G. Debenedetti, Roberto Car, Pablo M. Piaggi</p>
            <p>Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Previous simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition from a supercritical racemic liquid into a subcritical liquid enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral symmetry breaking. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking induced by electronic instability in the normal state of La_{1-x} Sr_{x} NiO_{2}</h2>

            <p>The spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking (RSB), a hallmark phenomenon in cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors, is believed to intimately connected to superconductivity, both of which originate from interactions among different degrees of freedoms and competing quantum states. Understanding RSB is pivotal for unraveling the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity. Although infinite-layer nickelates (ILNs) share similar crystalline structure and the same nominal 3d-electron configurations with cuprates, they have significant differences in Fermi surface topology, electronic band characteristics, and charge order. These distinctions make ILNs an ideal platform for studying RSB in unconventional superconductors. Through angular-resolved resistivity measurements within a large temperature and doping range, we identify pronounced RSB signatures near doping concentrations x=0.05 and 0.25. Based on the strongly correlated electronic structures from combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we find that the calculated electronic susceptibility has a peak structure at the corresponding doping concentration, indicating pronounced electronic instabilities which drive RSB. Detailed analysis of the electronic susceptibility demonstrates that the van Hove singularity at the Fermi level significantly contributes to the electronic instability at 0.05 Sr doping. Our findings reveal the important role of electronic correlation, Van Hove singularity, and Fermi surface nesting in the emergence of RSB. Our work not only deepens the understanding of electronic behavior in ILNs, but also provides new ideas and methods for exploring RSB in other unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saisai He, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Shijie Hu</p>
            <p>In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somak Basistha, Soumyajit Mandal, John Jesudasan, Vivas Bagwe, Pratap Raychaudhuri</p>
            <p>We use a two-coil mutual inductance technique to investigate the non-linear response of the vortex lattice of two type-II superconducting thin films, namely a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe) and a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN). We observe a strong dependence of the magnetic shielding response of the superconductors on the ac excitation amplitude in the primary coil of the two-coil setup. The sample response is studied through the evolution of the radial profile of the induced current density with increasing drive amplitude, which gets significantly modified by the effect of flux creep. We develop a computation scheme where we iteratively combine the coupled Maxwell-London equations for the geometry of the two coils and the sample involved, with a model developed by Coffey and Clem, to analyze the non-linear ac response. The central result of this analysis is that the effect of flux creep gives rise to a strong nonlinearity in the electrodynamic response in the vortex state of the superconducting thin films, that extends down to very low amplitudes of ac excitation. Our results also show that at subcritical low frequency ac drives, the vortex viscosity is exponentially larger than the Bardeen-Stephen estimate. We present a simple scheme to obtain the intrinsic value of the pinning force constant, which otherwise gets affected due to flux creep even at very low ac drives and point out some outstanding issues that need to be addressed in future theoretical and experimental studies.</p>

            <p>Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of ab initio methods to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Here, we resolve this challenge by developing an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Based on this theory, we demonstrate EPC-induced giant phonon magnetic moments and resulting phonon Zeeman splittings in magnetic metals, which are orders of magnitude larger than classical predictions from point-charge models. Interestingly, these splittings could open observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we first propose candidate materials with such intrinsic phonon Chern states hosting robust edge phonon currents which may be applied to detecting neutral particles such as dark matter particles. Our work not only establishes a theoretical foundation for EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, but also enables the ab initio calculation of long-sought TRS-breaking phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone in realistic materials.</p>

            <h2>Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuan Liu, Wen Wei Ho</p>
            <p>We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Kumar, Rafail Frantzeskakis, Edwin Barnes</p>
            <p>We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.</p>

            <p>Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</p>

            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</p>

            <h2>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via nonlocal visual interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Susumu Ito, Nariya Uchida</p>
            <p>Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</p>

            <p>Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</p>

Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, carbon nanofoam and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under different background gases (Ar, N2, N2-H2), and employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon electrode shows a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved compared to not-functionalized counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).</p>

We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</p>

We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</p>

            <p>Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Nishiyama, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets. The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</p>

            <p>Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Bao, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Zhihan Liu</p>
            <p>By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</p>

            <p>We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p>

            <p>Deep learning methods for material property prediction have been widely explored to advance materials discovery. However, the prevailing pre-train then fine-tune paradigm often fails to address the inherent diversity and disparity of material tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoMa, a Modular framework for Materials that first trains specialized modules across a wide range of tasks and then adaptively composes synergistic modules tailored to each downstream scenario. Evaluation across 17 datasets demonstrates the superiority of MoMa, with a substantial 14% average improvement over the strongest baseline. Few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlight MoMa's potential for real-world applications. Pioneering a new paradigm of modular material learning, MoMa will be open-sourced to foster broader community collaboration.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

            <p>Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiden Daniel, Tanmay Bhore, Jiannis K. Pachos, Chang Liu, Andrew Hallam</p>
            <p>The quantum description of a black hole predicts that quantum information hidden behind the event horizon can be teleported outside almost instantaneously. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral spin-chain model, which naturally simulates a binary black hole system, can realise this teleportation process. Our system captures two essential components of this protocol: Hawking radiation, which generates the necessary entanglement between the black holes, and optimal scrambling, which enables high-fidelity teleportation on short timescales. Through numerical simulations, we quantify the key timescales governing the process, including the Page time, radiation time, scrambling time, and butterfly velocity, showing their universal dependence on the chiral coupling strength. Our results establish the feasibility of simulating quantum properties of black holes within condensed matter systems, offering an experimentally accessible platform for probing otherwise inaccessible high-energy phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasmin Bedow, Dirk K. Morr</p>
            <p>Executing quantum algorithms using Majorana zero modes - a major milestone for the field of topological quantum computing - requires a platform that can be scaled to large quantum registers, can be controlled in real time and space, and a braiding protocol that uses the unique properties of these exotic particles. Here, we demonstrate the first successful simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures from initialization to read-out of the final many-body state. Utilizing the Majorana zero modes' topological properties, we introduce an optimized braiding protocol for the algorithm and a scalable architecture for its implementation with an arbitrary number of qubits. We visualize the algorithm protocol in real time and space by computing the non-equilibrium density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance, and the non-equilibrium charge density, which assigns a unique signature to each final state of the algorithm.</p>

            <p>The entanglement of microwave photons and spin qubits in silicon represents a pivotal step forward for quantum information processing utilizing semiconductor quantum dots. Such hybrid spin circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been achieved by granting a substantial electric dipole moment to a spin by de-localizing it in a double quantum dot under spin-orbit interaction, thereby forming a flopping-mode (FM) spin qubit. Despite its promise, the coherence properties demonstrated to date remain insufficient to envision FM spin qubits as practical single qubits. Here, we present a FM hole spin qubit in a silicon nanowire coupled to a high-impedance niobium nitride microwave resonator for readout. We report Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and coherence times in the microsecond range, resulting in a high single gate quality factor of 380. This establishes FM spin qubits as fast and reliable qubits. Moreover, using the large frequency tunability of the FM qubit, we reveal for the first time that photonic effects predominantly limit coherence, with radiative decay being the main relaxation channel and photon shot-noise inducing dephasing. These results highlight that optimized microwave engineering can unlock the potential of FM spin qubits in hybrid cQED architectures, offering a scalable and robust platform for fast and coherent spin qubits with strong coupling to microwave photons.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a Néel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear Néel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42° and 26° respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered Néel order of local dipole moments.</p>

By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</p>

            <p>Magnetic Janus particles allow access to complex, nonlinear assembled structures that may enable interesting new magnetorheological (MR) fluids with uniquely engineered field responses. However, the overwhelming size of the parameter space for Janus and patchy particles makes exploration of such systems by experimental trial and error or through detailed simulation impractical. Here, a differential evolution (DE)-based simulation method is explored to predict the assembly of magnetic Janus particles as an alternative method for assembly prediction. Structure predictions from the DE simulation for laterally- and radially-shifted magnetic Janus particles are compared to four published experimental and simulation case studies. The DE simulation captures the orientation and structure of magnetic Janus particles for a range of shifts and a variety of external field conditions using the point dipole approximation. Structural predictions that rely on the reorganization of large clusters of particles were less well represented by the DE predictions. Despite this limitation, the DE simulation method can be used to predict key structural factors for magnetic Janus particle assemblies, as demonstrated by favorable comparison with three of the four model studies.</p>

            <p>Electronic correlations beyond static mean-field theories are of fundamental importance in describing the properties of complex materials - such as transition-metal oxides - where the low-energy physics is driven by localized d or f electrons. Here, we show that it is possible to capture these correlations with a local and dynamical self energy, extending to the spin-polarized and multi-site case our recently introduced dynamical Hubbard functional formulation. We apply this formalism to the prototypical transition-metal monoxide series of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in their ground state, finding excellent agreement with experiments for the spectral properties. The results are comparable or improved with respect to state-of-the-art theories, both for the densities of states and for the spectral functions - including band renormalization and spectral weight transfer - in a numerically efficient and physically transparent treatment of correlations amenable to the study of realistic, complex materials.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility via Fermi surface nesting, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</p>

            <p>We perform a high-throughput computational search for novel phonon-mediated superconductors, starting from the Materials Cloud 3-dimensional structure database of experimentally known inorganic stoichiometric compounds. We first compute the Allen-Dynes critical temperature (T$_c$) for 4533 non-magnetic metals using a direct and progressively finer sampling of the electron-phonon couplings. For the candidates with the largest T$_c$, we use automated Wannierizations and electron-phonon interpolations to obtain a high-quality dataset for the most promising 240 dynamically stable structures, for which we calculate spectral functions, superconducting bandgaps, and isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg critical temperatures. For 110 of these, we also provide anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting gaps and critical temperatures. The approach is remarkably successful in finding known superconductors, and we find 24 unknown ones with a predicted anisotropic Tc above 10 K. Among them, we identify a possible double gap superconductor (p-doped BaB$_2$), a non-magnetic half-Heusler ZrRuSb, and the perovskite TaRu$_3$C, all exhibiting significant T$_c$.

            <p>Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional splitting of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.</p>

            <p>The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect has recently been experimentally observed in zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCI). However, an outstanding challenge is the presence of a substantial longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ (a few k$\Omega$), even though the anomalous Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ is quantized. This dissipative behavior is likely linked to imperfect sample quality. Here, we report transport measurements of a drastically improved twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ bilayer device, which exhibits quantized $R_{xy}$ and vanishing $R_{xx}$ for the $-2/3$ state, marking a dissipationless FCI. Contrary to fractional quantum Hall states where the energy gap increases with magnetic field, we find that the thermal activation gap of the observed FCI states decreases rapidly as the magnetic field rises from zero, then plateaus above a few teslas. This observation is attributed to the interplay between spin and charge gaps. Due to the spontaneous ferromagnetism, the spin gap dominates at low field, while the charge gap becomes appreciable once the magnetic field freezes spin fluctuations. For the $-2/3$ state, we estimate the spin and FCI gap of about 55 and 20 K, respectively. Our results provide insights into the energy scale of FCI and offer a pathway for quantum engineering of exotic correlated topological states.</p>

            <h2>A pseudo-dynamic phase-field model for brittle fracture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Michael Sargado, Joachim Mathiesen</p>
            <p>The enforcement of global energy conservation in phase-field fracture simulations has been an open problem for the last 25 years. Specifically, the occurrence of unstable fracture is accompanied by a loss in total potential energy, which suggests a violation of the energy conservation law. This phenomenon can occur even with purely quasi-static, displacement-driven loading conditions, where finite crack growth arises from an infinitesimal increase in load. While such behavior is typically seen in crack nucleation, it may also occur in other situations. Initial efforts to enforce energy conservation involved backtracking schemes based on global minimization, however in recent years it has become clearer that unstable fracture, being an inherently dynamic phenomenon, cannot be adequately resolved within a purely quasi-static framework. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether transitioning to a fully dynamic framework would sufficiently address the issue. In this work, we propose a pseudo-dynamic framework designed to enforce energy balance without relying on global minimization. This approach incorporates dynamic effects heuristically into an otherwise quasi-static model, allowing us to bypass solving the full dynamic linear momentum equation. It offers the flexibility to simulate crack evolution along a spectrum, ranging from full energy conservation at one extreme to maximal energy loss at the other. Using data from recent experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can closely replicate experimental load-displacement curves, achieving results that are unattainable with classical phase-field models.</p>

Our results reveal that the linearly polarized AC electric-field irradiation induces a topological phase transition from a single-Q spiral state to a bimeron crystal with the skyrmion number of one in the low-frequency regime. Furthermore, we show that the obtained bimeron crystal remains relatively stable against both easy-axis and easy-plane single-ion anisotropies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatia Kiliptari, Dmitrii L. Maslov</p>
            <p>The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a classic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp scattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur. In this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such as dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected Fermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a two-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first non-zero contribution scales as $T^4\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this paper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from electron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the $T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal magnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\ln T$, respectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling, i.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered for a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum, magnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when electron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that all components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values that are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the corresponding values at $T=0$.</p>

            <h2>A controllable theory of superconductivity due to strong repulsion in a polarized band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Can strong repulsive interaction be shown to give rise to pairing in a controllable way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction overlap is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. We illustrate our method with a two-band model that is often used to describe multi-layer rhombohedral graphene and comment on the relationship with experiments. This work opens a reliable pathway to search for topological superconductors with high-$T_c$ (relative to $\epsilon_F$) in materials with strongly interactions. We summarize the requirements and suggest some illustrative design structures.</p>

            <p>Recent observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect in magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2Sb2 has drawn attention to out-of-plane orbital magnetization induced by an in-plane field component. Here we study EuZn2Sb2, a sister compound of EuCd2Sb2, to demonstrate sensitive changes of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect on the band modulation. The Hall resistivity measured with rotating the magnetic field within the (001) principal plane of EuZn2Sb2 films exhibits a clear three-fold component corresponding to the in-plane anomalous Hall effect, which is distinct from the two-fold component of the planar Hall effect. The in-plane anomalous Hall effect of EuZn2Sb2 is highly contrasting to EuCd2Sb2, especially in terms of its opposite sign and field dependence, which can be explained by model calculations with different band inversion parameters. Our results pave the way for systematically controlling the in-plane anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization through elaborate band engineering.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Feifei Zhang, Yu Pang, Huiyan Zhao, Guocai Liu, Chao He, Xingtao An</p>
            <p>The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline. This study investigates the humidity-induced failure mechanisms in crystalline silicon solar cells. Using density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we systematically examine the microscopic diffusion mechanisms of hydrogen and oxygen defects and their impact on photovoltaic performance. Hydrogen and oxygen are interstitial defects that can introduce both deep-level and resonant-state recombination centers, thereby reducing carrier lifetime and solar cell efficiency. Furthermore, hydrogen exhibits prominent diffusion pathways, particularly in its +1 and 0 charge states at the BC site ( "H" _"i(BC)" ^"+1" and "H" _"i(BC)" ^"0" ), while oxygen in its +1 and 0 charge states shows a higher diffusion barrier at the BC1 site ( "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"+1" and "O" _"i(BC1)" ^"0" ). These defects, induced by moisture and temperature fluctuations, exacerbate the degradation of solar cell performance. By analyzing these defect behaviors, this research provides valuable insights into the failure mechanisms of Si solar cells, especially under humid conditions.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Electrode Wettability to Optimize Nanobubble Nucleation and Reaction Rates in Electrochemical Gas-Evolving Reactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenlei Wanga, Yaxi Yua, Mengkai Qin, Hao Jiang, Zhenjiang Guo, Lu Bai, Limin Wang, Xiaochun Zhang, Xiangping Zhang, Yawei Liu</p>
            <p>Bubble formation in electrochemical system often hinders reaction efficiency by reducing active surface area and obstructing mass transfer, yet the mechanisms governing their nanoscale nucleation dynamics and impact remains unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore nanobubble nucleation and reaction rates during water electrolysis on planar- and nano-electrodes, with systematically tuning electrode wettability through water-electrode and gas-electrode interactions. We identified distinct nucleation regimes: gas layers, surface nanobubbles, bulk nanobubbles, and no nanobubbles, and revealed a volcano-shaped relationship between wettability and reaction rate, where optimal wettability strikes a balance between suppressing bubbles and ensuring sufficient reactant availability to maximize performance. Nanoelectrodes consistently exhibit higher current densities compared to planar electrodes with the same wettability, due to pronounced edge effects. Furthermore, moderate driving forces enhance reaction rates without triggering surface bubble formation, while excessive driving forces induce surface nanobubble nucleation, leading to suppressed reaction rates and complex dynamics driven by bubble growth and detachment. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning wettability and reaction driving forces to optimize gas-evolving electrochemical systems at the nanoscale and underscore the need for multiscale simulation frameworks integrating atomic-scale reaction kinetics, nanoscale bubble nucleation, and microscale bubble dynamics to fully understand bubble behavior and its impact on performance.</p>

            <p>Multiferroic materials, characterized by the occurrence of two or more ferroic properties, hold potential in future technological applications and also exhibit intriguing phenomena caused by the interplay of multiple orders. One such example is the formation of spin cycloid structures within multiferroic materials, which we investigate in this work by focusing on their magnon excitations and transport based on a general multiferroic Hamiltonian with an antiferromagnetic order. More specifically, we identify the ground state and explore the dynamics of magnon modes, revealing distinct in-plane and out-of-plane modes with anisotropic dispersion this http URL magnon modes include a massless excitation, known as the Goldstone boson, originating from the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry by the formation of the cycloid structures. By employing the Boltzmann transport formalism, the magnonic thermal conductivity with spin cycloids and low-temperature anisotropic behaviors is discussed. This work provides pathways to envision the spin-textured multiferroics, which may serve as a fertile ground to look for novel thermal and spin transport with the rich interplay of quasiparticles such as magnons and phonons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, M. Kaltak, Bongjae Kim</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a systematic comparison of various approaches within the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) for calculating the Coulomb interaction parameter U. While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO2 (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</p>

            <p>Recently, some $Z_2$ monopole charges were defined for Dirac semimetals with $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal) in previous works, and the charges are believed to lead to double-helicoid surface states. However, no proof of the bulk-surface correspondence is given there. In this paper, we point out one of the $Z_2$ charges in the previous works is gauge-dependent, and newly define another $Z_2$ charge. Using this new $Z_2$ charge, we give a proof of the bulk-surface correspondence. We also compare the new $Z_2$ charge with the $Z_2$ invariant for $\mathcal{G}$-protected topological crystalline insulators, and the second Stiefel-Whitney number for $\mathcal{PT}$-protected nodal line semimetals.</p>

            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely applied to a variety of realistic materials but often struggles to explain the properties of correlated systems. The DFT + U method, which introduces a Hubbard U correction to the DFT, has been instrumental in providing the treatment of systems such as transition metal oxide. The methodological details of DFT + U and their specifics on the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the correlated systems remain incompletely understood. In this study, taking the prototypical transition metal oxide system, LaMnO3, as an example, we systematically assess the performance of the two distinct DFT + U methods, spin-polarized DFT (SDFT + U) and spin-un-polarized DFT (CDFT + U). We found that while Coulomb U acts similarly for the two approaches, Hund JH plays a fundamentally different role, particularly in the determination of the magnetic phases. Our investigation shows the active role of Hund JH on the exchange splitting, leading to distinct magnetic ground configurations in the two methods. We further investigate the associated magnetic exchange interactions and compare our results with so-called beyond-DFT methods.</p>

            <p>Efficient magnetic switching is a cornerstone for advancing spintronics, particularly for energy-efficient data storage and memory devices. Here, we report the electrical switching of spin-flips in V-doped WSe2 multilayers, a van der Waals (vdW)-layered diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), demonstrating ultralow-power switching operation at room temperature. Our study reveals unique linear magnetoresistance and parabolic magnetoresistance states, where electrical modulation induces transitions between interlayered ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic configurations. We identify an unconventional linear magnetoresistance hysteresis characterized by electrically driven spin flip/flop switching, distinct from conventional random network disorder or linear band-dispersion mechanisms. Applying an electrical voltage across vertical vdW layered V-doped WSe2 multilayers generates the spin currents at room temperature, driving spin-flip transitions from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic states due to a strong spin transfer torque effect. Notably, the critical current density reaches an ultralow value of 10-1Acm-2, accompanied by pico-watt power consumption, a record-low spin current density by a six-order-of-magnitude improvement over conventional spintronic devices. These findings establish the V-doped WSe2 multilayer device as a transformative platform for ultralow power spintronics, underscoring the potential of vdW-layered DMS systems for next generation energy-efficient spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the efficient excitation of spin waves in the ultra-low magnetic damping material yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). To this end, we employ interdigital transducers fabricated on a piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film covering the YIG. This enables the excitation of coherent, propagating Rayleigh-type and Sezawa-type SAWs. We find that the ultralow magnetic damping of YIG is retained after the ZnO-deposition and we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the magnetoelastic interaction due to the different SAW modes as a function of the external magnetic field magnitude and orientation. By measuring the SAW attenuation our experiments reveal a highly anisotropic and non-reciprocal SAW-SW-interaction in agreement with our model caluclation, while demonstrating that low-damping magnons can be efficiently excited by SAWs.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</p>

The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of $c$-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the \neelfm\ phase is a rare example of {\it intrinsic} altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. The existence of this phase may resulting in nontrivial effect on the re-emerging superconducting phase of \kfsxy\ under high pressure.</p>

            <p>Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) is a powerful method for probing the optical properties of surfaces, used routinely in research and industrial applications, yet the origin of 'bulk-related' features that appear in the spectra of various surfaces has been debated for nearly 40 years. It is often argued that these features are related to surface-induced bulk anisotropy (SIBA) because they coincide with critical energies of the bulk dielectric function. In general, any quantitative RAS theory must include excitonic effects as they significantly influence the spectra and are believed to be the key to determining the origin of SIBA features. Here, we introduce a layer-resolved exciton localization (LREL) measure within the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which enables a quantitative analysis of the origins of 'bulk-related' RAS features. Applying LREL to arsenic-modified silicon reconstructions reveals that, depending on the surface reconstruction, the 'apparent' SIBA features arise primarily from states localized at the surface, with only a small contribution from the underlying layers. Our findings, further supported by the fact that the calculated spectra agree well with low-temperature RAS measurements, challenge the conventional explanation of 'bulk-related' RAS features. They indicate that in many instances bulk-enhanced surface anisotropies (BESA)-the opposite of SIBA-contribute to, or are even responsible for, 'bulk-related' RAS features. Therefore, we suggest that previously studied semiconductor surfaces, which exhibit 'bulk-related' features in their spectra, should be reanalyzed using the presented method.</p>

            <p>Climate emergency has led to the investigation of CO$_{2}$ valorization routes. A competitive process included in this framework is the catalytic CO$_{2}$ cycloaddition to epoxides, to produce cyclic carbonates. Halide-based Ionic liquids (ILs) have been postulated to be a competitive choice. Nevertheless, the structure-performance relation for different ILs is still a topic of debate, being the cation-anion dissociation constant a key descriptor. In this work, the ions effect is tackled by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Propylene oxide and carbonate force fields were tested and used for 1,2-epoxyhexane and hexylene carbonate force field construction, while ILs were modelled by the CL\&P force field. Solubilities in an epoxide-carbonate medium were tested for ILs composed of [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] or [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cations combined with the halide anions: Iodide [$\mathrm{I^-}$], Bromide [$\mathrm{Br^-}$] and Chloride [$\mathrm{Cl^-}$]. Results showed that [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids were insoluble in the epoxide/carbonate medium, whereas [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids demonstrated diffusion. Reaction medium interactions were studied between key atoms for experimentally soluble ILs. It was found that cation-anion interaction follows the catalytic activity trend, being [$\mathrm{I^-}$] the halide anion less associated with ([$\mathrm{N4444^+}$], [$\mathrm{bmim^+}$] and [$\mathrm{emim^+}$]) cations. A correlation between the first peak integration of the radial distribution functions and the experimental yields (including [$\mathrm{N1111^+}$][$\mathrm{Br^-}$]) could be established with a regression coefficient of 0.86. Additionally, [$\mathrm{I^-}$] based ILs displayed a better interaction between the cation and the epoxide oxygen, phenomena linked to epoxide activation and intermediates stabilization.</p>

            <p>An out of equilibrium two-dimensional superfluid relaxes towards equilibrium via a process of coarsening, driven by the annihilation of vortices with antivortices. Here we present a comparison of two different numerical models of this process, a dissipative point vortex model and Fokker-Planck evolution, across a wide range of initial configurations and levels of dissipation. We find that our dissipative point vortex model is well-approximated by Fokker-Planck evolution only for very low initial energies per vortex, approximately less than -4, when almost all vortices and antivortices are closely bound into dipoles. We observe that the dynamical critical exponent, $z$, in the dissipative point vortex model, undergoes a crossover, from a roughly constant value close to two for energy per vortex approximately greater than -4 to one which depends explicitly on the initial conditions for energy per vortex approximately less than -5.</p>

            <p>Infinite layer nickelates have garnered significant attention due to their potential for high-temperature superconductivity. Despite extensive research, the interplay between oxygen stoichiometry and electronic properties in infinite layer nickelates remains inadequately understood. In this study, we employ advanced electron microscopy techniques and theoretical modeling to directly visualize the distribution of residual oxygen within an 8NdNiO$_2$/2SrTiO$_3$ superlattice, providing novel insights into its structural and electronic effects. Our multislice ptychography analysis reveals a disordered arrangement of apical oxygen atoms, even in regions with low residual oxygen occupancy, invisible in conventional projected images but discernible in depth-resolved phase contrast images. This disordered distribution suggests the formation of local domains with varying degrees of oxygenation, leading to significant structural distortions. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals inhomogeneous hole doping, which may influence the occurrence of superconductivity. Complementary density functional theory calculations show how residual oxygen and associated structural distortions, such as pyramidal and octahedral configurations, alter the electronic structure. Although superconductivity was not observed in the studied superlattice, our findings highlight the critical influence of residual oxygen in shaping electronic phases and suggest that precise control of oxygen stoichiometry is essential in infinite layer nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Travěnec, Ladislav Šamaj</p>
            <p>A limited number of 2D and 3D materials under a constant pressure contract in volume upon heating isobarically; this anomalous phenomenon is known as the negative thermal expansion (NTE). In this paper, the NTE anomaly is observed in 1D fluids of classical particles interacting pairwisely with two competing length scales: the hard-core diameter $a$ and the finite range $a'>a$ of a soft repulsive potential component. If $a'\le 2a$, the pair interactions reduce themselves to nearest neighbours which permits a closed-form solution of thermodynamics in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble characterized by temperature $T$ and pressure $p$. We focus on the equation of state (EoS) which relates the average distance between particles (reciprocal density) $l$ to $T$ and $p\ge 0$. The EoS is expressible explicitly in terms of elementary or special functions for specific, already known and new, cases like the square shoulder, the linear and quadratic ramps as well as certain types of logarithmic interaction potentials. The emphasis is put on low-$T$ anomalies of the EoS. Firstly, the equidistant ground state as the function of the pressure can exhibit, at some ``compressibility'' pressures, a jump in chain spacing from $a'$ to $a$. Secondly, the analytical structure of the low-$T$ expansion of $l(T,p)$ depends on ranges of $p$-values. Thirdly, the presence of the NTE anomaly depends very much on the shape of the core-softened potential.</p>

We show that quasiparticle excitations acquire a non-Fermi liquid scattering rate near the critical point but remain remarkably robust throughout the transition.

            <p>Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clara J. Lapp, Julia M. Link, Carsten Timm</p>
            <p>Nodal noncentrosymmetric superconductors can host zero-energy flat bands of Majorana surface states within the projection of the nodal lines onto the surface Brillouin zone. Thus, these systems can have stationary, localized Majorana wave packets on certain surfaces, which may be a promising platform for quantum computation. Such applications require protocols to manipulate the wave packets in order to move them without destroying their localization or coherence. As a step in this direction, we explore the idea that the surface states have a nontrivial spin polarization, which can couple for example to the magnetization of a ferromagnetic insulator in contact to the surface, via an exchange term in the Hamiltonian. Such a coupling can make the previously flat bands weakly dispersive. We aim to model the motion of spatially localized wave packets under the influence of an exchange field which is changed adiabatically. We calculate the time-evolved wave packet for a model system and discuss which factors influence the direction of motion and the broadening of the wave packet.</p>

            <p>Control of magnetism through voltage-driven ionic processes (i.e., magneto-ionics) holds potential for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility, flexibility in adjusting the magnitude and speed of magnetic modulation, and energy efficiency. Since magneto-ionics depends on factors like ionic radius and electronegativity, identifying alternative mobile ions is crucial to embrace new phenomena and applications. Here, the feasibility of C as a prospective magneto-ionic ion is investigated in a Fe-C system by electrolyte gating. In contrast to most magneto-ionic systems, Fe-C presents a dual-ion mechanism: Fe and C act as cation and anion, respectively, moving uniformly in opposite directions under an applied electric field. This leads to a 7-fold increase in saturation magnetization with magneto-ionic rates larger than 1 emu cm-3 s-1, and a 25-fold increase in coercivity. Since carbides exhibit minimal cytotoxicity, this introduces a biocompatible dimension to magneto-ionics, paving the way for the convergence of spintronics and biotechnology.</p>

            <h2>Toughness of double network hydrogels: the role of reduced stress propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel B. Walker, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.</p>

            <p>The heavy fermion metamagnet uranium ditelluride possesses two distinct magnetic field--induced superconducting states. One of these superconductive phases resides at magnetic fields immediately below a first-order metamagnetic transition to a field--polarized paramagnetic state at a field strength $H_m$, while the other exists predominantly above $H_m$. However, little is known about the microscopic properties of this polarized paramagnetic state. Here we report pulsed magnetic field measurements tracking the evolution of $H_m$ for polar and azimuthal inclinations in the vicinity of the crystallographic $b-a$ plane. We uncover a region of the phase diagram at high fields $>$ 50 T with a ripple-like non-monotonic dependence of $H_m$ on the orientation of field. Within this ripple in the metamagnetic transition surface, $H_m$ exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence. Our results point towards the presence of complex magnetic interactions and possible magnetic sub-phases at high magnetic fields in UTe$_2$, which may have important implications for the manifestation of exotic field-induced superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>A spinless crystal for a high-performance solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clock</h2>

            <p>Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks require a host material whose band gap is larger than the 8.4 eV nuclear transition energy. As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\sigma = 4.6\times10^{-23}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where ${\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized. This is roughly six orders of magnitude lower than previously thought possible.</p>

            <h2>The stress tensor of dilute active colloidal suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Gaspard</p>
            <p>The stress tensor is calculated for dilute active suspensions composed of colloidal Janus particles propelled by self-diffusiophoresis and powered by a chemical reaction. The Janus particles are assumed to be spherical and made of catalytic and non-catalytic hemispheres. The chemical reaction taking place on the catalytic part of each Janus particle generates local molecular concentration gradients at the surface of the particle and, thus, an interfacial velocity slippage between the fluid and the solid particle, which is the propulsion mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis. In the dilute-system limit, the contributions of the suspended particles to the stress tensor are calculated by solving the chemohydrodynamic equations for the fluid velocity and the molecular concentrations around every Janus particle considered as isolated and far apart from each other. The results are the following. First, the well-known Einstein formula for the effective shear viscosity of colloidal suspensions is recovered, including the effect of a possible Navier slip length. Next, two further contributions are obtained, which depend on the molecular concentrations of the fuel and product species of the chemical reaction and on the orientation of the Janus particles. The second contribution is caused by simple diffusiophoresis, which already exists in passive suspensions with global concentration gradients and no reaction. The third contribution is due to the self-diffusiophoresis generated by the chemical reaction, which arises in active suspensions. The calculation gives quantitative predictions, which depend on the constitutive properties of the fluid and the fluid-solid interfaces, as well as on the geometry of the Janus particles.</p>

            <h2>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma</p>
            <p>Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.</p>

            <p>Voltage control of magnetism via magneto-ionics, where ion transport and/or redox processes drive magnetic modulation, holds great promise for next-generation memories and computing. This stems from its non-volatility and ability to precisely tune both the magnitude and speed of magnetic properties in an energy-efficient manner. However, expanding magneto-ionics to incorporate novel mobile ions or even multiple ion species is crucial for unlocking new phenomena and enabling multifunctional capabilities. Here, we demonstrate voltage-driven multi-ion transport in a FeBO system with increasing oxygen content, progressively transitioning from an electrostatic-like response to a more pronounced electrochemical (magneto-ionic) behavior. The voltage-driven transport of both B and Fe is activated by oxidation state tuning, owing to the larger electronegativity of oxygen. Such charge-transfer effects allow multi-ion magneto-ionics, where O ions move oppositely to Fe and B ions. These results pave the way for programmable functionalities by leveraging elements with different electron affinities through charge-transfer engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niels T. Pronk, Bowy M. La Rivière, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>We report a phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor Heisenberg and three-site interactions in the presence of single-ion anisotropy. We show that the Gaussian and Ising transitions that separate the topological Haldane phase from the two anisotropic phases eventually fuse into a higher symmetry point characterized by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) SU(2)$_2$ critical theory providing a lattice realization of the conformal embedding. On the other side of the WZW multi-critical point, the Ising transition reappears together with the distinct and exotic $c=1$ transition belonging to the eight-vertex universality class. This transition, which separates the dimerized and Ising antiferromagnetic phases - two ordered phases with incompatible order parameters - is thus a one-dimensional realization of a deconfined quantum criticality.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying ultra-fast electron dynamics and material properties, where the coherent character of the electron dynamics is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we expound a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs inter-band contributions to the total signal. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space of this coherent suppression of high harmonics in systems of massive Dirac Fermions. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case. Moreover, we demonstrate reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics upon increasing dephasing.</p>

            <p>Lead-halide perovskites exhibit remarkable efficiency in photovoltaics, driven by exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths and recombination times. Paradoxically, this performance persists even in defect-rich, solution-grown samples. Here, we use a suite of optical and charge transport measurements to reveal that key optoelectronic properties of perovskites arise from localized flexoelectric polarization confined to the interfaces between domains of spontaneous strain, present even in nominally cubic single crystals. This insight provides a microscopic link between structural composition and charge transport in these materials, reconciling conflicting prior observations and offering new design principles for perovskite-based solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Influence of tip materials on the friction force microscopy of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001): comparison of diamond and silicon tips in experiments and atomistic simulations</h2>

            <p>Friction force microscopy (FFM) with silicon tips on epitaxial graphene supported by SiC(0001) previously revealed a sharp increase in friction at a threshold normal force, linked to the intermittent rehybridization of graphene and the formation of single-layer diamond above 12 GPa. In this study, the FFM behavior of a diamond tip is compared with that of the silicon tip. The diamond tip exhibited a similar abrupt increase in friction, but the threshold normal force was approximately twice as high for comparable tip radii. Simulations of graphene on SiC(0001) sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a-C) and silicon oxide (SiO2) slabs show that both systems exhibit low shear stress at low pressures, which increases at higher pressures due to bond formation between the graphene and counter slabs. The pressure dependence differs slightly: SiO2 reaches a shear stress plateau around 6 GPa, while a-C continues to increase gradually. For a-C, the transition threshold shifts to higher pressures, consistent with FFM results. Temperature lowers the transition threshold significantly, while sliding velocity has minimal impact on shear stress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low-friction interfaces between epitaxial graphene and the key materials which come into contact with graphene in current micro-electro-mechanical systems.</p>

            <p>We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the breakdown of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the N'{e}el transition, we accurately predict the N'{e}el temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and single-particle spectral functions, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Liu, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Yu-Jun Zhao</p>
            <p>The engineering of magnetic order and electronic states in two-dimensional (2D) materials is pivotal for advanced spintronic technologies. Despite their potential, the scarcity of intrinsic 2D ferromagnets remains a critical challenge. Here, we employ density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections to systematically investigate adsorbate-driven magnetic transitions in monolayer MnPSe3. While pristine MnPSe3 exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a semiconducting gap, Li, O, and F adatom adsorption induces an AFM-to-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) phase transition across large coverage ranges. Our calculations reveal enhanced thermodynamic stability at elevated coverages, with full-coverage configurations (Li0.5MnPSe3, MnPSe3O0.5, MnPSe3F0.5) favored energetically. Hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations show that F adsorption drives a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, whereas Li and O adsorption preserves semiconductivity. Moreover, Li adsorption induces a valley splitting of 20.3 meV at the K1 and K2 points in the band structure of the monolayer MnPSe3. Magnetic anisotropy analysis reveals adsorbate-dependent easy-axis reorientation: Li (electron doping) switches the easy-axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while O/F (hole doping) stabilizes in-plane easy-axis, consistent with carrier-density-modulation simulations. Crucially, carrier doping results indicate that once the electron doping concentration reaches critical concentration, the magnetic easy axis of monolayer MnPSe3 transitions from in-plane to out-of-plane. This work establishes atomic adsorption as a robust strategy for tailoring 2D magnetism, resolving discrepancies through rigorous treatment of exchange-correlation effects and configurational diversity.</p>

Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide new insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</p>

            <p>It is difficult to completely eliminate disorder during the fabrication of graphene-based nanodevices. From a simulation perspective, it is straightforward to determine the electronic transport properties of disordered devices if complete information about the disorder and the Hamiltonian describing it is available. However, to do the reverse and determine information about the nature of the disorder purely from transport measurements is a far more difficult task. In this work, we apply a recently developed inversion technique to identify important structural information about edge-disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons. The inversion tool decodes the electronic transmission spectrum to obtain the overall level of edge vacancies in this type of device. We also consider the role of spin-polarised states at the ribbon edges and demonstrate that, in addition to edge roughness, the inversion procedure can also be used to detect the presence of magnetism in such nanoribbons. We finally show that if the transmission for both spin orientations is available, for example by using ferromagnetic contacts in a transport measurement, then additional structural information about the relative concentration of defects on each edge can be derived.</p>

            <p>The protection against backscattering of spin-momentum-locked metallic edge states makes quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) highly appealing for spintronic applications, offering exceptional resilience against non-magnetic disorder. This protection arises from the time-reversal symmetry of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, which prohibits single-particle backscattering within a single Kramers pair. However, backscattering remains possible between energy-degenerate helical edge states not linked by time-reversal symmetry, as can occur in strongly non-linear edge dispersions with multiple Kramers pairs. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling of energy-degenerate helical edge states, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings extend the conventional understanding of backscattering protection beyond idealized linear dispersions to more realistic, nonlinear edge-mode configurations. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their topological protection.</p>

            <p>The search for chiral topological superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator (TI)-FeTe heterostructures is a key frontier in condensed matter physics, with potential applications in topological quantum computing. The combination of ferromagnetism, superconductivity, and topologically nontrivial surface states brings together the key elements required for chiral Majorana physics. In this work, we examine the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity at the interfaces between FeTe and a series of TI overlayers. In superconducting MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/FeTe, any interfacial suppression of antiferromagnetism must affect at most a few nanometers. On the other hand, (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$/FeTe layers exhibit near-total suppression of antiferromagnetic ordering. Ferromagnetic Cr$_x$(Bi,Sb)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ (CBST)/FeTe bilayers exhibit net magnetization in both CBST and FeTe layers, with evidence of interactions between superconductivity and ferromagnetism.

            <p>Cells attach to their environment by means of focal adhesions, which are molecular complexes that exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt to mechanical load by changing their size. Drawing from the biomolecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, we present a generic model for mechanically induced adhesion growth where conformational states of molecules already in the adhesion cluster are coupled to the adsorption of further molecules. For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Slow magnetic quantum oscillations in the c-axis magnetoresistance of UTe$_2$</h2>

            <p>Details of the electronic band structure in unconventional superconductors are key to the understanding of their fundamental ground state. The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Single-site quadrupolar Kondo effect in a diluted non-Kramers doublet system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ir$_2$Zn$_{20}$ for $x = 0.028$ viewed from magnetization</h2>

            <p>A diluted non-Kramers doublet system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ir$_2$Zn$_{20}$ is a promising candidate for exhibiting single-site quadrupolar (two-channel) Kondo effect. We have measured temperature-dependent magnetization of a sample for $x$ = 0.028 down to 0.1 K at various constant magnetic fields to extract the characteristic behaviors due to the quadrupolar Kondo effect. The Curie--Weiss fit to the magnetic susceptibility between 50 and 300 K yields a negative paramagnetic Curie temperature of $-$7.0 K, indicative of on-site antiferromagnetic interaction. The magnetization divided by magnetic field, $M(T)/B$, at $B = 0.5$ T is saturated to a constant value below 3 K. On the contrary, in higher magnetic fields of $B$ = 1 and 2 T, $M(T)/B$ exhibits $-$ln$T$ dependence from 1 to 0.1 K, which temperature dependence is consistent with that of the quadrupolar susceptibility detected from ultrasonic measurements. The $-$ln$T$ form of $M(T)/B$ appears to reflect the behavior of quadrupolar susceptibility, through the magnetic-field-induced magnetic moment due to the mixing of the non-Kramers doublet and crystalline-electric-field excited states of Pr$^{3+}$. In $B$ = 4 T, $M(T)/B$ approaches a constant on cooling below 0.3 K, because of the quenching of the quadrupoles in the field-induced singlet ground state.</p>

            <p>The BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) based Mott insulators of the form $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) host a correlated electron system on a triangular lattice of (BEDT-TTF)$^{+1}_2$ dimers. Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We identify the softening of collective dipole fluctuations through the charge order transition, consistent with electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate tuning in both directions across a second-order ferroelectric phase transition via uniaxial strain.</p>

            <p>An excitonic insulator$^{1,2}$ (EI) is a correlated many-body state of electron-hole pairs, potentially leading to high-temperature condensate and superfluidity$^{3-7}$. Despite ever-growing experiments suggesting possible EI states in various materials, direct proofs remain elusive and debated. Here we address the problem by introducing an ab initio methodology, enabling the parameter-free determination of electron-hole pairing order parameter and single-particle excitations within a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type formalism. Our calculations on monolayer 1T'-MoS$_{2}$$^{8,9}$ reveals that it is an unconventional EI with a transition temperature ~900K, breaking spontaneously the crystal's inversion, rotation, and mirror symmetries, while maintaining odd parity and unitarity. We identify several telltale spectroscopic signatures emergent in this EI phase that distinguish it from the band insulator (BI) phase, exemplified with a giant $\textbf{k}$-dependent $\textit{p}$-wave spin texture.</p>

            <p>Heat transfer is a fundamental property of matter. Research spanning decades has attempted to discover materials with exceptional thermal conductivity, yet the upper limit remains unknown. Using deep learning accelerated crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculation, we systematically explore the thermal conductivity landscape of inorganic crystals. We brute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an extensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four atoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal conductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable crystalline solids at ambient conditions. We identify over 20 novel crystals with high thermal conductivity surpassing silicon at room temperature validated by density functional theory. These include a series of metallic compounds, especially MnV, exhibiting high lattice and electronic thermal conductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. The fast deep learning-driven screening method, as well as the large comprehensive thermal conductivity database, pave the way for the discovery and design of next-generation materials with tailored thermal properties.</p>

            <p>We design an enhanced Event-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to study 1D quantum dissipative systems, using their bosonized representation. Expressing the bosonized Hamiltonian as a path integral over a scalar field enables the application of Monte Carlo algorithms developed for classical systems. Specifically, we focus on a dissipative XXZ spin chain, exhibiting critical slowing down, minima degeneracy and long-range interactions. Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</p>

            <p>The pristine state of hafnium based ferroelectric devices exhibits various unwanted properties, such as imprint and peak splitting, which diminish with bipolar cycling. The incorporation of a niobium oxide layer at different positions in metal-ferroelectric-metal and metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal stacks is used to modify the pristine state of the device. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements are used to investigate the influence of niobium oxide on the zirconium hafnium oxide layer. It is hypothesized that the charged vacancies generated by the introduced niobium oxide in the adjacent zirconium hafnium oxide layer result in an electric bias field that influences the pristine polarization state of the domains. A comparison of different stacks shows that peak splitting in the pristine state is most likely related to the formation of opposing electric bias fields in upwards and downwards polarized domains. Furthermore, the incorporation of niobium oxide in the zirconium hafnium oxide/aluminum oxide capacitor stack in between the ferroelectric and insulating layer leads to a peak splitting free device without imprint, which could be explained by the increased influence of charge trapping near the zirconium hafnium oxide-/niobium oxide and niobium oxide-/aluminum oxide interfaces.</p>

            <p>Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.</p>

            <p>The functional renormalization group (FRG) approach for spin models relying on a pseudo-fermionic description has proven to be a powerful technique in simulating ground state properties of strongly frustrated magnetic lattices. A drawback of the FRG framework is that it is formulated in the imaginary-time Matsubara formalism and thus only able to access static correlations, a limitation shared with most other many-body approaches. A description of the dynamical properties of magnetic systems is the key to bridging the gap between theory and neutron scattering spectra. We take the decisive step of expanding the scope of pseudo-fermion FRG to the Keldysh formalism, which, while originally developed to address non-equilibrium phenomena, enables a direct calculation of the equilibrium dynamical spin structure factors on generic lattices in arbitrary dimension. We identify the principal features characterizing the low-energy spectra of exemplary zero-, one- and two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models as well as the Kitaev honeycomb model.</p>

            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice with a coordination number of 3 using the thermal canonical tree tensor network method. Our findings reveal two distinct thermodynamic phases: a low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase, where spin SU(2) symmetry is broken, and a high-temperature paramagnetic phase. A key feature of the system is the separation of energy scales for charge and spin excitations, which is reflected in the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities and the disparity between spin and charge gaps extracted from their respective susceptibilities. At the critical point, both spin and charge susceptibilities exhibit singularities, suggesting that charge excitations are not fully decoupled from their spin counterparts. Additionally, the double occupancy number exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, indicative of an entropy-driven Pomeranchuk effect. These results demonstrate that the loopless Bethe lattice effectively captures the essential physics of the Hubbard model while providing a computationally efficient framework for studying strongly correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <p>The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>In living cells, cycles of formation and dissolution of liquid droplets can mediate biological functions such as DNA repair. However, the minimal physicochemical prerequisite for such droplet oscillations remains elusive. Here, we present a simple model composed of only two independent chemical components with their diffusive and chemical fluxes governed by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. There is turnover of fuel that maintains a chemical reaction away from equilibrium, leading to active droplets. We find that a single active droplet undergoes a pitchfork-bifurcation in the droplet volume upon increasing the fueling strength. Strikingly, the active droplet becomes excitable upon adding a further chemical reaction. For sufficient fueling, the system undergoes self-sustained oscillations cycling between droplet formation and dissolution. The minimal nature of our model suggests self-sustained active droplets as functional modules for de novo life.</p>

            <p>LP-N and HLP-N are promising high-energy-density materials. However, these materials synthesized under high pressure cannot be maintained stable at ambient conditions. The mechanism behind their instability remains unclear. Our research, based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that while not edge exposed, LP-N and HLP-N exhibit substantial structural, dynamic, and mechanical stability under ambient conditions. The stability of HLP-N is governed by an interlocking mechanism, which becomes ineffective upon exposure of the edges, leading to internal breakdown. As a result, H saturated adsorption has no impact on it. In contrast, LP-N benefits modestly from H saturated adsorption due to its edge-initiated dissociation. The interlocking mechanism offer valuable insights into the design of new materials.</p>

            <p>We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to the hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>The discrete rotational symmetry of crystals leads to the conservation of quantized angular momentum in solids. While the exchange of energy and linear momentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a cornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular momentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular momentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant magnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity, ultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process of phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach any magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena in solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of angular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical nonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold rotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify nonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel, confirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications for angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses the natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular momentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics, representing a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and chiral quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</p>

            <p>The adiabatic theorem states that when the time evolution of the Hamiltonian is "infinitely slow", a system, when started in the ground state, remains in the instantaneous ground state at all times. This, however, does not mean that the adiabatic evolution of a generic observable obtains simply as its expectation value over the instantaneous eigenstate. As a general principle there is an additional adiabatic term, of quantum-geometrical nature, which is the relevant one for several static or adiabatic observables. This is shown explicitly for the cases of polarizability and infrared tensors (in molecules and condensed matter); rotational g factor and magnetizability (in molecules only). Quantum geometry allows for a transparent derivation and a compact expression for these observables, alternative to the well known sum-over-states Kubo formulas.</p>

            <p>Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state, or implementing a unitary, using limited resources. Over the past decade, quantum-complexity research has surged. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter and quantum gravity. Different communities apply different tools to quantum complexity, as well as define complexity differently. This review bridges the disciplines' approaches. We cover multiple definitions of complexity, as well as their key properties and applications. In quantum information, random quantum circuits proved to be an invaluable tool in extracting properties of the complexity growth of discrete quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), complexity is defined geometrically through geodesics. Complexity can be defined also in terms of state or operator spreading and tensor-network concepts. In addition to reviewing these approaches, we outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models and QFTs, including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we detail the relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the anti-de Sitter-space (AdS)/CFT correspondence.

            <p>We introduce a notion of chirality for generic quantum states. A chiral state is defined as a state which cannot be transformed into its complex conjugate in a local product basis using local unitary operations. We introduce a number of quantitative measures of chirality which vanish for non-chiral states. A faithful measure called the "chiral log-distance" is defined in terms of the maximum fidelity between the state and its complex conjugate under local unitary transformations. We further introduce a set of computable measures that involve nested commutators of modular Hamiltonians. We show general relations between chirality and the amount of "magic" or non-stabilizer resource in a state. We first show that stabilizer states of qubits are non-chiral. Furthermore, magic monotones such as the stabilizer nullity and the stabilizer fidelity are lower-bounded by the chiral log-distance. We further relate chirality to discord-like quantum correlations. We define a measure of discord-like correlations called the intrinsic interferometric power, and show that it is lower-bounded by a nested commutator chirality measure. One interesting aspect of chirality is that it is not monotonic under local partial traces, indicating that it is a unique kind of resource that is not captured by traditional quantum resource theories.</p>

We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.</p>

            <p>Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. To realize superradiance, excited electric dipoles must be arranged in the same orientation with spacing much smaller than the wavelength of the excitation light. While previous studies have accidentally observed superradiance through the random aggregation of quantum dots and organic dyes, a deterministic approach for the materialization of superradiant has yet to be established. Herein, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p>

            <h2>Water is a superacid at extreme thermodynamic conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Thévenet, Axel Dian, Alexis Markovits, Sandro Scandolo, Arthur France-Lanord, Flavio Siro Brigiano</p>
            <p>The chemical behavior of water under extreme pressures and temperatures lies at the heart of processes shaping planetary interiors, influences the deep carbon cycle, and underpins innovative high-temperature, high-pressure synthesis of materials. Recent experiments reveal that hydrocarbons immersed in ionized water under extreme conditions transform into heavy hydrocarbons and nanodiamonds. However, the chemistry of water at extreme conditions and its role in hydrocarbon condensation remains poorly understood. Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling techniques and machine-learning interatomic potentials, we show that increasing pressure at high temperature induces water ionization, creating a superacid-like environment that favors the protonation of hydrocarbons into transient pentacoordinated carbonium ions like CH$_5^+$. These elusive intermediates release molecular hydrogen and yield highly reactive carbocations, driving hydrocarbon chain growth toward nanodiamonds. We demonstrate how the combination of water ionization and pressure-induced methane polarization leads to superacid-driven hydrocarbon chemistry, famously known at far milder conditions. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a superacid aqueous regime and establish the existence of superacid chemistry under extreme conditions. Moreover, they provide a unifying reaction network that explains chemical transformations in environments such as planetary interiors and high pressure, high temperature experiments.</p>

            <h2>A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijie Feng, Emmy Blumenthal, Pankaj Mehta, Akshit Goyal</p>
            <p>Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.</p>

            <p>Extraneous high frequency chip modes parasitic to superconducting quantum circuits can result in decoherence when these modes are excited. To suppress these modes, superconducting air bridges (AB) are commonly used to electrically connect ground planes together when interrupted by transmission lines. Here, we demonstrate the use of two-photon photolithography to build a supporting 3D resist structure in conjunction with a lift-off process to create AB. The resulting aluminum AB, have a superconducting transition temperature $T_{c} = 1.08$ K and exhibit good mechanical strength up to lengths of 100 $\mu$m. A measurable amount of microwave loss is observed when 35 AB were placed over a high-$Q$ Ta quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonator.</p>

            <h2>Resonant optical bistability in support of enhanced Rydberg atom sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter B. Weichman</p>
            <p>Radio frequency antennas based on highly excited Rydberg atom vapors can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. Conventional Rydberg sensors are based on individual atom response, with increased signal resolution relying on the $O(10^3)$ electric dipole moment enhancement, scaling as the square of the Rydberg state principal quantum number $N \sim 50$. However, despite more than thirty years of steady advances, beyond-classical signal sensitivity has yet to be demonstrated. More recently, the optical bistability effect, a many body nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at somewhat higher vapor densities, has been exploited for an order of magnitude or more increased sensitivity for some setups through tuning into the critical region. However, the results fall significantly short of those using more advanced ``conventional'' Rydberg sensor setups -- which achieve even greater enhancement by exploiting resonant interaction between a pair of nearby Rydberg levels. This paper seeks to \emph{combine} the many body and resonant enhancement effects by extending the bistable phase analysis to include a pair of resonant Rydberg levels, supported by an exact treatment of the atom velocity thermal average. A dynamic linear response formalism is developed as well to explore the tradeoff between measurement sensitivity and finite bandwidth signals. We demonstrate regions of the phase diagram which could be exploited for record breaking, beyond-classical sensitivity. Of course, only a limited number of vapor parameters are under full experimental control, and experiments will be needed to quantitatively constrain the effective mean field interaction parameters appearing in the theory, and thereby define the accessible regions of the phase diagram.</p>

            <p>Accurate quantum chemistry calculations are essential for understanding electronic structures, yet exactly solving the many-body Schrödinger equation remains impractical due to electron correlation effects. While Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used, its inherent approximations limit its ability to capture strong correlation effects, particularly in surface reactions. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, especially for localized electron interactions. In this work, we apply a quantum embedding approach to study the Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Lithium battery electrode surfaces. We employ an active space selection strategy, using Density Difference Analysis to identify key orbitals, which are subsequently refined with coupled-cluster natural orbitals. These are treated using Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended version (Ext-SQD), leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatz for efficient state preparation on quantum hardware. Ext-SQD significantly improves upon standard SQD by incorporating excitation operators into the quantum-computed electron configurations used in classical Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy over Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) calculations over ground state energies. The results, validated against Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI), whenever computationally feasible, and Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (HCI), provide new insights into $\mathrm{Li}$-$\mathrm{O_2}$ surface reactions, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in materials discovery and reaction modeling.</p>

            <h2>Incident beam optics optimization for the single crystal neutron diffractometer Pioneer with a polarized beam option</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaohua Liu, Peter Torres</p>
            <p>Pioneer, a next-generation single-crystal neutron diffractometer, is under development for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Second Target Station (STS). Designed to address a wide range of scientific questions, Pioneer will deliver homogeneous neutron beams with customizable size and divergence, and provide a polarized beam option. This article introduces its incident beam optics, highlighting the optimization methodology and the simulated performance. Pioneer will utilize a modified elliptical-straight guide for neutron transport and deploy slit packages and insertable apertures to control beam size and divergence. The optimized guide geometry matches the optimal-and-full-sample-illumination condition, and the beam control system effectively filters out unwanted neutrons while preserving the desired ones. Additionally, we have found that polygon-approximated guides provide satisfactory transport efficiency and beam homogeneity, eliminating the need of truly curved guides. To enhance neutronics performance and reduce cost, the coatings of supermirror elements are individually optimized to the lowest half-integer $m$-values that are sufficient to deliver the desired neutrons. After evaluating polarizing V-cavities and $^3$He spin filters over the default polarized wavelength band of 1.2-5.5~Å, we selected a translatable multichannel polarizing V-cavity as the incident beam polarizer. Strategically placed at a location where the beam divergence is low and a large in-guide gap has negligible impact on transport efficiency, the optimized V-cavity achieves an average $P^2T$ of approximately 35\%.</p>

            <p>Given a known or unknown phase encoded in a higher-dimensional qudit gate, it is possible to send copies of a gate that encodes the phase to multiple receivers based on a generalized quantum teleportation. We extend this quantum gate broadcast protocol to a quantum network on directed acyclic graphs in which agents can add phase gates to be distributed and pass unknown phase gates to subsequent receivers. Similarly to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, we show that the resource state can be efficiently prepared in finite time.</p>

            <h2>Charge Parity Rates in Transmon Qubits with Different Shunting Capacitors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Hsiang Huang, Haozhi Wang, Yizhou Huang, Sylvie McKnight-Milles, Zachary Steffen, B. S. Palmer</p>
            <p>The presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting resonators and qubits operating at millikelvin temperature has been known for decades. One metric for the number of quasiparticles affecting qubits is the rate of single-electron change in charge on the qubit island ($\textit i.e.$ the charge parity rate). Here, we have utilized a Ramsey-like pulse sequence to monitor changes in the parity states of five transmon qubits. The five qubits have shunting capacitors with two different geometries and fabricated from both Al and Ta. The charge parity rate differs by a factor of two for the two transmon designs studied here but does not depend on the material of the shunting capacitor. The underlying mechanism of the source of parity switching is further investigated in one of the qubit devices by increasing the quasiparticle trapping rate using induced vortices in the electrodes of the device. The charge parity rate exhibited a weak dependence on the quasiparticle trapping rate, indicating that the main source of charge parity events is from the production of quasiparticles across the Josephson junction. To estimate this source of quasiparticle production, we simulate and estimate pair-breaking photon absorption rates for our two qubit geometries and find a similar factor of two in the absorption rate for a background blackbody radiation temperature of $T^*\sim$ 350 mK.</p>

            <h2>Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Huai-Bing Zhu, Xuan Zuo, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. V. Mousavi</p>
            <p>This study investigates the effects of decoherence and squeezing on the dynamics of various kinds of quantum features--local quantum coherence, local entropy, EPR correlations, and entanglement--in the high-temperature limit of the double Caldeira-Leggett model, focusing on initially squeezed states. We compare two scenarios: (1) particles interacting with distinct environments and (2) particles coupled to a common environment. Our analysis reveals that common environments better preserve local coherence over time, whereas distinct environments accelerate decoherence. Temperature enhances decoherence and suppresses coherence revivals, while squeezing affects transient dynamics but not long-term coherence saturation. Local entropy increases with temperature and squeezing, though their underlying physical mechanisms differ. EPR correlations degrade due to environmental interactions, with squeezing initially enhancing them but failing to prevent their eventual loss. Entanglement exhibits distinct behaviors: in separate environments, it undergoes sudden death, whereas in common environments, it experiences a dark period whose duration shortens with stronger squeezing. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how decoherence and squeezing influence quantum correlations in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faysal Rahman, Abdul Ahad Mamun, Auronno Ovid Hussain, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder</p>
            <p>Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H$_2$) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by depositing a $\beta$-MnO$_2$ monolayer on a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) and systematically investigate its electrocatalytic properties. This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites -- Osub-top and bridge sites -- on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{\rm H}$) of $-0.015$ eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C ($-0.082$ eV) and Ir ($-0.08$ eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density $(J_{0,c})$ of OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100) reaches $10^{-0.774}$ Acm$^{-2}$, outperforming Pt/C ($10^{-0.92}$ Acm$^{-2}$) and Ir ($10^{-1.44}$ Acm$^{-2}$). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential $(\eta_{a,c})$ of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm$^{-2}$ in a 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ at an applied voltage ($V_{\rm app}$) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO$_2$-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.</p>

            <p>The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we demonstrate that SVD fails to correctly reproduce the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swetha Nair, Guillaume Jeanmairet, Benjamin Rotenberg</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between electronic screening inside a metal and screening by a polar molecular solvent, focusing on their impact on the charge induced by an ion and the solvent structure at the interface. To that end, we consider atomistically resolved electrodes within the Thomas-Fermi model of screening and describe the molecular solvent either explicitly via classical molecular dynamics or implicitly using Molecular Density Functional Theory (MDFT). Specifically, we examine the effect of screening by tuning the Thomas-Fermi screening length $l_\text{TF}$, the ion charge by considering Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ and the solvent nature by studying water and acetonitrile. Consistently with our previous findings without solvent, $l_\text{TF}$ significantly affects the charge distribution inside the metal. However, $l_\text{TF}$ has no significant impact on the interfacial solvent structure, suggesting that its effect on the charge distribution induced inside the metal by the ion is essentially due to how the metal responds to the (same) external charge distribution, including the solvent, even though the coupling between both sides of the interface may play a secondary role. Furthermore, MDFT accurately reproduces fine details of the interfacial solvent structure around the ion at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. These results highlight the relevance of MDFT as a powerful tool to model electrochemical systems at the molecular level.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of inverting the artifacts associated with scanning a page from an open book, i.e. "xeroxing." The process typically leads to a non-uniform combination of distortion, blurring and darkening owing to the fact that the page is bound to a stiff spine that causes the sheet of paper to be bent inhomogeneously. Complementing purely data-driven approaches, we use knowledge about the geometry and elasticity of the curved sheet to pose and solve a minimal physically consistent inverse problem to reconstruct the image. Our results rely on 3 dimensionless parameters, all of which can be measured for a scanner, and show that we can improve on the data-driven approaches. More broadly, our results might serve as a "textbook" example and a tutorial of how knowledge of generative mechanisms can speed up the solution of inverse problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamison Sloan, Sachin Vaidya, Nicholas Rivera, Marin Soljačić</p>
            <p>Multimode nonlinear optical systems are highly valued for their ability to withstand large amounts of optical power, transmit data with high bandwidth, perform physical computations, generate quantum correlations, and much more. For many of these applications, both classical and quantum noise place limitations on important performance metrics. Moreover, it is well known that nonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be used to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that non-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the non-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for isolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise. Our findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or oscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of noise. Moreover, our approach provides a new means to connect non-Hermitian topology with nonlinear many-body systems, which is expected to lead to topological descriptions of interacting states of light.</p>

            <h2>Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kilian Fraboulet</p>
            <p>The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Padé-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.</p>

            <p>Potassium sodium niobate is considered a prominent material system as a substitute for lead-containing ferroelectric materials. It exhibits first-order phase transformations and ferroelectricity with potential applications ranging from energy conversion to innovative cooling technologies, thereby addressing important societal challenges. However, a major obstacle in the application of potassium sodium niobate is its multi-scale heterogeneity and the lack of understanding of its phase transition pathway and microstructure. This can be seen from the findings of Pop-Ghe et al. (Ceram Int 47(14):20579-20585, 2021, this https URL) which also reveal the occurrence of a phenomenon they term intermediate twinning during the phase transition. Here, we show that intermediate twinning is a consequence of energy minimization. We develop a geometrically nonlinear electroelastic energy function for potassium sodium niobate, including the cubic-tetragonal-orthorhombic transformations and ferroelectricity. The construction of the minimizers is based on compatibility conditions which ensure continuous deformations and pole-free interfaces. These minimizers agree with the experimental observations, including laminates between tetragonal variants under the cubic to tetragonal transformation, crossing twins under the tetragonal to orthorhombic transformation, intermediate twinning and spontaneous polarization. This shows how the full nonlinear electroelastic model provides a powerful tool in understanding, exploring, and tailoring the electromechanical properties of complex ferroelectric ceramics.</p>

            <p>An electrical current that flows across individual atoms can generate exotic quantum transport signatures in model junctions built using atomic tip or lateral techniques. So far, however, a viable industrial pathway for atom-driven devices has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that a commercialized device platform can fill this nanotechnological gap. According to conducting tip atomic force microscopy, inserting C atoms into the MgO barrier of a magnetic tunnel junction generates nanotransport paths. Within magnetotransport experiments, this results in quantum interferences, and in Pauli spin blockade effects linked to tunneling magnetoresistance peaks that can be electrically controlled. We report an additional persistent memory effect that we attribute to the charging of a single "gating" C atom that is adjacent to a single C atom forming the microscale junction's effective nanotranport path. Local magnetometry experiments confirm the secondary role of magnetic stray fields on the C atoms. Our results show that, to exhibit atom-level properties, a device need not be nanoscaled, and position MgO tunneling spintronics as a promising platform to industrially implement quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Tyn Kai Chung, Michel J. P. Gingras</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel geometrically frustrated classical Ising model, dubbed the "spin vorticity model", whose ground state manifold is a novel classical spin liquid, a "2-form Coulomb phase". We study the thermodynamics of this model both analytically and numerically, exposing the presence of algebraically decaying correlations and demonstrating an extensive ground state entropy, and give a comprehensive account of its ground state properties and excitations. Each classical ground state may be decomposed into collections of closed 2-dimensional membranes, supporting fractionalized string excitations attached to the boundaries of open membranes. At finite temperature, the model can then be described as a gas of closed strings in a background of fluctuating membranes. We demonstrate that the emergent gauge structure of the low-temperature phase is naturally captured in the formalism of 2-form electrodynamics, which describes 1-dimensional charged strings coupled to a rank-2 anti-symmetric gauge field. After establishing the classical spin vorticity model, we consider perturbing it with quantum exchange interactions, from which we derive an effective membrane exchange model of the quantum dynamics of these membranes, which maps to a frustrated 2-form U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show the existence of a fine-tuned Rokhsar-Kivelson point where the quantum ground state is an equal weight superposition of all classical ground state configurations. We further demonstrate how to quantize the string excitations, by coupling a 1-form string field to the emergent 2-form U(1) gauge field, thus mapping a quantum spin model to a 2-form gauge-Higgs model. We discuss the stability of the gapless deconfined phase of this gauge theory and the possibility of realizing a novel class of phases of quantum matter: 2-form U(1) quantum spin liquids.</p>

They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability - a so-called quantum critical point - at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum fluctuations. Here we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe$_2$ possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three Cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the three-dimensional transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality - a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits a magnetic field-induced superconducting state in a toroidal shape, which persists to fields over 70~T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion, and show how a three-dimensional quantum critical phase boundary - rather than a more conventional singular point of instability - anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Electron-Phonon Coupling in Many-Body Perturbation Theory: Developments within the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW approximation and LMTO Formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savio Laricchia, Casey Eichstaedt, Dimitar Pashov, Mark van Schilfgaarde</p>
            <p>The calculation of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling from first principles is a topic of great interest in materials science, offering a robust, non-empirical framework to understand and predict a wide range of physical phenomena. While significant progress has been made using the Kohn-Sham framework of density functional theory (KS-DFT), it is increasingly evident that standard approximations in KS-DFT often fall short of providing accurate results. These shortcomings are frequently linked to the non-local nature of the exchange-correlation potential, prompting the development of advanced methodologies within DFT and many-body perturbation theory. Despite these efforts, a highly reliable and efficient first-principles approach to accurately capture e-ph interactions remains elusive. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel field-theoretical methodology that integrates the foundational work of Baym and Hedin with the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, implemented within the Questaal electronic structure suite. Our approach, based on a response function framework, ensures that Pulay-like incomplete-basis-set corrections are not required to account for changes in basis functions, paving the way for a high-fidelity description of e-ph coupling.</p>

            <p>We theoretically propose a polymer-based nano-device consisting of a single trans-polyacetylene (tPA) molecule capacitively coupled to external voltage gates. We model the integrated device using a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate the emergence of localized domain walls (DWs) with quantized charges (i.e., soliton excitations) localized at the gates. Interestingly, by increasing the applied voltage, multiple discrete charges can be accumulated, which may be useful for potential technological applications. Exploiting the topological character of the solitonic excitations of tPA, this device can be considered as an organic-based quantum dot with a very large and robust quantized charge.</p>

            <p>Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p>We propose a method to evaluate the Gibbs free energy from constant-volume first-principles phonon calculations. The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Grüneisen parameter without varying the volume. We validate our method for fcc Al by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation. Furthermore, we integrate our method with self-consistent phonon theory and apply it to calculations for bcc Ti, hcp Ti, and tetragonal ZrO$_2$. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method by comparing results with those obtained from directly volume-varied self-consistent phonon calculations. In all cases, our method accurately evaluates the free energy change due to thermal expansion using only constant-volume phonon calculations.</p>

            <h2>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Mukherjee, Haoyu Guo, Keiran Lewellen, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</p>

Combined with emerging multi-material capabilities and printable responsive materials, this opens new possibilities for digital composite materials and 3D printing of shape-transforming structures, or 4D printing. Building upon these advancements, we devise a novel methodology for crafting digitized 4D-printed shape-transforming sheets. We 3D print responsive sheets composed of two layers, each consisting of active and passive voxels meticulously positioned to form thin structures that can be actuated on demand. Our approach solves a long-standing problem in the field, i.e., the independent and simultaneous programming of lateral geometry and reference curvature.

We here present how the analysis based on the use of this key quantity can be applied to the study of the properties of coupled layers. To this aim, we first discuss how to extend the popular worm algorithm to a layered sample, and in particular to the evaluation of the longitudinal helicity, that we introduce taking care of the fact that the virtual twist representing the elastic deformation one applies to properly define the helicity modulus can act on a single layer or on all of them. We then apply the method to investigate the bilayer XY-model, showing how the helicity modulus can be used to determine the phase diagram of the model as a function of temperature and inter-layer coupling strength</p>

Upon investigation of the bulk spectrum for large finite size droplets, we identify a gapless chiral $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state featuring spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking.

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naratip Nunchot, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>Phase diagrams and electronic transport properties of the helical states in purely two-dimensional (2D) Rashba superconductors coupled with in-plane Zeeman fields are studied. The continuum XY action is derived microscopically by integrating out the Gaussian amplitude fluctuation from the effective action. We show that the superfluid stiffness obtained from this procedure is exactly equivalent to the second-order derivative of the mean-field free energy density with respect to Cooper pair momentum, indicating an essential role of the amplitude fluctuation. The vortex core energy is also included in this work, and its effects on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition line are discussed. The theory of nonlinear V-I characteristics in purely 2D superconductors is also revised to incorporate recent developments in the theory of the superconducting diode effect. The main results are as follows. We find that the nonlinear V-I characteristics of the system become nonreciprocal in finite in-plane Zeeman fields. This is reminiscent of the superconducting diode effect in 2D systems, although the critical current is zero in purely 2D superconductors. Furthermore, we find that the bare effective superfluid stiffness along the BKT transition line has a local minimum at a certain temperature, and the nonreciprocity of the V-I characteristics is strongly enhanced around this temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios H. Michael, Duilio De Santis, Eugene A. Demler, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$ (YBCO), where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a \textit{local} superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We show how this scenario can fit most of the available data. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. While the bulk of this paper addresses the experiment on YBCO, this work reveals a new instability in the sine-Gordon equation that is of fundamental interest, with potential applications such as providing a mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales in Josephson devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ádám Bácsi, Balázs Dóra</p>
            <p>We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting order parameter in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. In the absence of superconductivity, its ground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK interaction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but leaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out the non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which contains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude vanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also investigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase transition, and find that its non-analytic temporal behaviour is close but does not match exactly the vanishing of the order parameter. The momentum space entanglement entropy between positive and negative momentum modes, relevant for Cooper pairing, is calculated. Counterintuitively, this momentum space entanglement does not change significantly during the quench dynamics and its value remains reasonably large even for vanishing superconducting order parameter. Nevertheless, its derivative with respect to the HK interaction signals the dynamical phase transition associated to the late time vanishing of superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>On the phase diagram of extensive-rank symmetric matrix denoising beyond rotational invariance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Justin Ko, Koki Okajima</p>
            <p>Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its statistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and an efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a \emph{denoising-factorisation transition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself, becomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of [3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we conjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality when it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole phase diagram when considering finite size effects.</p>

            <p>We analyze the quantum Hopfield model in which an extensive number of patterns are embedded in the presence of a uniform transverse field. This analysis employs the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz on the Suzuki-Trotter representation of the model, while keeping the number of Trotter slices $M$ finite. The statistical properties of the quantum Hopfield model in imaginary time are reduced to an effective $M$-spin long-range classical Ising model, which can be extensively studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm. This approach contrasts with the commonly applied static approximation, which ignores the imaginary time dependency of the order parameters, but allows $M \to \infty$ to be taken analytically. During the analysis, we introduce an exact but fundamentally weaker static relation, referred to as the quasi-static relation. We present the phase diagram of the model with respect to the transverse field strength and the number of embedded patterns, indicating a small but quantitative difference from previous results obtained using the static approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke C. Rhodes, Dylan C. Houston, Olivia R. Armitage, Peter Wahl</p>
            <p>Moiré lattices are a general feature of bilayer structures, where an additional periodic superstructure is generated by either lattice mismatch or from a twist angle. They have been shown to stabilise new ground states, including unconventional superconductivity and Mott insulating phases, attributed to strong electron correlations. However, controlling these interactions requires a detailed understanding of the low energy electronic structure which is lacking so far. Probing the electronic structure is challenging due to sample inhomogeneity, the low characteristic energy scales involved and small sample sizes. Through quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) can overcome many of these challenges but requires detailed modelling to extract the $k$-space electronic structure. Here, we present realistic calculations of QPI in twisted bilayer structures, which accounts for the effect of the long range moiré lattice on the electronic structure as well as it's interaction at a defect. These calculations reveal that while the moiré supercell significantly reduces the size of the Brillouin zone, the QPI scattering vectors retain characteristics of the individual monolayers with distinct perturbations from the twisted geometry that can be directly linked back to the electronic structure. The procedure introduced here provides a general framework to use QPI to determine the low energy electronic structure in moiré lattice systems.</p>

            <p>The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</p>

While a previous study on powder samples exhibited intriguing magnetic behavior, questions about whether the spin state within a Ru$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimer is a conventional $S = 3/2$ dimer or an orbital-selective $S = 1$ dimer were raised. The RIXS spectra reveal magnetic excitations from Hund's intraionic multiplet and intradimer spin-triplet transitions. The observed transition energies of the Hund's intraionic multiplets align with the $S=3/2$ ground state, contrasting with the theoretically proposed orbital-selective $S=1$ dimer state. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility analysis confirms the realization of the spin $S=3/2$ dimer state, and the extracted intradimer coupling is consistent with the spin-triplet transition energy observed in the RIXS spectra. These results highlights the ability of "spectroscopic fingerprinting" by RIXS to determine the magnetic ground states of complex materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malena T. Bauer, Udo Seifert, Jann van der Meer</p>
            <p>A major goal of stochastic thermodynamics is to estimate the inevitable dissipation that accompanies particular observable phenomena in an otherwise not fully accessible system. Quantitative results are often formulated as lower bounds on the total entropy production, which capture the part of the total dissipation that can be determined based on the available data alone. In this work, we discuss the case of a continuous-time dynamics on a Markov network that is observed stroboscopically, i.e., at discrete points in time in regular intervals. We compare the standard approach of deriving a lower bound on the entropy production rate in the steady state to the less common method of reconstructing the generator from the observed propagators by taking the matrix logarithm. Provided that the timescale of the stroboscopic measurements is smaller than a critical value that can be determined from the available data, this latter method is able to recover all thermodynamic quantities like entropy production or cycle affinities and is therefore superior to the usual approach of deriving lower bounds. Beyond the critical value, we still obtain tight upper and lower bounds on these quantities that improve on extant methods. We conclude the comparison with numerical illustrations and a discussion of the requirements and limitations of both methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiansen Zhang, Zipeng Wang, Shina Tan</p>
            <p>We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume $D$ appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions (we assume that the three fermions have the same mass), and $s_1,s_2,s_3$ are the sides of the triangle. We compute the $T$-matrix element for three such fermions colliding at low energy in terms of $D$ in the absence of two-body interactions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three two-component fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rates in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rates in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> EJ Janse van Rensburg, E Orlandini, MC Tesi</p>
            <p>In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of a large magnetic nonlinear Hall effect in an altermagnet</h2>

            <p>Since Edwin Halls groundbreaking discovery of the Hall effect in 1879, magnetism, spin, and quantization have been expanding the scope of Hall effects, continuously driving transformative progress in science and technology. Among them, the latest nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), where longitudinal electric field tunes quantum geometry to generate nonlinear Hall voltage, attracts wide attention as a sensitive probe of topological phases across a wide range of materials. Here, we report a new Hall effect member: the magnetic nonlinear Hall effect (MNLHE), characterized by a quadratic Hall conductivity dependence on magnetic field, rather than electric field as in NLHE. This finding relies on an altermagnet, Mn5Si3 thin film, whose alternating-sign Berry curvatures ensure higher-order MNLHE clearly distinguishable from the first-order anomalous Hall effect. The observed quadratic dependence originates from chiral next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes that acquire magnetic-exchange-driven Zeeman energies and Haldane-like chiral flux phases. Remarkably, this MNLHE is non-analytic, as reversing the magnetic field flips the alternating spin-splitting bands and reverses the hopping chirality, which is absent in traditional NLHE. Beyond offering a distinctive transport fingerprint for altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film, this MNLHE is large and unsaturated up to 60 T, providing opportunities for pulsed high-field sensing technologies in both fundamental researches and engineering applications.</p>

            <h2>Towards a global phase diagram of Ce-based dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets under magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengbang Zhou, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have established a strong case for Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$ to host $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). However, an irrefutable conclusion still requires strong, multifaceted evidence. In dipolar-octupolar (DO) compounds, external magnetic fields only strongly couple with the dipolar component $\tau_z$ along its local z-axis in contrast to octupolar components $\tau^{x,y}$. This gives rise to the unique ways magnetic fields interact with the system and, in turn, provides us with a variety of tuning knobs to generate comprehensive experimental results. In this work, we focus on magnetic fields along the (110), (111), and (001) directions and present a plethora of remarkable experimental signatures to probe the underlying physics of $\pi$-flux QSI using gauge mean field theory (GMFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we present unique signatures in magnetic field-dependent phase diagrams, equal-time and dynamical structure factors, and magnetostriction.</p>

            <h2>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanran Shi, Bo Xie, Fengfan Ren, Xinyu Cai, Zhongqing Guo, Qiao Li, Xin Lu, Nicolas Regnault, Zhongkai Liu, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moiré heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is well benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Monolayer Chromium Dihalides and Trihalides materials can be grown on a variety of substrates by molecular beam epitaxy regardless of the lattice mismatch thanks to the van der Waals epitaxy. In this work, we studied the magnetic nature of Cr Chloride monolayers grown on Au(111), Ni(111) and graphene-passivated Ni(111) from the evaporation in ultra-high vacuum of the same halide precursor. Structural, morphological and magnetic characterizations were conducted in situ by low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Owing to opposite chemical behaviour, Au(111) and Ni(111) promote the formation of two different valence compounds, i.e. CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, showing distinct magnetic properties at 4 K. When graphene is used to passivate the Ni(111) surface, the formation of CrCl$_3$ becomes allowed also on this substrate. The coexistence of CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, both showing few nm lateral size and super-paramagnetic properties, is demonstrated by XMCD spectra displaying two dichroic peaks at the characteristic Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{2+}$ energies. Site-selective magnetization measurements performed with the photon energy tuned on the two absorption edges show reversed magnetization of some of the CrCl$_2$ islands with respect to the CrCl3 domains, which is interpreted in terms of magnetic frustration.</p>

            <p>Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetsuya Nomoto, Akiko Kikkawa, Kazuki Nakazawa, Terufumi Yamaguchi, Fumitaka Kagawa</p>
            <p>The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic evidence for spin-spinless stripe order with reduced Ni moments within $ab$ plane for bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ probed by $^{139}$La-NQR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mitsuharu Yashima, Nina Seto, Yujiro Oshita, Masataka Kakoi, Hiroya Sakurai, Yoshihiko Takano, Hidekazu Mukuda</p>
            <p>The intrinsic electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ have been selectively investigated by nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) at the La(2) site outside the NiO$_2$ bilayers. The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.</p>

            <p>Under an externally applied load, granular packings form force chains that depend on the contact network and moduli of the grains. In this work, we investigate packings of variable modulus (VM) particles, where we can direct force chains by changing the Young's modulus of individual particles within the packing on demand. Each VM particle is made of a silicone shell that encapsulates a core made of a low-melting-point metallic alloy (Field's metal). By sending an electric current through a co-located copper heater, the Field's metal internal to each particle can be melted via Joule heating, which softens the particle. As the particle cools to room temperature, the alloy solidifies and the particle recovers its original modulus. To optimize the mechanical response of granular packings containing both soft and stiff particles, we employ an evolutionary algorithm coupled with discrete element method simulations to predict the patterns of particle moduli that will yield specific force outputs on the assembly boundaries. The predicted patterns of particle moduli from the simulations were realized in experiments using 2D assemblies of VM particles and the force outputs on the assembly boundaries were measured using photoelastic techniques. These studies represent a step towards making robotic granular metamaterials that can dynamically adapt their mechanical properties in response to different environmental conditions or perform specific tasks on demand.</p>

            <p>We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light driving. The transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.</p>

            <p>The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electron states is an essential ingredient for topological and quantum geometric quantities in solids. For example, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta are a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as circular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by proxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and momentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit angle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as evidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD originates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic contributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken inversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly examine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe of intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of incident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the surface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in virtually all bulk bands. Since OAM is forbidden by inversion symmetry in the bulk, we conclude this originates from symmetry-breaking in the photoemission process. Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and suggests that $\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each unit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including inter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the rapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael O. Atambo, Korir Kiptiemoi</p>
            <p>The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.</p>

            <p>The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Exact Quantum Dynamics, Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, and Quantum Quenches in Strongly-Correlated Many-Body Systems: The Time-Dependent Jastrow Ansatz</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Yang, Adolfo del Campo</p>
            <p>The description of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium presents a fundamental challenge due to the vast amount of information it requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wavefunctions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.</p>

            <p>We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of spin models.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the impurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications in quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced counter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.</p>

            <p>"Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</p>

            <p>Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</p>

            <p>In thermalizing many-body quantum systems without conservation laws such as ergodic Floquet and random unitary circuits, local expectation values are predicted to decay to their equilibrium values exponentially quickly. In this work we derive a relationship between said exponential decay rate $\overline{g}$ and the operator spreading properties of a local unitary evolution. A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems. These conjectures are in accordance with existing results which numerically obtain quantum many-body analogues of classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances [T. Prosen J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 L737 (2002), T. Mori, arXiv:2311.10304] by studying unitary evolutions subject to weak dissipation.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Hall liquids in high-density QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Nishimura, Naoki Yamamoto, Ryo Yokokura</p>
            <p>There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry a baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</p>

            <h2>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pramod Padmanabhan, Vladimir Korepin</p>
            <p>Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from solutions of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Apart from these we show that solutions constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions and Clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. Furthermore it is observed that the Clifford solutions give rise to positive Boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. Finally we also show that anti-Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions.</p>

            <p>We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.</p>

            <h2>First-Passage Approach to Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagi Meir, Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni, Barak Hirshberg</p>
            <p>Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie</p>
            <p>As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.</p>

            <p>Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</p>

            <h2>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien</p>
            <p>We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</p>

            <p>Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moiré bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular Néel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Andrei Bernevig, Yves H. Kwan</p>
            <p>We present a model for interacting electrons in a continuum band structure that resembles a ``trashcan'', with a flat bottom of radius $k_b$ beyond which the dispersion increases rapidly with velocity $v$. The form factors of the Bloch wavefunctions can be well-approximated by the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, which encodes the uniform Berry curvature. We demonstrate how this model captures the salient features of the low-energy Hamiltonian for electron-doped pristine $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene (R$n$G) for appropriate values of the displacement field, and provide corresponding expressions for $k_b$. In the regime where the Fermi wavevector is close to $k_b$, we analytically solve the Hartree-Fock equations for a gapped Wigner crystal in several limits of the model. We introduce a new method, the sliver-patch approximation, which extends the previous few-patch approaches and is crucial in both differentiating even vs odd Chern numbers of the ground state and gapping the Hartree-Fock solution. A key parameter is the Berry flux $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ enclosed by the (flat) bottom of the band. We analytically show that there is a ferromagnetic coupling between the signs of $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ and the Chern number $C$ of the putative Wigner crystal. We also study the competition between the $C=0$ and $1$ solutions as a function of the interaction potential for parameters relevant to R$n$G. By exhaustive comparison to numerical Hartree-Fock calculations, we demonstrate how the analytic results capture qualitative trends of the phase diagram, as well as quantitative details such as the enhancement of the effective velocity. Our analysis paves the way for an analytic and numerical examination of the stability and competition beyond mean-field theory of the Wigner crystals in this model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Riegler, Jannis Seufert, Ronny Thomale, Peter Wölfle</p>
            <p>We determine the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems in the example of the Hubbard model by calculating the contribution of spin and charge fluctuations to the Gutzwiller approximation mean field result. We employ the slave boson formulation of Kotliar and Ruckenstein in its spin-rotation invariant form in the usual continuous time approximation of the functional integral representation, corrected by "high frequency contributions" (SRIKR+). Previous method-related shortcomings are shown to be overcome when the correct operator ordering for the renormalized kinetic energy is used. The results for the ground state energy in the paramagnetic phase are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art results obtained by methods such as density matrix embedded theory (DMET), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and others. The leading low temperature behavior of the free energy allows to extract the quasiparticle effective mass, in particular its enhancement near a continuous phase transition into an ordered state. Our work demonstrates that the SRIKR+ method is competitive with the best available alternative methods and equips the slave-boson approach with an improved synoptic power to explore strongly correlated electron systems.</p>

            <p>We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</p>

            <p>We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\pi$- and $\phi_0$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.</p>

Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</p>

            <p>We study kagome lattices with on-site and extended spin-singlet s-wave superconducting pairing and show that the inclusion of Rashba spin-orbit (RSO) interaction allows time-reversal-invariant topological superconducting states which support helical Majorana pairs at the edge. We calculate the Z2 topological invariant as a function of the pairing parameters for different chemical potentials. The rich phase diagrams reveal topological, nodal, and trivial superconducting states depending on the system parameters. We also consider a 2X2 time-reversal symmetry-breaking chiral flux phase, which has been demonstrated to be energetically favorable in the AV3Sb5 family of superconductors. Incorporating such symmetry-breaking order in our model leads to chiral Majorana edge states defined by a Chern number. We show how the RSO interaction allows for topological phases with even and odd Chern numbers for different system parameters. This work demonstrates how a simple s-wave kagome superconductor with RSO interaction can support helical and chiral Majorana edge states, and motivates the search for Majorana fermions in kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Manipulating electronic orbital states in quantum materials provides a powerful means to control their physical properties and technological functionality. Here, we demonstrate that orbital populations in strongly correlated oxide thin films can be continuously and reversibly tuned through post-synthesis He ion implantation. Using LaNiO$_3$ as a model system, we show that the orbital preference can be systematically adjusted from favoring in-plane d$_{x^2-y^2}$ occupation toward out-of-plane d$_{z^2}$ states through precise control of ion fluence. X-ray linear dichroism measurements reveal this orbital reconstruction, while density functional theory calculations show the effect stems from ion implantation induced changes in unit cell tetragonality. Unlike conventional heteroepitaxial approaches that lock in orbital configurations during growth, this strain doping technique enables continuous orbital tuning and selective modification of specific film regions after device fabrication. We demonstrate the practical impact of this control by achieving a seven-fold enhancement in oxygen reduction reaction catalysis that can be reversibly tuned through the implantation process. This work establishes ion implantation as a powerful approach for orbital engineering that complements existing synthesis-based strategies while offering unique advantages for both basic research and device development.</p>

            <p>A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural and accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8, for y=0 to y=1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order found in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be tuned cleanly with pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching for films grown of piezoelectric substrates.</p>

            <p>The fundamental thermodynamic bound is derived for the energy cost of inference in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By applying Landauer's principle, we demonstrate that the linear operations in DNNs can, in principle, be performed reversibly, whereas the non-linear activation functions impose an unavoidable energy cost. The resulting theoretical lower bound on the inference energy is determined by the average number of neurons undergoing state transition for each inference. We also restate the thermodynamic bound in terms of negentropy, a metric which is more universal than energy for assessing thermodynamic cost of information processing. Concept of negentropy is further elaborated in the context of information processing in biological and engineered system as well as human intelligence. Our analysis provides insight into the physical limits of DNN efficiency and suggests potential directions for developing energy-efficient AI architectures that leverage reversible analog computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam L.H. Lau, Andreas Gleis, Daniel Kaplan, Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman</p>
            <p>We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial thin-film growth is a versatile and powerful technique for achieving a precise control of composition, stabilizing non-equilibrium phases, tailoring growth orientation, as well as forming heterointerfaces of various quantum materials. For synthesis of highly crystalline thin films, in-depth understanding of epitaxial relationship between the desired thin film and the single-crystalline substrates is necessary. In this study, we investigate epitaxial relationship in thin-film growth of triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CrSe on the (001) plane of Al2O3 and the lattice-matched (111) plane of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates. Structural characterization using out-of-plane and in-plane x-ray diffraction shows that the presence of 19.1o-twisted domains of CrSe significantly dominates the aligned domain on the Al2O3 substrate while it reveals a single-domain formation on the YSZ substrate. The stability of the 19.1o-twisted domain rather than the aligned domain can be explained by rotational commensurate epitaxy, which is well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The single-domain CrSe thin film on the YSZ substrate exhibits a superior metallic conductivity compared to the twisted-domain thin film on the Al2O3 substrate, implying contribution of the grain boundary scattering mechanism to electrical transport.</p>

            <p>Surface structure affects the growth, shape and properties of nanoparticles. In wet chemical syntheses, metal additives and surfactants are used to modify surfaces and guide nanocrystal growth. To understand this process, it is critical to understand how the surface structure is modified. However, measuring the type and arrangement of atoms at hard-soft interfaces on nanoscale surfaces, especially in the presence of surfactants, is extremely challenging. Here, we determine the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface in a metallic nanoparticle by developing low-dose imaging conditions in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy that are preferentially sensitive to surface adatoms. By revealing experimentally the copper additives and bromide surfactant counterion at the surface of a gold nanocuboid and quantifying their interatomic distances, our direct, low-dose imaging method provides atomic-level understanding of chemically sophisticated nanomaterial surface structures. These measurements of the atomic structure of the hard-soft interface provide the information necessary to understand and quantify surface chemistries and energies and their pivotal role in nanocrystal growth.</p>

            <h2>Magnetotransport evidence of a potential low-lying Dirac node in NbAl$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Kit Tsui, Chia-Nung Kuo, Makoto Shimizu, Yajian Hu, Youichi Yanase, Chin Shan Lue, Wei Zhang, Swee K. Goh</p>
            <p>NbAl$_3$ is a novel semimetal with a type-II Dirac node ~230 meV above the Fermi energy. We have performed both out-of-plane ($B\parallel c$) and in-plane magnetotransport measurements ($B\perp c$) on single-crystalline NbAl$_3$. In our out-of-plane data, we observe an interesting linear component in the transverse magnetoresistance, and the mobility spectrum analysis of the out-of-plane data reveals an emergence of high-mobility electrons at low temperatures. Near $B\parallel c$, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are discerned in the magnetoresistance. The oscillation frequencies agree with the density functional theory calculation, the same theory that shows that the Dirac node is far above the Fermi energy. Therefore, the out-of-plane results cannot be attributed to the type-II Dirac node but suggest NbAl$_3$ has additional Dirac or Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. To support this, we examine the in-plane data obtained with the magnetic field perpendicular to the tilting direction of the type-II Dirac cone. Such field direction excludes the possibility of chiral anomaly from the predicted type-II Dirac node. Remarkably, we observe the planar Hall effect, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. These in-plane results are a strong indication of chiral anomaly unrelated to the previously established type-II Dirac node, pointing to the presence of additional Dirac or Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our new density functional theory calculation reveals a type-I Dirac node ~50 meV below the Fermi energy that has previously been overlooked. We argue that the exotic transport phenomena observed in NbAl$_3$ can be attributed to the newly identified type-I Dirac node.</p>

            <h2>Non-linear vortex dynamics in the mixed state of superconducting a-MoGe and NbN thin films using low-frequency two-coil mutual inductance technique</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Somak Basistha, Soumyajit Mandal, John Jesudasan, Vivas Bagwe, Pratap Raychaudhuri</p>
            <p>We use a two-coil mutual inductance technique to investigate the non-linear response of the vortex lattice of two type-II superconducting thin films, namely a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe) and a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN). We observe a strong dependence of the magnetic shielding response of the superconductors on the ac excitation amplitude in the primary coil of the two-coil setup. The sample response is studied through the evolution of the radial profile of the induced current density with increasing drive amplitude, which gets significantly modified by the effect of flux creep. We develop a computation scheme where we iteratively combine the coupled Maxwell-London equations for the geometry of the two coils and the sample involved, with a model developed by Coffey and Clem, to analyze the non-linear ac response. The central result of this analysis is that the effect of flux creep gives rise to a strong nonlinearity in the electrodynamic response in the vortex state of the superconducting thin films, that extends down to very low amplitudes of ac excitation. Our results also show that at subcritical low frequency ac drives, the vortex viscosity is exponentially larger than the Bardeen-Stephen estimate. We present a simple scheme to obtain the intrinsic value of the pinning force constant, which otherwise gets affected due to flux creep even at very low ac drives and point out some outstanding issues that need to be addressed in future theoretical and experimental studies.</p>

            <h2>Rotation-mediated bosonic Josephson junctions in position and momentum spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunayana Dutta, Ofir E. Alon</p>
            <p>In ultracold atoms, bosons tunneling in a double-well potential can produce a typical Josephson junction in real space. A major advancement in quantum matter and simulations is anticipated by the recently found momentum-space Josephson junction effect, which elucidates the supercurrent flow between spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at two distinct independent momentum states. For the first time, our study unveils specific protocols to engineer momentum-space Josephson dynamics for scalar bosons (or a single-component condensate) in a rotating frame through modulation of the geometry of a double-well trapping potential and rotation frequencies. In this setup, rotation simultaneously results in effective double wells both in position and in momentum spaces, and the dynamics of the corresponding Josephson junctions is hosted in these double wells. Consequently, it is observed that the rotation generates momentum-space Josephson dynamics of the condensate along the transverse direction and position-space Josephson dynamics along the longitudinal direction; these effects are particularly noticeable for high rotation frequencies. Additionally, the rotation-induced momentum-space effects are highly significant in both the mean-field and many-body dynamics. Our protocols offer a framework for investigating momentum-space Josephson effects for single-component condensate in both theoretical and experimental contexts, as well as their significant applications in quantum mechanical devices.</p>

            <p>The Brownian motion in water-ethanol mixtures exhibits abnormally large displacements. Using falling-ball viscometry applied to colloidal particles, we experimentally verified that no anomaly exists in the viscosity coefficient of the solution. Our findings reveal that the anomalous Brownian motion can be attributed to the memory effect arising from the coupling between rotational and translational motion. It was deduced that the relaxation time of sub-microsecond rotational motion serves as a memory effect, influencing translational motion and leading to anomalously large Brownian displacements over a timescale of seconds. This study demonstrates that short-time memory effects can be effectively investigated through long-duration measurements.</p>

            <p>We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) method, to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response in realistic Kitaev materials. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid(KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe the experimental observations well, and hence the candidate state be realized in the Kitaev material, {\alpha}-RuCl3. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show the theoretical polarangle dependence of fermionic gap that can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiment.</p>

            <h2>Formulation of spin Nernst effect for spin-nonconserving insulating magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinnosuke Koyama, Joji Nasu</p>
            <p>The spin Nernst effect, an antisymmetric response of a spin current to a temperature gradient, has attracted attention as spin transport phenomenon arising from the topologically nontrivial band structure of carriers. This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.</p>

            <p>Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic frustrated spin chain systems display exotic ground states with unconventional excitations and distinct quantum phase transitions as the ratio of next-nearest-neighbor to nearest-neighbor coupling is tuned. We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamics properties of the spin-1/2 compound, Cu(Ampy)ClBr (Ampy= C6H8N2 = 2-(Aminomethyl)pyridine) via x-ray diffraction, magnetization, specific heat, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (muSR) techniques. The crystal structure features an anisotropic triangular chain lattice of magnetic Cu2+ ions. Our bulk and local probe experiments detect neither long-range magnetic ordering nor spin freezing down to 0.06 K despite the presence of moderate antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ spins as reflected by a Curie-Weiss temperature of about -9 K from the bulk susceptibility data. A broad maximum is observed at about 9 K in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data, indicating the onset of short-range spin correlations. At low temperatures, the zero-field magnetic specific heat and the 1H NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follow an exponential temperature dependence, indicating the presence of gapped magnetic excitations. Furthermore, persistent spin dynamics down to 0.088 K observed by zero-field muSR evidences lack of any static magnetism. We attribute these experimental results to the stabilization of a dimer-singlet phase in the presence of a next-near neighbor interaction and of a randomness in the exchange coupling driven by Cl/Br mixing.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical response theory of interacting Majorana fermions and its application to generic Kitaev quantum spin liquids in a field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Rao, Roderich Moessner, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Motivated by the appearance of Majorana fermions in a broad range of correlated and topological electronic systems, we develop a general method to compute the dynamical response of interacting Majorana fermions in the random-phase approximation (RPA). This can be applied self-consistently on top of Majorana mean-field theory (MFT) backgrounds, thereby in particular providing a powerful tool to analyse $\textit{generic}$ behaviour in the vicinity of (various heavily studied) exactly soluble models. Prime examples are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with emergent Majorana excitations, with the celebrated exact solution of Kitaev. We employ the RPA to study in considerable detail phase structure and dynamics of the extended Kitaev honeycomb $KJ\Gamma$-model, with and without an applied field. First, we benchmark our method with Kitaev's exactly soluble model, finding a remarkable agreement. The interactions between Majorana fermions even turn out to mimic the effect of local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations, which we explain analytically. Second, we show how small non-Kitaev couplings $J$ and $\Gamma$ induce Majorana bound states, resulting in sharp features in the dynamical structure factor in the presence of fractionalisation: such 'spinon excitons' naturally appear, and can coexist and interact with the broad Majorana continuum. Third, for increasing couplings or field, our theory predicts instabilities of the KQSL triggered by the condensation of the sharp modes. From the high symmetry momenta of the condensation we can deduce which magnetically ordered phases surround the KQSL, in good agreement with previous finite-size numerics. We discuss implications for experiments and the broad range of applicability of our method to other QSL and Majorana systems.</p>

            <p>In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for non-Hermitian approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses driven by complex frequency excitations. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are sensitive to the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work paves the way for a rigorous understanding of non-Hermitian physics in quantum systems and their experimental verification through complex frequency-domain techniques.</p>

It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional materials is of great significance and has become an emerging topic. The ferromagnetic VS$_2$ and VSe$_2$ monolayers have been experimentally synthesized, and O element belongs to the same group as S and Se elements. Thus, whether there exists the ferromagnetic VO$_2$ monolayer is a necessary and urgent question. Using first-principles methods within the framework of density functional theory, we predict two kinds of VO$_2$ monolayers with the hexagonal and tetragonal phases and investigate their structural stability, electronic and magnetic properties, and ferromagnetic phase transition. The computational results demonstrate that the two two-dimensional structural phases are stable and possess the ferromagnetic ground states, and they are half-metal with large energy gap. In addition, by solving the Heisenberg model with the Monte Carlo simulation methods, the ferromagnetic phase transition at 270 K in the hexagonal phase is determined. These findings not only predict a new type of intrinsic half-metallic ferromagnet with a high Curie temperature but also fill in an important gap that are lacking in the series of studies from VO$_2$, VS$_2$, VSe$_2$, to VTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Bulk n-type SrTiO3 (STO) has long been known to possess a superconducting ground state at an exceptionally dilute carrier density. This has raised questions about the applicability of the BCS-Eliashberg paradigm with its underlying adiabatic assumption. However, recent experimental reports have set the pairing gap to the critical temperature (Tc) ratio at the BCS value for superconductivity in Nb-doped STO, even though the adiabaticity condition the BCS pairing requires is satisfied over the entire superconducting dome only by the lowest branch of optical phonons. In spite of the strong implications these reports have on specifying the pairing glue, they have not proved sufficient in explaining the magnitude of the optimal doping. This motivated us to apply density functional theory to Nb-doped STO to analyze how the phonon band structures and the electron-phonon coupling evolve with doping. To describe the very low doping concentration, we tuned the homogeneous background charge, from which we obtained a first-principles result on the doping-dependent phonon frequency that is in good agreement with experimental data for Nb-doped STO. Using the EPW code, we obtain the doping-dependent phonon dispersion and the electron-phonon coupling strength. Within the framework of our calculation, we found that the electron-phonon coupling forms a dome in a doping range lower than the experimentally observed superconducting dome of the Nb-doped STO. Additionally, we examined the doping dependence of both the orbital angular momentum quenching in the electron-phonon coupling and the phonon displacement correlation length and found the former to have a strong correlation with our electron-phonon coupling in the overdoped region.</p>

            <p>Topotactic reduction of perovskite oxides offers a powerful approach for discovering novel phenomena, such as superconducting infinite-layer nickelates and polar metallicity, and is commonly accompanied by the emergence of multiple valence states and/or complex crystal fields of transition metals. However, understanding the complex interplay between crystal chemistry, electronic structure, and physical properties at the spin- and orbital-resolved levels in these reduced systems remains elusive. Here, we combine x-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), and density functional theory calculations to uncover topotactic metal-insulator transition and orbital-specific crystal field excitations in brownmillerite La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 thin films. We reveal the Mn valence states to be predominantly Mn2+/Mn3+, along with their corresponding populations at octahedral and tetrahedral sites, which effectively weaken the Mn-O hybridization compared to the parent perovskite phase. As a result, La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 films exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state. Moreover, by combining the RIXS measurements on selected single-valence manganites, specifically MnO, LaMnO3, and CaMnO3, with orbital- and spin-resolved density-of-states calculations, we identify the dd excitations of octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+/Mn3+ ions, directly linking the microscopic electronic structure to the macroscopic magnetic/electrical properties.</p>

            <p>The recent availability of step-edge, frit-disc crucible sets (generally sold as Canfield Crucible Sets or CCS) has led to multiple innovations associated with our group's use of solution growth. Use of CCS allows for the clean separation of liquid from solid phases during the growth process. This clean separation enables the reuse of the decanted liquid, either allowing for simple, economic, savings associated with recycling expensive precursor elements or allowing for the fractionation of a growth into multiple, small steps, revealing the progression of multiple solidifications. Clean separation of liquid from solid phases also allows for the determination of the liquidus line (or surface) and the creation, or correction, of composition-temperature phase diagrams. The reuse of clean decanted liquid has also allowed us to prepare liquids ideally suited for the growth of large single crystals of specific phases by tuning the composition of the melt to the optimal composition for growth of the desired phase, often with reduced nucleation sites. Finally, we discuss how solution growth and CCS use can be harnessed to provide a plethora of composition-temperature data points defining liquidus lines or surfaces with differing degrees of precision to either test or anchor artificial intelligence and/or machine learning based attempts to augment and extend the limited experimentally determined data base.</p>

            <p>The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electron states is an essential ingredient for topological and quantum geometric quantities in solids. For example, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta are a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as circular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by proxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and momentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit angle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as evidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD originates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic contributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken inversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly examine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe of intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical topological insulator $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of incident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the surface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in virtually all bulk bands. Since OAM is forbidden by inversion symmetry in the bulk, we conclude this originates from symmetry-breaking in the photoemission process. Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and suggests that $\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each unit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including inter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the rapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.</p>

BCDI revealed pronounced strain distributions, characterized by a clear layered stripe domain structure in real-space. Stripes were seen only along the [001] crystallographic direction, normal to the substrate surface direction, breaking the symmetry of the cubic high-temperature phase. It is argued that other domain directions were suppressed by the sample mounting orientation. More surprisingly, only a single domain orientation was observed, suggesting an additional symmetry-breaking influence originating from the shape of the crystal.</p>

However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.</p>

            <p>Deep neural quantum states have recently achieved remarkable performance in solving challenging quantum many-body problems. While transformer networks appear particularly promising due to their success in computer science, we show that previously reported transformer wave functions haven't so far been capable to utilize their full power. Here, we introduce the convolutional transformer wave function (CTWF). We show that our CTWFs exhibit superior performance in ground-state search and non-equilibrium dynamics compared to previous results, demonstrating promising capacity in complex quantum problems.</p>

            <h2>Siamese Foundation Models for Crystal Structure Prediction</h2>

            <p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and $\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our approach for advancing materials science research and development.</p>

            <p>Driven systems are of fundamental scientific interest, as they can exhibit properties that are radically different from the same system at equilibrium. In certain cases, long-lived states of driven matter can emerge, which exhibit new material properties. In this work, we probe the excitation spectrum of an emergent patterned state in a driven superfluid, finding that its response is identical to that of a one-dimensional supersolid. In order to extract physical quantities that parametrize the observed sound modes, we apply an effective hydrodynamic theory of superfluid smectics, which is agnostic to microscopic processes. We therefore use the conceptual framework of supersolids to characterize an otherwise dynamic and far-from-equilibrium state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael O. Atambo, Korir Kiptiemoi</p>
            <p>The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.</p>

            <p>We develop a multiscale approach to magnetoelectric effects, bridging atomistic and continuum models, with all parameters determined from ab initio electronic structure calculations. We show that the parameters of the model are equivalent to the electric field-induced Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interactions. After careful validation, we apply the models to study electric polarization and dipole moments carried by spin spirals and topological solitons, in the form of magnetic domain walls and Skyrmions, in the prototypical 2D magnet CrI$_3$. We show that the reduced symmetry of the material leads to additional magnetoelectric coupling terms, dominating over those expected in high symmetry (cubic) materials. An interesting consequence is that Skyrmions carry an out-of-plane electric dipole moment, while that of anti-Skyrmions is an order of magnitude larger and in-plane. Finally, we discuss the possibility to stabilize non-collinear spin states using electric fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Q. Guan, D. Blume, R. J. Lewis-Swan</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the spin-mixing dynamics of a spinor BEC subject to a time-dependent confining potential. Our study provides a theory framework for the experimental results reported in Phys. Rev. A 109, 043309 (2024). We exploit the disparity of energy scales associated with the spatial and internal (spin) degrees of freedom under typical experimental conditions to develop an effective few-mode description of the spin dynamics. Our model demonstrates how the details of the potential, such as driving frequency and amplitude, can be used to independently control spin-changing and spin-preserving collision processes as well as the effective Zeeman energy of the internal states. We obtain the dynamical phase diagram of the effective model and discuss how its structure is altered relative to a spinor BEC with frozen spatial degrees of freedom. The applicability of our effective model is verified through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations that capture the interplay of spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and we identify parameter regimes that can be feasibly explored by future experiments. Our findings highlight the utility of dynamical confining potentials for the control of non-equilibrium spin-mixing dynamics in spinor BECs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brune Massoulié, Clément Erignoux, Cristina Toninelli, Werner Krauth</p>
            <p>We discuss non-reversible Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms that, for particle systems, rigorously sample the positional Boltzmann distribution and that have faster than physical dynamics. These algorithms all feature a non-thermal velocity distribution. They are exemplified by the lifted TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process), a one-dimensional lattice reduction of event-chain Monte Carlo. We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing time scale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive time scale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks. We discuss velocity trapping beyond the case of one-dimensional lattice models and in more than one physical dimensions. Possible applications beyond physics are pointed out.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steve M. Young, Mitchell Brickson, Jason R. Petta, N. Tobias Jacobson</p>
            <p>In the "flopping-mode" regime of electron spin resonance, a single electron confined in a double quantum dot is electrically driven in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. The increased dipole moment of the charge in the flopping mode significantly reduces the amount of power required to drive spin rotations. However, the susceptibility of flopping-mode spin qubits to charge noise, and consequently their overall performance, has not been examined in detail. In this work, we simulate single-qubit gate fidelities of electrically driven spin rotations in an ensemble of devices configured to operate in both the single-dot and flopping-mode regimes. Our model accounts for the valley physics of conduction band electrons in silicon and realistic alloy disorder in the SiGe barrier layers, allowing us to investigate device-to-device variability. We include charge and magnetic noise, as well as spin relaxation processes arising from charge noise and electron-phonon coupling. We find that the two operating modes exhibit significantly different susceptibilities to the various noise sources, with valley splitting and spin relaxation times also playing a role in their relative performance. For realistic noise strengths, we find that single-dot gate fidelities are limited by magnetic noise while flopping-mode fidelities are primarily limited by charge noise and spin relaxation. For sufficiently long spin relaxation times, flopping-mode spin operation is feasible with orders-of-magnitude lower drive power and gate fidelities that are on par with conventional single-dot electric dipole spin resonance.</p>

            <p>The rapid evolution of quantum computing hardware opens up new avenues in the simulation of energy materials. Today's quantum annealers are able to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems. A formidable challenge of this type is posed by materials with site-occupational disorder for which atomic arrangements with a low, or lowest, energy must be found. In this article, a method is presented for the identification of the correlated ground-state distribution of both lithium ions and redox electrons in lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a widely employed cathode material in lithium-ion batteries. The point-charge Coulomb energy model employed correctly reproduces the LFP charging characteristics. As is shown, grand-canonical transformation of the energy cost function makes the combinatorial distribution problem solvable on quantum annealing (QA) hardware. The QA output statistics follow a pseudo-thermal behavior characterized by a problem-dependent effective sampling temperature, which has bearings on the estimated scaling of the QA performance with system size. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computation for the joint optimization of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom in energy materials.</p>

Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</p>

            <p>Emergent electromagnetic induction (EEMI) induced through current-driven spin dynamics was recently predicted and subsequently observed in helical spin magnets, opening a new direction in spintronics and paving the way towards further miniaturization of electronic circuit elements. In contrast to conventional inductors consisting of coil-like structures whose inductance $L$ shows a linear dependence on the cross-section $A$, emergent inductors exhibit an inverse ($\propto {A}^{-1}$) proportionality, favorable for the miniaturization of electrical devices. However, the expected current-linear response of the EEMI voltage has not been demonstrated. Magnetic skyrmions hold promise as a simple platform to study the conceptual foundations of EEMI from current-driven spin dynamics. We fabricated devices of thin film bilayers of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic SrIrO$_3$, which are known to host interfacial Néel skyrmions detected by the appearance of a topological Hall-effect (THE). A large, positive and current-linear inductive response is found to accompany the THE. In our experiment, the current-induced dynamics of pinned magnetic skyrmions creates a voltage both parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric current flow, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse induction, respectively. This is the first report of transverse EEMI, indicating an angle of $80^{\circ}$ between skyrmion motion and the applied current. Our observation of current-linear longitudinal and transverse EEMI is a hallmark of pinned dynamics of magnetic skyrmion textures in oxide heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay P. Nagrani, Akshay J. Thomas, Amy M. Marconnet, Ivan C. Christov</p>
            <p>Rheologically complex soft solids such as thermal greases consist of filler particles within a polymer matrix. These materials find applications in improving the conformity of solid-solid contacts and enhancing heat transfer. Complex soft solids exhibit a transient non-Newtonian rheological response, including thixotropy and viscoelasticity. Previously, stress relaxation and buildup in sheared commercial thermal greases were successfully captured using a nonlinear elasto-visco-plastic (NEVP) model and a thixo-elasto-visco-plastic (TEVP). However, the previous model calibration methods ignored parameter uncertainty, providing only single values of the rheological parameters, and did not quantitatively address the chosen model's identifiability from the data or credibility of the calibration. We address these limitations via hierarchical Bayesian inference, accounting for uncertainties arising from epistemic and aleatoric sources. Importantly, the hierarchical approach allows us to assimilate experiments measuring the stress responses at various startup shear rates by allowing the models' parameters to vary across different shear rates. Then, a global distribution and the associated uncertainty are obtained by pooling. We also propagate uncertainties to the transient shear stress response predicted by the models. Overall, we demonstrate that the chosen NEVP and NEVP models are identifiable from rheometric startup data. However, for the TEVP model, the uncertainty of the parameters is lower (narrower distributions) when higher shear rates are used for inference.</p>

            <h2>Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juven Wang</p>
            <p>Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry. Including $\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather than a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative global anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ that are enhanced from the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ discreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the family number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap preserving the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios canceling $({\bf B} \pm {\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped topological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions) or gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the $N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ representation from the faithful ${\bf B} + {\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the faithful ${\bf Q} + N_c {\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry extension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.</p>

            <p>The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</p>

We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Liénard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.</p>

            <p>The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.</p>

The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction for a layer of templated merocyanine molecules in a planar microcavity. Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction.</p>

            <p>Quantitative analysis of visual arts has recently expanded to encompass a more extensive array of artworks due to the availability of large-scale digitized art collections. Consistent with formal analyses by art historians, many of these studies highlight the significance of encoding spatial structures within artworks to enhance our understanding of visual arts. However, defining universally applicable, interpretable, and sufficiently simple units that capture the essence of paintings and their artistic styles remains challenging. Here we examine ordering patterns in pixel intensities within two-by-two partitions of images from nearly 140,000 paintings created over the past thousand years. These patterns, categorized into eleven types based on arguments of continuity and symmetry, are both universally applicable and detailed enough to correlate with low-level visual features of paintings. We uncover a universal distribution of these patterns, with consistent prevalence within groups, yet modulated across groups by a nontrivial interplay between pattern smoothness and the likelihood of identical pixel intensities. This finding provides a standardized metric for comparing paintings and styles, further establishing a scale to measure deviations from the average prevalence. Our research also shows that these simple patterns carry valuable information for identifying painting styles, though styles generally exhibit considerable variability in the prevalence of ordinal patterns. Moreover, shifts in the prevalence of these patterns reveal a trend in which artworks increasingly diverge from the average incidence over time; however, this evolution is neither smooth nor uniform, with substantial variability in pattern prevalence, particularly after the 1930s.</p>

Therefore, developing scalable synthetic techniques for large-scale and reproducible quality TE materials is critical for advancing TE technology.

Microwave-assisted thermolysis process, providing energy-efficient volumetric heating, was used for the synthesis of bismuth and antimony telluride (Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3). As-made materials were characterized using various techniques, including XRPD, SEM, TEM, XAS, and XPS. Detailed investigation of the local atomic structure of the synthesized Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 powder samples was conducted through synchrotron radiation XAS experiments. The sintered TE materials exhibited low thermal conductivity, achieving the highest TE figure-of-merit values of 0.7 (573 K) and 0.9 (523 K) for n-type Bi2Te3 and p-type Sb2Te3, respectively, shifted significantly to the high-temperature region when compared to earlier reports, highlighting their potential for power generation applications. The scalable, energyand time-efficient synthetic method developed, along with the demonstration of its potential for TE materials, opens the door for a wider application of these materials with minimal environmental impact.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ofri Adiv, Bernd Krauskopf, Scott Parkins</p>
            <p>We study the nonlinear, semiclassical dynamics of an open spin-1 (three-level) variant of the traditional Dicke model. In particular, we focus on V-type energy-level configurations with varying degrees of energy-level asymmetry. We also allow for unbalanced coupling -- where co-rotating and counter-rotating Hamiltonian terms are independently tunable. We characterise the system with a dynamical systems approach, where different behaviors map to definite dynamical objects, and phase transitions to bifurcations. We find the emergence of both periodic and two-frequency oscillations, as well as multistability and chaotic dynamics.</p>

            <p>We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</p>

            <h2>Capturing an Electron in the Virtual State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alok Nath Singh, Bibek Bhandari, Rafael Sánchez, Andrew N. Jordan</p>
            <p>We address a foundational question in quantum mechanics: can a particle be directly found in a classically forbidden virtual state? We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.</p>

            <p>Flow birefringence measurement is an emerging technique for visualizing stress fields in fluid flows. This study investigates flow birefringence in the steady radial Hele-Shaw flow of a shear-thinning fluid. In this flow configuration, stress is dominant along the optical axis, challenging the applicability of the conventional stress-optic law (SOL). We conduct flow birefringence measurements at various flow rates and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The observed phase retardation cannot be quantitatively explained using the conventional SOL, but is successfully described using the second-order SOL, which accounts for stress along the optical direction, using the results of rheo-optical measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the shear-thinning effects on phase retardation from two perspectives: (i) stress changes resulting from viscosity variations and (ii) the variation of the shear-dependent stress-optic coefficient in the second-order SOL. Our findings indicate that the latter is more significant and shear-thinning behavior suppresses radial variations in phase retardation. This study demonstrates that the combination of the second-order SOL and rheo-optical measurements is essential for an accurate interpretation of flow birefringence in Hele-Shaw flow, providing a noninvasive approach for stress field analysis in high-aspect-ratio geometries.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical framework to understand the persistence and coexistence of competitive species in a spatially explicit metacommunity model with a heterogeneous dispersal kernel. Our analysis, based on methods from the physics of disordered systems and non-Gaussian dynamical mean field theory, reveals that species coexistence is governed by a single key parameter, which we term competitive balance. From competitive balance, we derive a novel metric to quantitatively assess the vulnerability of a species, showing that abundance alone is not sufficient to determine it. Rather, a species' vulnerability crucially depends on the state of the metacommunity as a whole. We test our theory by analyzing two distinct tropical forest datasets, finding excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. A key step in our analysis is the introduction of a new quantity - the competitive score - which disentangles the abundance distribution and enables us to circumvent the challenge of estimating both the colonization kernel and the joint abundance distribution. Our findings provide novel and fundamental insights into the ecosystem-level trade-offs underlying macroecological patterns and introduce a robust approach for estimating extinction risks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadia Bihari Padhan, Rahul Pandit</p>
            <p>The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a powerful framework for the study of the statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics of multiphase fluids. We provide an introduction to the equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of systems in which coexisting phases, distinguished from each other by scalar order parameters, are separated by an interface. We then introduce the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) PDEs for two immiscible fluids and generalisations for (a) coexisting phases with different viscosities, (b) CHNS with gravity, (c) the three-component fluids (CHNS3), and (d) the CHNS for active fluids. We discuss mathematical issues of the regularity of solutions of the CHNS PDEs. Finally we provide a survey of the rich variety of results that have been obtained by numerical studies of CHNS-type PDEs for diverse systems, including bubbles in turbulent flows, antibubbles, droplet and liquid-lens mergers, turbulence in the active-CHNS model, and its generalisation that can lead to a self-propelled droplet.</p>

Rams, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Massimo Chiappini, Luke S. Theogarajan, Tathagata Srimani, Giovanni Finocchio, Masoud Mohseni, Kerem Y. Camsari</p>
            <p>Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers [\href{this https URL}{King et al., Nature (2023)}] in solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results challenge the notion of a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hansveer Singh, Romain Vasseur, Andrew C. Potter, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>We consider learnability transitions in monitored quantum systems that undergo noisy evolution, subject to a global strong symmetry -- i.e., in addition to the measuring apparatus, the system can interact with an unobserved environment, but does not exchange charge with it. As in the pure-state setting, we find two information-theoretic phases -- a sharp (fuzzy) phase in which an eavesdropper can rapidly (slowly) learn the symmetry charge. However, because the dynamics is noisy, both phases can be simulated efficiently using tensor networks. Indeed, even when the true dynamics is unitary, introducing noise by hand allows an eavesdropper to efficiently learn the symmetry charge from local measurements, as we demonstrate. We identify the fuzzy phase in this setting as a mixed-state phase that exhibits spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition takes place between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</p>

            <p>We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's subspace. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we identify the requirements that local operations must satisfy to ensure that the eternal black hole states remain static in AdS/CFT.</p>

            <h2>Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M): How to Find Flat Minima in Neural Architecture Search</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Gambella, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri</p>
            <p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become an essential tool for designing effective and efficient neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning.

            <p>While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</p>

            <p>Nanoporous capsules have been the subject of intense investigation in the field of drug delivery. One of the essential properties of such particles, which requires characterization, is their structure. Many experimental techniques have been used for this purpose, such as wide-angle neutron or X-ray scattering, or light scattering. Herein, we report theoretical data on the relationship between the size, porosity and drag force of porous particles. Data were obtained from a numerical procedure based on the lattice Boltzmann method for the calculation of the creeping flow over porous spherical objects. Previous analytical solutions to the hydrodynamic equations yielded different predictions for the drag force under conditions of high permeability. In the light of our findings, we compared our data to previous divergent analytical solutions and analyzed experimental results for dynamic and static light scattering of porous membrane vesicles Our findings strongly indicate a potential source of error that has led to inconsistencies in DLS measurements when compared to other techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-Kun Zhao, Li Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</p>

We incorporate the effects of the drive by using the Floquet formalism in the large frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal magneto conductivity, planar Hall conductivity, longitudinal thermo-electric coefficient, and transverse thermo-electric coefficient, using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. We demonstrate the explicit expressions of these transport coefficients in certain limits of the parameters, where it is possible to perform the integrals analytically. We cross-check our analytical approximations by comparing the physical values with the numerical results, obtained directly from the numerical integration of the integrals. The answers obtained show that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals have profound signatures in these transport properties, which can be observed in experiments.</p>

            <p>The phase diagram of ice is complex and contains many phases, but the most common (frozen water at ambient pressure, also known as Ih ice) is a non-polar material despite individual water molecules being polar1,2. Consequently, ice is not piezoelectric and cannot generate electricity under pressure3. On the other hand, the coupling between polarization and strain gradient (flexoelectricity) is universal4, so ice may in theory generate electricity under bending. Here we report the experimental demonstration that ice is flexoelectric, finding a coefficient of 1.14+-0.13 nC/m, comparable to that of ceramics such as SrTiO3, TiO2, or PbZrO3. Additionally, and unexpectedly, the sensitivity of flexoelectric measurements to surface boundary conditions has also revealed a ferroelectric phase transition around ~160K confined in the near-surface region of the ice slabs. The electromechanical properties of ice may find applications for low-cost transducers made in-situ in cold and remote locations. Importantly, there are also consequences for natural phenomena. In particular, we have calculated the flexoelectric charge density generated in ice-graupel collisions, and found it to be comparable to the experimental charge transferred in such events, suggesting a possible participation of ice flexoelectricity in the charging up of thunderstorms.</p>

In this work, we present a comprehensive examination of shift current and injection current responsible for the circular photogalvanic effect in CeAlSi using first-principles calculations. Our investigation identifies a significant injection current of 4 mA/V$^2$ over a broad range in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding previously reported findings. In addition, we explored several externally controllable parameters to further enhance the photocurrent. A substantial boost in the injection current is observed when applying uniaxial strain along the $c$-axis of the crystal - a 5% strain results in a remarkable 64% increment. The exceptional photocurrent response in CeAlSi suggests that magnetic non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals may provide promising opportunities for novel photogalvanic applications.</p>

In this paper, we report on experimental separation of heat-related and quench-switching-related resistance signal dynamics induced at room temperature by a single femtosecond-laser-pulse in memory devices made from a metallic antiferromagnetic CuMnAs. We show that the heat-related dynamics, on picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds time scales, can be used as a short-term memory where information about input stimuli, represented by laser-pulses, is stored temporarily. When the quench-switching threshold is reached, information is transferred to the device's variable resistance, serving as a long-term memory, with time components of 10 ms and 10 s.

            <p>Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p>
