            <h2>Electrostatics in semiconducting devices I : The Pure Electrostatics Self Consistent Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal</p>
            <p>In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</p>

            <h2>Photo-assisted shot noise probes multiple charge carriers in quantum Hall edges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kishore Iyer, Flavio Ronetti, Benoît Grémaud, Thierry Martin, Thibaut Jonckheere, Jérôme Rech</p>
            <p>Fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect were first observed via DC shot noise measurements of anyons tunneling at a quantum point contact (QPC). However, in scenarios with simultaneous tunneling of different types of charges at the QPC, the connection between DC shot noise and tunneling charge is less transparent. Photo-assisted shot noise (PASN), induced by periodic AC voltage, offers a promising alternative. Here, we investigate PASN in the hierarchical states of the fractional quantum Hall effect, where different types of charges are expected to tunnel concurrently at QPCs. In the particular case of the fractional quantum Hall state $\nu = 2/3$, our analysis demonstrates that PASN can be employed as a robust tool to detect different tunneling charges, even when the tunneling amplitude of one type is significantly smaller compared to the other. We show that the features predicted by our calculations are still visible for typical values of temperature and frequency achieved in state-of-the-art experiments. Our general formalism can be used to compute PASN for general Abelian quantum Hall systems with multiple edge modes and charge types.</p>

            <h2>$d$-Wave Polarization-Spin Locking in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Nikhil V. Medhekar</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of an uncharted phenomenon, termed $d$-wave polarization-spin locking (PSL), in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets. This phenomenon arises from nontrivial Berry connections, resulting in perpendicular electronic polarizations in the spin-up and spin-down channels. Symmetry-protected $d$-wave PSL occurs exclusively in $d$-wave altermagnets with tetragonal layer groups. To identify 2D altermagnets capable of exhibiting this phenomenon, we propose a symmetry-eigenvalue-based criterion, and a rapid method by observing the spin-momentum locking. Using first-principles calculations, monolayer Cr$_2$X$_2$O (X = Se, Te) characterizes promising candidates for $d$-wave PSL, driven by the unusual charge order in these monolayers. This unique polarization-spin interplay leads to spin-up and spin-down electrons accumulating at orthogonal edges, enabling potential applications as spin filters or splitters in spintronics. Furthermore, $d$-wave PSL introduces an unexpected spin-driven ferroelectricity in conventional antiferromagnets. Such magnetoelectric coupling positions $d$-wave PSL as an ideal platform for fast antiferromagnetic memory devices. Our findings not only expand the landscape of altermagnets, complementing conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, but also highlight tantalizing functionalities in altermagnetic materials, potentially revolutionizing information technology.</p>

            <h2>Multistate Control of Nonlinear Photocurrents in Optoferroelectrics via phase manipulation of light field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Kazempour, Esmaeil Taghizadeh Sisakht, Mahmut Sait Okyay, Xiao Jiang, Shunsuke Sato, Noejung Park</p>
            <p>Ultrafast optical control of ferroelectricity based on short and intense light can be utilized to achieve accurate manipulations of ferroelectric materials, which may pave a basis for future breakthrough in nonvolatile memories. Here, we demonstrate that phase manipulation of electric field in the strong field sub-cycle regime induces a nonlinear injection current, efficiently coupling with the topology of band structure and enabling dynamic reversal of both current and polarization. Our time-dependent first-principles calculations reveal that tuning the phase of linearly or circularly polarized light through time-varying chirp, or constant carrier envelop phases within sub-laser-cycle dynamics effectively breaks the time-reversal symmetry, allowing the control over current and electronic polarization reversal over multi-ferroelectric states. Our time- and momentum-resolved transverse current analysis reveal the significance of Berry curvature higher order poles in the apparent association between the odd (even) orders of Berry curvature multipoles to odd (even) pseudo-harmonics in driving polarization dynamics reversal. We suggest that these phase manipulations of short pulse waveform may lead to unprecedented accurate control of nonlinear photocurrents and polarization states, which facilitate the development of precise ultrafast opto-ferroelectric devices.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Combinatorial Electrocatalyst Discovery with Bayesian Optimization: A Case Study in the Quaternary System Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Thelen, R. Zehl, R. Zerdoumi, J. L. Bürgel, L. Banko, W. Schuhmann, A. Ludwig</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Compositionally complex solid solutions comprising multiple metals offer promising catalytic properties, yet their exploration is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. In this work, we combine combinatorial sputtering of thin-film materials libraries and their high-throughput characterization with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the quaternary composition space Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Using this method, the global activity optimum of pure Ru was identified after covering less than 20% of the complete composition space with six materials libraries. Six additional libraries were fabricated to validate the activity trend. The resulting dataset is used to formulate general guidelines for the efficient composition space exploration using combinatorial synthesis paired with Bayesian optimization.</p>

            <h2>Geometric origin of supercurrents in Berry phase: Formula for computing currents from wavefunctions with correlation and particle number variation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Q. Song, J. D. H. Smith, J. Wang</p>
            <p>The complexity of itinerant and many-body nature in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunctions has traditionally led to the use of coarse-grained order parameters for describing currents in superconductors (SC), rather than directly utilizing wavefunctions. In this work, we introduce a phase-based formula that enables the direct computation of currents from microscopic wavefunctions, accounting for correlation and particle number variations. Interestingly, the formulation draws parallels with insulators, suggesting a unified framework for understanding (intra-band) charge transport across two extremes of conductivity. A group velocity current $J_{band}{\propto}\frac{1}{\hbar}{\partial}_kE(k)$ is derived from Berry phase, independent of wave package dynamics, robust against correlation. Additionally, we identify a correlation-driven contribution, $J_{corr}$, which reveals that the pairing correlations ${\langle}c_kc_{-k}{\rangle}$ among dancing partners provide a current component beyond the velocity operator.</p>

            <h2>Polarization of photoluminescence by optically driven orbital reconstruction in magnetically ordered CrCl3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lanqing Zhou, Marjana Ležaić, Yuriy Mokrousov, Minh N. Bui, Renu Rani, Detlev Grützmacher, Beata E. Kardynał</p>
            <p>In this paper, we show that photoluminescence from CrCl3 bulk crystal exhibits a preferential polarization direction when films are magnetically ordered or strained. We verify the magnetization as responsible for the polarization by measuring the signal as a function of the temperature in Voigt configuration while applying the in-plane magnetic field. We show that phonon coupling contributing to vibronic transitions depolarizes the signal compared with zero phonon lines. We explain the data using DFT calculations, which reveal a magnetization-selective occupation of the low energy d-orbital triplet state of Cr3+ upon photon absorption. In addition, the calculations find that the excitation of one electron results in the excited state acquiring out-of-plane components of spin and very large orbital magnetic moments, in addition to a lattice deformation.</p>

            <h2>Charge-state dependent spin-orbit coupling and quantum phase transitions in Ir-Ru oxides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuldeep Kargeti, Bidyut Mallick, Vladislav Borisov, Sk. Soyeb Ali, Johan Hellsvik, Olle Eriksson, S. K. Panda</p>
            <p>The competition between kinematic, relativistic and Coulombic interactions in iridium-based oxides has spurred intense experimental and theoretical investigations regarding the electronic structure and magnetism. We argue here that the Iridium-Ruthenium triple perovskites, Ba$_3$MRuIrO$_9$ (M = Li, Mg and In), are of particular interest in this regard. We show here, using ab-initio theory, that the nominal charge states of Ir can be tuned from +6 to +4 by choosing non-magnetic 'M' ions as Li (+1), Mg(+2) and In (+3). This variation modulates the influence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which is found here to be negligible in Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$, moderate in Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and determining in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. Our analysis classifies Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ as a band-insulator, Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ as a SOC and correlation driven insulator and Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ as $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ Mott-Hubbard insulator. As reported here, correlated electronic structure theory results in sizeable magnetic moments of both Ru and Ir atoms in these systems and atomistic spin-dynamics simulations capture the experimental Néel temperature for Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ and Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and provide evidence for a phase transition for Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ when T $\to$ 0 K, to a multi-valley magnetic state with strong magnetic frustration. The theory identifies the presence of Kitaev interaction among the iridium atoms in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. The realization of such strong anisotropic interactions helps to stabilize a particularly complex energy landscape of Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$, that opens up for exotic magnetic quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Perfect spin-triplet pairing in two-dimensional Ising superconductors purified by indirect excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanyi Zhang, Yu Li, Ping Cui, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>Much research effort has been devoted to interfacial or two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, but the underlying pairing mechanisms and pairing symmetries are highly controversial in most cases. Here we propose an innovative approach to probe the pairing symmetry of 2D superconductors, based on a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a prototypical 2D Ising superconductor coupled with a 2D hole gas through an insulating spacer. We first show that, by tuning the Coulomb attraction between the superconducting and hole layers, the gap of the corresponding indirect exciton insulators is tuned as well, resulting in contrasting manifestations of the distinct superconducting channels with spin-singlet (s-, extended s-, and d-wave) and spin-triplet (p- and f-wave) pairings. Strikingly, we find that the application of in-plane magnetic fields can suppress all other channels while selecting the spin-triplet p-wave channel to be the pure superconducting state, thus providing an ideal and practical platform for realizing highly desirable topological superconductivity. Such an approach can also be readily extended to other types of superconducting systems, offering unprecedented opportunities to probe the microscopic mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Quantum metric non-linear Hall effect in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin-film EuSn2As2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung-Ju Tien, Hsin Lin, Liang Fu, Tay-Rong Chang</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric structure of electrons introduces fundamental insights into understanding quantum effects in materials. One notable manifestation is the non-linear Hall effect (NLHE), which has drawn considerable interest for its potential to overcome the intrinsic limitations of semiconductor diodes at low input power and high frequency. In this study, we investigate NLHE stemming from the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, specifically the quantum metric, in an antiferromagnetic topological material, EuSn2As2, using density functional theory. Our calculations predict a remarkable NLHE arising from a symmetry-protected, single Type-II surface Dirac cone in the even-numbered-layer two-dimensional slab thin-film, yielding a non-linear Hall conductivity exceeding 20 mA/V2-an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. This single Dirac band dispersion represents the simplest model for generating NLHE, positioning the EuSn2As2 thin-film as a hydrogen atom for NLHE systems. Additionally, we observe NLHE from band-edge states near the Fermi level. Our findings also reveal that 30% phosphorus (P) doping can double the non-linear Hall conductivity. With its substantial and tunable NLHE, EuSn2As2 thin-films present promising applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics and rectification devices.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of High-Temperature Superconducting Ternary Hydrides via Deep Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyang Wang, Chengqian Zhang, Zhenyu Wang, Hanyu Liu, Jian Lv, Han Wang, Weinan E, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>The discovery of novel high-temperature superconductor materials holds transformative potential for a wide array of technological applications. However, the combinatorially vast chemical and configurational search space poses a significant bottleneck for both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this study, we employ the design of high-temperature ternary superhydride superconductors as a representative case to demonstrate how this challenge can be well addressed through a deep-learning-driven theoretical framework. This framework integrates high-throughput crystal structure exploration, physics-informed screening, and accurate prediction of superconducting critical temperatures. Our approach enabled the exploration of approximately 36 million ternary hydride structures across a chemical space of 29 elements, leading to the identification of 144 potential high-Tc superconductors with predicted Tc > 200 K and superior thermodynamic stability at 200 GPa. Among these, 129 compounds spanning 27 novel structural prototypes are reported for the first time, representing a significant expansion of the known structural landscape for hydride superconductors. This work not only greatly expands the known repertoire of high-Tc hydride superconductors but also establishes a scalable and efficient methodology for navigating the complex landscape of multinary hydrides.</p>

            <h2>Spin-charge Kondo effect for a quantum dot with side coupled Majorana zero mode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haojie Shen, Wei Su, Mengnan Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate a minimal system consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a Majorana zero mode and a normal lead. We identify the underlying screening process as a novel spin-charge Kondo effect, where the low-energy spin and charge degrees of freedom of the Majorana zero mode-quantum dot subsystem are fully screened by those in the normal lead, resulting in the formation of a spin-charge singlet. An effective low-energy model is derived, with charge fluctuations appropriately accounted for. This spin-charge Kondo effect is found to be consistent with the spin-dependent Andreev/normal boundary conditions induced by the Majorana zero mode. We demonstrate that the anomalous substructure in the spectrum and thermodynamic properties is closely tied to the proportion of the charge component in the screening cloud. The spin-charge screening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional Kondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the boundary conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of Kondo physics and resolve key debates on quantum dot nanostructures with Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <h2>Localized Radiofrequency Heating for Enhanced Thermoelectric Energy Generation Using Natural Galena Ore</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karthik R, Yiwen Zheng, Rajesh Kumar Sahu, Punathil Raman Sreeram, Soma Banik, Aniruddh Vashisth, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary</p>
            <p>The efficiency of thermoelectric devices can be significantly enhanced by maintaining a stable temperature gradient, which can be achieved through localized heating. Radio waves serve as an ideal heat source for this purpose. In this study, we demonstrate the enhancement of thermoelectric performance in earth-abundant natural ore Galena (PbS) through localized radio frequency (RF) heating. RF heating experiments conducted at frequencies between \SI{35}{MHz} and \SI{45}{MHz} induced substantial localized heating in PbS, generating a temperature gradient of \SI{32}{K}. This resulted in a Seebeck voltage of \SI{-5.8}{mV/K}, approximately 13 times greater than the conventional Seebeck coefficient of PbS (\SI{440}{\micro V/K}). Additionally, a power factor of \SI{151}{mWm^{-1}K^{-2}} and an overall RF to thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 15\% were achieved. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the experimental findings, providing insights into the mechanism of thermal transport and RF-induced heating in PbS. These results highlight the potential of localized RF heating as an effective strategy for enhancing thermoelectric performance, with promising implications for ambient thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.</p>

            <h2>Carrier Emission and Capture Competition mediated A(n)BC Recombination Model in Semiconductors with Multi-Level Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanshan Wang, Menglin Huang, Su-Huai Wei, Xin-Gao Gong, Shiyou Chen</p>
            <p>The ABC model has been widely used to describe the carrier recombination rate, in which the rate of non-radiative recombination assisted by deep-level defects is assumed to depend linearly on excess carrier density $\Delta n$, leading to a constant recombination coefficient A. However, for multi-level defects that are prevalent in semiconductors, we demonstrate here that the rate should depend nonlinearly on $\Delta n$. When $\Delta n$ varies, the carrier capture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in different charge states, which can further change the carrier capture and emission rates of the defects and thus make the recombination rate depend non-linearly on $\Delta n$, leading to an $A(n)$ function. However, in many recent calculation studies on carrier recombination rate of multi-level defects, only carrier capture was considered while carrier emission from defect levels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and misleading linear dependence of the rate on $\Delta n$. For $\text{V}_{\text{Ga}}$-$\text{O}_{\text{N}}$ in GaN and $\text{Pb}_\text{I}$ in CsPbI$_3$, our calculations showed that neglecting the carrier emission can cause the recombination rate underestimation by more than 8 orders of magnitude when $\Delta n$ is $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our findings suggest that the recent studies on carrier recombination assisted by multi-level defects should be revisited with carrier emission considered, and the widely-used $ABC$ model should be reformed into the $A(n)BC$ model.</p>

            <h2>Optimization and Performance Evaluation of Cs2CuBiCl6 Double Perovskite Solar Cell for Lead-Free Photovoltaic Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syeda Anber Urooj Wasti, Sundus Naz, Ammara Sattar, Asad Yaqoob, Ateeq ul Rehman, Fawad Ali, Shahbaz Afzal</p>
            <p>In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs.</p>

            <h2>Critical Dynamics of the Anderson Transition on Small-World Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weitao Chen, Ignacio García-Mata, John Martin, Jiangbin Gong, Bertrand Georgeot, Gabriel Lemarié</p>
            <p>The Anderson transition on random graphs draws interest through its resemblance to the many-body localization (MBL) transition with similarly debated properties. In this Letter, we construct a unitary Anderson model on Small-World graphs to characterize long time and large size wave-packet dynamics across the Anderson transition. We reveal the logarithmically slow non-ergodic dynamics in the critical regime, confirming recent random matrix predictions. Our data clearly indicate two localization times: an average localization time that diverges, while the typical one saturates. In the delocalized regime, the dynamics are initially non-ergodic but cross over to ergodic diffusion at long times and large distances. Finite-time scaling then allows us to characterize the critical dynamical properties: the logarithm of the average localization time diverges algebraically, while the ergodic time diverges exponentially. Our results could be used to clarify the dynamical properties of MBL and could guide future experiments with quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dot-based device for high-performance magnetic microscopy and spin filtering in the Kondo regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Lombardo, Imam Makhfudz, Steffen Schäfer, Roland Hayn</p>
            <p>We propose a nanoscale device consisting of a double quantum dot with a full exchange and pair hopping interaction. In this design, the current can only flow through the upper dot, but is sensitive to the spin state of the lower dot. The system is immersed in a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field, and only the bottom dot feels a substantial magnetic field, while the top dot experiences only a residual one. We show that our device exhibits very interesting magnetic field-dependent transport properties at low temperatures. The Kondo effect partially survives the presence of the magnetic field and allows to obtain conductances that differ by several orders of magnitude for the two spin types across the top dot. Interestingly, as a function of the magnetic field, our two-dot device changes from a spin singlet state to a spin triplet state, in which the amplitudes of the spin-dependent conductances are reversed. Our device is able to discriminate between positive and negative magnetic fields with a high sensitivity and is therefore particularly interesting for imaging the surface of anti-ferromagnetic (AF) insulating materials with alternated surface magnetic field, as well as for spin filtering applications.</p>

Furthermore, we derive the correction to the diffusion coefficient of the tracer due to interactions with other particles, validating our results through numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional topological Weyl-dipole phonon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianhua Wang, Yang Wang, Feng Zhou, Wenhong Wang, Zhenxiang Cheng, Shifeng Qian, Xiaotian Wang, Zhi-Ming Yu</p>
            <p>A pair of Weyl points (WPs) with opposite Chern numbers ${\cal{C}}$ can exhibit an additional higher-order $Z_2$ topological charge, giving rise to the formation of a $Z_2$ Weyl dipole. Owing to the nontrivial topological charge, $Z_2$ Weyl dipoles should also appear in pairs, and the WPs within each $Z_2$ Weyl dipole can not be annihilated when meeting together. As a novel topological state, the topological Weyl-dipole phase (TWDP) has garnered significant attention, yet its realization in crystalline materials remains a challenge. Here, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence of the Weyl-dipole phase in the phonon spectra of the $P6_3$ type Y(OH)$_3$. Particularly, the Weyl dipole in this system is protected by a quantized quadrupole moment, and it distinguished from conventional Weyl dipole, as it comprises an unconventional charge-3 WP with ${\cal{C}}=-3$ and three conventional charge-1 WPs with ${\cal{C}}=1$. Consequently, the Weyl-dipole phase in Y(OH)$_3$ features unique two-dimensional (2D) sextuple-helicoid Fermi-arc states on the top and bottom surfaces, protected by the Chern number, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hinge states that connect the two Weyl dipoles along the side hinges, guaranteed by the quantized quadrupole moment. Our findings not only introduce a novel higher-order topological phase, but also promote Y(OH)$_3$ as a promising platform for exploring multi-dimensional boundaries and the interaction between first-order and second-order topologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum effects in charge control of semiconductor surfaces as elucidated by ab initio calculations a review</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stanisław Krukowski, Pawel Kempisty, Pawel Strak</p>
            <p>Recent progress in the investigations of the charge role in semiconductor surfaces is reviewed. This is based on ab intio investigations. That include elucidation of Coulomb interaction of the separated subsystems, such as slab copies or far distant adsorbate and the slab, the bonding in the bulk and on the surface, standard and resonant. The quantum nature of the bonding leads to emergence of the external surface dipole, which was well recognized prior to these investigations. The role of the external dipole layer in the thermalization of the adsorbate is proposed and formulated. The internal dipole charge well known to exist at the surface were supplemented by new finding including the simulation of these dipole fields within slab model, pinning the Fermi level at the surface and the role of bulk and surface charge. of the bonding states. This could also occur at the activated complex point where the energy of these states could be increased into the vicinity of Fermi level or even higher so that this affects the energy barrier for diffusion. Therefore the explicit incorporation of quantum effects in the charge role in the semiconductor surfaces changes their properties considerably as described in this review.</p>

            <p>Driven systems offer the potential to realize a wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena that are inaccessible in static systems, such as the discrete time crystals. Time rondeau crystals with a partial temporal order have been proposed as a distinctive prethermal phase of matter in systems driven by structured random protocols. Yet, heating is inevitable in closed systems and time rondeau crystals eventually melt. We introduce dissipation to counteract heating and demonstrate stable time rondeau crystals, which persist indefinitely, in a many-body interacting system. A key ingredient is synchronization in the non-interacting limit, which allows for stable time rondeau order without generating excessive heating. The presence of many-body interaction competes with synchronization and a de-synchronization phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength. This transition is well captured via a linear stability analysis of the underlying stochastic processes.</p>

            <h2>High second harmonic generation in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals by doping with optimally oriented chromophores</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Ortega, C.L. Folcia, T. Sierra</p>
            <p>We report on the second harmonic generation performance of a ferroelectric nematic fluid consisting of the prototype ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal, RM734 mixed with the classical chromophore Dispersed-Orange 3 at 5 %wt. The mixture exhibits an interesting mesomorphic behavior with a wide temperature range of the ferroelectric mesophase, high nematic order parameter and ease of alignment in cells. In the study, two fundamental wavelengths (1064 nm and 1574 nm) have been used in order to account for the second harmonic generation performance in transparent and absorbing regimens. The results have been very outstanding and are among the highest for liquid crystals so far. Specifically, second order susceptibility tensor components of up to 25 pmV-1 and 8.5 pmV-1 have been obtained in the absorbing and transparent regimens, respectively. The mixing of chromophores with ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals is then stablished as a promising strategy in the search of high-performance nonlinear-optical mesogens.</p>

            <h2>Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Feng Song, Guang-Ming Zhang</p>
            <p>Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.</p>

            <h2>Investigating the relation between elastic and relaxation properties of dry, frictional granular media during shear deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Rigotti, Véronique Dansereau, Jérôme Weiss</p>
            <p>Using discrete element simulations based on molecular dynamics, we investigate the mechanical behavior of sheared, dry, frictional granular media in the "dense" and "critical" regimes. We find that this behavior is partitioned between transient stages and a final stationary stage. While the later is macroscopically consistent with the predictions of the viscous, $\mu(I)$ rheology, both the macroscopic behavior during the transient stages and the overall microscopic behavior suggest a more complex picture. Indeed, the simulated granular medium exhibits a finite elastic stiffness throughout its entire shear deformation history, although topological rearrangements of the grains at the microscale translate into a partial degradation of this stiffness, which can be interpreted as a form of elastic damage. The relaxation of stresses follows a compressed exponential, also highlighting the role of elastic interactions in the medium, with residual stresses that depend on the level of elastic damage. The established relations between elastic and relaxation properties point to a complex rheology, characterized by a damage-dependent transition between a visco-elasto-plastic and a viscous behavior.</p>

            <h2>Random Transverse Field Effects on Magnetic Noise in Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yufei Pei, Claudio Castelnovo, Roderich Moessner</p>
            <p>Motivated by experimental developments in non-Kramers spin ice materials and the unclear role of disorder therein, we study the impact of random transverse fields on the dynamics of correlated magnetic systems. We model the effect of dilute, randomly placed transverse fields on quantities such as magnetic noise/susceptibility and the diffusivity of topological excitations. We consider a random ferromagnetic Ising chain (RTFIC) as well as three-dimensional spin ice. At low temperatures, both exhibit (sub-)diffusive defect dynamics, i.e., of domain walls and magnetic monopoles, respectively. Introducing sparse transverse fields leads to the emergence of an additional timescale on the order of the single-spin flip time. We develop a Lindbladian framework that combines Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization which allows us to characterize the dynamics and develop an analytical understanding of the phenomenon. This framework can be benchmarked in detail for the RTFIC. Our findings provide insights into the magnetization dynamics of disordered non-Kramers oxides, such as oxygen-diluted Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and offer a framework for interpreting experimental observations in these systems.</p>

            <h2>Interstitials as a key ingredient for P segregation to grain boundaries in polycrystalline $α$-Fe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Reiners-Sakic, Alexander Reichmann, Christoph Dösinger, Lorenz Romaner, David Holec</p>
            <p>The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</p>

            <h2>Status of Iron Based Superconductors: characteristics and relevant properties for applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazumasa Iida</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) on LaFePO in 2006, many types of IBSs have been fabricated. IBSs have usually been compared to cuprates and MgB2, and the methodology of research developed by them have been implemented to IBSs. As a result, many similarities between IBSs and cuprates have been revealed, e.g., the parent compounds being antiferromagnets and grain boundaries being weak-links to some extent. On the other hands, the distinct features of IBSs are highlighted as multiband superconductors (i.e., the 5 bands of Fe 3d orbital crossing Fermi level) and extended s-wave symmetry. Additionally, some of the IBSs are topological superconductors that can be possible platforms for quantum computing. In this paper, an overview of IBS research and development in the last 18 years will be reported, involving characteristics of IBSs as well as strategies of increasing the superconducting transition temperature and critical current density.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Nonlocal Transport from Nonlinear Valley Responses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Cao, Hui Wang, Shen Lai, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang</p>
            <p>We develop a theory for the nonlocal measurement of nonlinear valley Hall effect. Different from the linear case where the direct and the inverse processes are reciprocal, we unveil that the nonlinear inverse valley Hall effect needed to generate nonlocal voltage signal must have a distinct symmetry character and involve distinct mechanisms compared to the nonlinear valley Hall response it probes. Particularly, it must be valley-even, in contrast to both linear and nonlinear valley Hall effects which are valley-odd. Layer groups that permit such nonlocal valley responses are obtained via symmetry analysis, and formulas for the nonlocal signals are derived. In the presence of both linear and nonlinear valley responses, we show that the different responses can be distinguished by their distinct scaling behaviors in the different harmonic components, under a low-frequency ac driving. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict sizable nonlocal transport signals from nonlinear valley responses in bilayer $T_{d}$-WTe$_{2}$. Our work lays a foundation for nonlocal transport studies on the emerging nonlinear valleytronics.</p>

            <p>Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineering non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.</p>

            <p>The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays an antiferromagnetic configuration with ferromagnetism-like properties, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 bilayer. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.</p>

            <p>Nanostructured materials formed via kinetically controlled self-assembly processes gather more interest nowadays. Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized by colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter as they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven network structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena of bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability. In this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain insight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed via solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic setup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The formation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related to fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into the structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our understanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the properties of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2/Cr/Au MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) system after annealing (450oC) in different ambient conditions (forming gas, N2 and O2). Defect properties have been analyzed using an approach combining experimental impedance measurements with physics-based simulations of the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3/HfO2 MOS capacitors. This approach enabled us to detect two defect bands in HfO2 characterized by thermal ionization energies of ~1.1eV (acceptor-like) and ~2eV (donor-like) attributed to a polaronic self-trapping state and an oxygen vacancy in HfO2, respectively. This study demonstrates how thermal treatments affect the energy distributions and densities of the observed defects. The adopted methodology also enabled the extraction of the spatial distribution of defects across the HfO2 thickness and Cr/HfO2 interface. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies close to the Cr/HfO2 interface extracted from experimental and simulated electrical data is confirmed by in-situ XPS analysis which shows how Cr is scavenging oxygen from the HfO2 and creating the donor band confined near the Cr/HfO2 interface. This donor band density is observed to be reduced after annealing as per simulation and unchanged for different annealing conditions. We speculate this may be due to the formation of dense films and polyforms of HfO2 under different ambient as revealed by high-resolution TEM images.</p>

            <p>Although metallic elements favor three-dimensional (3D) geometries due to their isotropic, metallic bonding, experiments have reported metals also with two-dimensional (2D) allotropes, the so-called metallenes. And while bulk metals' electronic and structural properties are well known, the corresponding knowledge for atomically thin metallenes remains scattered. Therefore, in this work, we use density-functional theory to investigate the electronic and structural properties of 45 elemental metals with honeycomb, square, and hexagonal lattices, along with their buckled counterparts, resulting in a comprehensive catalog of 270 metallenes with their properties. We systematically present their structural, energetic, and electronic structure properties and discuss similarities and differences compared to their 3D counterparts. As a result, simple and noble metals exhibit similar characteristics and lack buckled hexagonal lattice. Apart from scattered exceptions, the trends in several properties, such as bond lengths, cohesion energies, and projected densities of states, are governed by coordination numbers and exhibit systematic patterns. This systematic reporting provides a necessary reference for the selection and categorization of metallenes for further experimental efforts to develop them for catalytic, sensing, plasmonic, and nanoelectronics applications.</p>

            <p>Asymmetries and anisotropies are widespread in biological systems, including in the structure and dynamics of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending moduli impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending moduli ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics.</p>

            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (SLAHM), where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

In addition to the usual charge and spin DWs, we also construct the cross DW that captures the cross influences between the two degrees of freedom in the transport dynamics, showing a subtle spin and charge coupling effect. Our analytical expressions of the DWs at different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases essentially establish general relations between the Luttinger parameters and the DWs. We further obtain explicit universal critical scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure the this http URL find that the DWs obtained from the direct numerical simulation of this protocol show qualitatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz results.</p>

            <p>Calculations combining density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for transition metal (TM) oxides and similar compounds usually focus on improving the description of the TM $d$ states. Here, we emphasize the importance of also accounting for corrections of the ligand $p$ states. We demonstrate that focusing exclusively on an improved description of the TM $d$ states results in difficulties to obtain the correct insulating behavior for a variety of materials, and requires to use values for the local interaction parameters that are inconsistent with values obtained using, e.g., the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Importantly, these considerations not only apply to cases where the $p$ states are explicitly included in the DMFT low-energy subspace, but also to cases which only include so-called frontier bands with dominant TM $d$ character. We demonstrate that, to a large part, these inconsistencies arise from the use of local/semi-local DFT as starting point for computing interaction parameters within cRPA, and we show that applying a simple empirical correction to the O $p$ and other low energy states not included in the correlated subspace results in improved values for the interaction parameters that then allow to obtain the correct insulating behavior. For the cases where the ligand states are included in the DMFT subspace, we show that even an approximate but realistic Hartree-Fock-like correction applied to the O $p$ states leads to a correct and, most importantly, also a quantitatively consistent DFT+DMFT description of typical Mott insulators such as LaTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$, or the perovskite rare-earth nickelates, $R$NiO$_3$.</p>

            <p>Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</p>

            <h2>Stabilization of Fermi-liquid behavior by interactions in disordered metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arianna Poli, Simone Fratini, Jennifer Coulter, Andrew J. Millis, Sergio Ciuchi</p>
            <p>We study the interplay of electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering in correlated Fermi liquids by the disordered Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory with an IPT-CPA solver. We find significant violations of Matthiessen's rule (additivity of scattering mechanisms) which we explain in terms of the screening of the disorder potential by interactions, leading to a protection of the electron-electron inelastic scattering rate against disorder. We also show that large disorder can lead to a surprising enhancement of the electron-electron scattering that contrasts with the competition seen in the elastic channel. Our results compare positively with available resistivity data in the disordered Fermi liquid phase of the correlated organic metals $\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$X, and rationalize the strong sample dependence of the $T^2$ coefficients observed in the resistivity of correlated perovskite oxides such as SrVO$_3$.</p>

            <h2>Additional jamming transition in 2D bidisperse granular packings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan C. Petit, Matthias Sperl</p>
            <p>We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. The alignment of these findings with 3D results suggests a general geometric mechanism governing the second jamming transition.</p>

            <h2>Mechanism of Charge Transport in Mixed-Valence 2D Layered Hybrid Bronze Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suchona Akter, Mohammad R. Momeni</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional layered bronze (HB) materials are a new class of mixed-valence hybrid organic-inorganic metal oxides that demonstrate great potential as advanced functional materials for next-generation electronics. Recently, new hybrid vanadium bronze materials, (EV)V8O20 and (MV)V8O20, EV = ethyl viologen and MV = methyl viologen, have been introduced, with EV having ~3 orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than the MV system. Given their identical inorganic V-O layers and similar reduction potentials, the observed large difference in electrical conductivities is puzzling. Here, through accurate first-principles calculations coupled with MACE machine learning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations validated by accurate ab initio MD simulations, we provide mechanistic molecular-level insights into dominant charge transport and electrical conductivity pathways in these materials. Our detailed structural and electronic properties data identifies factors contributing to this significant difference in electrical conductivities of these materials. Our findings in this work offer clues and provide valuable insights into improving the electrical conductivity of hybrid bronze and similar materials in order to guide the design of next-generation materials with enhanced properties for future electronic and thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <h2>Time-dependent global sensitivity analysis of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elia Zonta, Ivana Jovanovic Buha, Michele Spinola, Christoph Weißinger, Hans-Joachim Bungartz, Andreas Jossen</p>
            <p>The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model is arguably the most ubiquitous electrochemical model in lithium-ion battery research. Since it is a highly nonlinear model, its input-output relations are still poorly understood. Researchers therefore often employ sensitivity analyses to elucidate relative parametric importance for certain use cases. However, some methods are ill-suited for the complexity of the model and appropriate methods often face the downside of only being applicable to scalar quantities of interest. We implement a novel framework for global sensitivity analysis of time-dependent model outputs and apply it to a drive cycle simulation. We conduct a full and a subgroup sensitivity analysis to resolve lowly sensitive parameters and explore the model error when unimportant parameters are set to arbitrary values. Our findings suggest that the method identifies insensitive parameters whose variations cause only small deviations in the voltage response of the model. By providing the methodology, we hope research questions related to parametric sensitivity for time-dependent quantities of interest, such as voltage responses, can be addressed more easily and adequately in simulative battery research and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Spin noise reveals spin dynamics and recharging of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals</h2>

            <p>The lead halide perovskite nanocrystals embedded into a glass matrix exhibit strong interaction with light and demonstrate exceptional optical and spin related features along with long-term chemical and physical stability. We apply the spin noise spectroscopy technique which offers a number of specific opportunities to study the spin system of CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals in a fluorophosphate glass matrix. A pronounced spin precession peak with an isotropic $g$-factor absolute value of 2.7 and record dephasing time of T$_{2\text{,e}}$ = 2.7 ns is ascribed to resident electrons in the perovskite nanocrystals. The experimentally observed Faraday rotation noise with no noise of ellipticity is explained by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. Increasing the probe intensity, we went beyond the non-perturbative regime and observed a number of light-induced effects. In particular, the illumination with shorter wavelength light gives rise to a persistent recharging of the quantum dots by holes ($|g|=0.17$ and T$^*_{2\text{,h}}$ = 1.4 ns, T$^*_{1\text{,h}}$ $\geq$ 30 ns), which remains stable over multiple cycles of heating to the room temperature and cooling. In addition, elliptically polarized light induced an "optical" magnetic field on the system due to the AC Stark effect. It is confirmed using a new modification of polarization noise spectroscopy with a small degree of circular polarization of the probe light added with different frequencies.</p>

            <h2>From High-Entropy Alloys to Alloys with High Entropy: A New Paradigm in Materials Science and Engineering for Advancing Sustainable Metallurgy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Manuel Torralba, Alberto Meza, S. Venkatesh Kumaran, Amir Mostafaei, Ahad Mohammadzadehd</p>
            <p>The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has marked a paradigm shift in alloy design, moving away from traditional methods that prioritize a dominant base metal enhanced by minor elements. HEAs instead incorporate multiple alloying elements with no single dominant component, broadening the scope of alloy design. This shift has led to the creation of diverse alloys with high entropy (AHEs) families, including high-entropy steels, superalloys, and intermetallics, each highlighting the need to consider additional factors such as stacking fault energy (SFE), lattice misfit, and anti-phase boundary energy (APBE) due to their significant influence on microstructure and performance. Leveraging multiple elements in alloying opens up promising possibilities for developing new alloys from multi-component scrap and electronic waste, reducing reliance on critical metals and emphasizing the need for advanced data generation techniques. With the vast possibilities offered by these multi-component feedstocks, modelling and Artificial Intelligence based tools are essential to efficiently explore and optimize new alloys, supporting sustainable progress in metallurgy. These advancements call for a reimagined alloy design framework, emphasizing robust data acquisition, alternative design parameters, and advanced computational tools over traditional composition-focused methodologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Saha, Md. Kawsar Alam</p>
            <p>Considerable attention has been directed towards the prognosis of lung diseases primarily due to their high prevalence. Despite advancements in detection technologies, current methods such as computed tomography, chest radiographs, bold proteomic patterns, nuclear magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography still face limitations in detecting diseases related to the lungs. Consequently, there is a need for swift, non-invasive and economically feasible detection methods. Our study explores the interaction between BeS monolayer and breathe biomarkers related to lung disease utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) method. Through comprehensive DFT analysis, including electronic properties analysis, charge transfer evaluations, work function, optical properties assessment and recovery times, the feasibility and efficiency of BeS as a VOC (volatile organic compound) detection are investigated. Findings reveal significant changes in bandgap upon VOC adsorption, with notable alteration in work function for selective compounds. Optical property analyses demonstrate the potential for selective detection of biomarkers within specific wavelength ranges. Moreover, the study evaluates the impact of electric fields and strain on VOC-2D BeS interaction. Furthermore, the desorption of these VOCs from the BeS surface can be achieved through a heating process or under the illumination of UV light. This feature enables the reusability of the 2D material for biosensing applications. These findings highlight the potential of the BeS monolayer as a promising material for the sensitive and selective detection of breath biomarkers related to lung disease.</p>

            <p>Orthorhombic-structured II-IV nitrides provide a promising opportunity to expand the material platform while maintaining compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the traditional III-nitride material system. Among them, MgSiN$_{2}$ stands out due to its close compatibility with GaN and AlN and its theoretically predicted ultrawide direct band gap of 6.28 eV. In this work, the growth of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates was investigated using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD growth conditions were correlated with film quality and crystallinity for samples grown on GaN-on-sapphire substrates. The effects of Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratios and growth pressure at two different temperatures, 745$^{\circ}$C and 850$^{\circ}$C, were studied comprehensively. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging confirmed the formation of high-quality, single-crystal MgSiN$_{2}$ films. Optical band gap extraction from transmittance measurements yielded direct band gap values ranging from 6.13 eV to 6.27 eV for samples grown under various conditions, confirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap, III-nitride-compatible, II-IV-nitride material.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that using h-BN as a substrate for the growth of transition metal dichalcogenides can significantly reduce excitonic linewidths. However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p>

            <h2>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</h2>

            <p>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moiré heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential and large filling factor regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Electronic and Structural Properties of Lanthanide-Doped MoS$_2$: Impact of Ionic Size and Orbital Configuration Mismatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyosik Kang, Raquel Queiroz, Lukas Muechler</p>
            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are crucial for quantum technologies such as quantum simulation, secure quantum communication, and precision measurements. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising SPE candidates due to their atomically thin nature and efficient photon extraction. However, their emission wavelengths limit compatibility with existing telecommunication technologies. Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as \defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital derived emissions in the infrared range. Yet, the feasibility of introducing these dopants remains uncertain due to their large ionic radii of the lanthanides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of lanthanide-doped \defect{MoS}{2} monolayers (Ln=Ce, Er). By evaluating formation energies with up to three adjacent S vacancies, we assess how these vacancies mitigate lattice strain caused by the size mismatch of Ce and Er with Mo. Our results show that while \defect{Ln}{Mo} destabilizes the pristine lattice, S vacancies enhance thermodynamic stability. Charge state analysis indicates that defect states introduced by \defect{Ln}{Mo} localize near the valence band and remain stable across a wide Fermi energy range. Electronic structure analysis shows that Ce$^{4+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ maintain their oxidation states upon electron doping due to additional acceptor states from host-induced dangling bonds. These states arise from an orbital filling mismatch between dopants and Mo. Consequently, \defect{Ce}{Mo} is unlikely to exhibit infrared emissions due to its empty $f$-shell, whereas \defect{Er}{Mo} is expected to emit in the infrared. These findings demonstrate the potential of lanthanide-doped TMDCs as tunable SPEs and provide design strategies for optimizing their optical and electronic properties.</p>

            <p>Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids serve as an important theoretical framework for understanding molecular interactions. Binary LJ fluids, where two distinct species of particles interact based on the LJ potential, exhibit rich phase behavior and provide valuable insights of complex fluid mixtures. Here we report the construction and utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for binary LJ fluids, focusing on their effectiveness in predicting radial distribution functions (RDFs) across a range of conditions. The RDFs of a binary mixture with varying compositions and temperatures are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and validate the AI model. In this AI pipeline, RDFs are discretized in order to reduce the output dimension of the model. This, in turn, improves the efficacy, and reduce the complexity of an AI RDF model. The model is shown to predict RDFs for many unknown mixtures very accurately, especially outside the training temperature range. Our analysis suggests that the particle size ratio has a higher order impact on the microstructure of a binary mixture. We also highlight the areas where the fidelity of the AI model is low when encountering new regimes with different underlying physics.</p>

            <h2>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott semimetal and symmetric pseudogap metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>In this work, we demonstrate that Mott physics in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be conveniently captured using the ancilla theory, originally proposed in the context of high-Tc cuprates [Zhang and Sachdev, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)]. In this framework, the Mott gap emerges as a band gap controlled by a hybridization order parameter $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical and ancilla bands. In TBG, the ancilla formalism allows us to calculate the upper and lower Hubbard bands directly in momentum space, both at and away from the magic angle. Projected to the active bands, we reveal a topological obstruction for $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ around the $\Gamma$ point, leading to a topological Mott semi-metal at $\nu=0$. At fillings $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we obtain symmetric correlated insulators at large $U$, and also transitions to semi-metals at smaller $U$ or larger bandwidth. The new formalism also enables us to study the most intriguing density range, $\nu=-2-x$: we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Our theory works above the ordering temperature of a potential symmetry-breaking order. Alternatively, the symmetric pseudogap metal can survive to the zero-temperature limit when there is a sizable anti-Hund's coupling $J_A$. In our theory, the small Fermi surface of the pseudogap metal is primarily formed by ancilla fermions, which we interpret as composite polarons-consisting of a spin moment on an AA site bound to a hole in the nearest neighbor AA site. Within the active band subspace, the composite polaron at $\mathbf k=0$ is orthogonal to the single-particle state due to their differing angular momenta, and thus has vanishing spectral weight. We suggest that superconductivity emerges from the Cooper pairing of these composite fermions instead of single electrons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</p>

            <p>The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.</p>

            <p>The development of simple, scalable, and cost-effective methods to prepare Van der Waals materials for thermoelectric applications is a timely research field, whose potential and possibilities are still largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to 2.2x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for SnSe2 and up to 3.0x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for WSe2.</p>

The charging energy is extracted with high precision and without any other knowledge, thus making true primary thermometry possible. The experiment also reveals a subtle dependence of the charging energy on phonon temperature below 100 mK likely due to the amorphous AlO$_x$ tunnel junctions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske</p>
            <p>The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.</p>

This question is investigated if the number of degrees of freedom N is large. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, experimental situations are discussed that show a violation of the usual statistical mechanical rules. It is shown that by applying a finite but very small perturbation to such systems, the results of quantum statistical mechanics can indeed be recovered. The form of the perturbation is that of a banded random matrix, which has been used previously to describe strongly chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit.

            <h2>Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Bell, Yan Wang, Kevin C. Smith, Yuan Liu, Eugene Dumitrescu, S. M. Girvin</p>
            <p>We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.</p>

            <h2>Observation of mechanical kink control and generation via phonons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Qian, Nan Cheng, Francesco Serafin, Kai Sun, Georgios Theocharis, Xiaoming Mao, Nicholas Boechler</p>
            <p>Kinks (or domain walls) are localized transitions between distinct ground states associated with a topological invariant, and are central to many phenomena across physics, from condensed matter to cosmology. While phonon (i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to deterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this interaction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable stochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by low-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because all physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making deterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the existence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that constitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our metamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically protected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations that show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal unique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent in other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for topological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Apolinario Miguel Tan, Franco Pellegrini, Stefano de Gironcoli</p>
            <p>We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2,3,4$ trained on pure dimers, or on large datasets of different diversities but without any dimers. Potentials trained on a more diverse dataset fare better in validation and result in a nontrivial dimer curve, but still very far from the theoretical two-body interaction calculated by DFT. Moreover, dimer curves between descriptor sets clipped at different $K$ do not seem to converge to a universal function for a given dataset. We conclude that machine learning potentials employing atomic cluster expansions optimize losses at low $K$ but fail to generalize and converge properties described by two-body interactions.</p>

However, efficiently producing these high-value chemicals via C-C coupling reactions is a significant challenge. This requires catalysts with optimized surface configurations and electronic properties capable of breaking the scaling relations among various intermediates. In this report, we introduce the fundamentals of electrocatalytic CO2RR and the mechanism of C-C coupling. We examine the effects of catalytic surface interactions with key intermediates and reaction pathways, and discuss emerging strategies for enhancing C-C coupling reactions toward C2+ products. Despite varieties of these strategies, we summarize direct clues for the proper design of the catalyst for the electrocatalytic CO2RR towards C2+ products, aiming to provide valuable insights to broad readers in the field.</p>

            <p>In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions.

            <p>Hot electrons generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon (LSP) in metallic nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection, and other optoelectronic devices. Aluminum nanoparticles are promising for hot-carrier devices since aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. However, a comprehensive understanding of hot-carrier generation in practical nanoparticles is still missing. In this study, we present theoretical predictions of hot-carrier generation rates in spherical aluminum nanoparticles with up to 315,75 atoms in different dielectric environments. These predictions are obtained from an approach, which combines a solution of Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding models. By changing the environmental dielectric constants, the LSP frequency can be adjusted over a wide range from deep ultraviolet at 9 eV to the visible spectrum at 2-2.75 eV. Meanwhile, by varying the sizes of nanoparticles, we observed that as the nanoparticle size increases to 10 nm, discrete hot-carrier energy level transitions converge to the continuous energy transitions of bulk metals, and no intraband transitions are observed, unlike in noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Luo, Alexey Snezhko, Petia M. Vlahovska</p>
            <p>Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds numbers, driven by the activity of the microswimmers. In this study, we develop a model system to examine these dynamics using motile colloids that mimic bacterial locomotion. The colloids are powered by the Quincke instability, which causes them to spontaneously roll in a random-walk pattern when exposed to a square-wave electric field. We experimentally investigate the flow dynamics in dense suspensions of these Quincke random walkers under quasi two-dimensional conditions, where the particle size is comparable to the gap between the electrodes. Our results reveal an energy spectrum scaling at high wavenumbers as $ \sim k^{-4}$, which holds across a broad range of activity levels -- controlled by the field strength -- and particle concentrations. We observe that velocity time correlations decay within a single period of the square-wave field, yet an anti-correlation appears between successive field applications, indicative of a dynamic structural memory of the ensemble.</p>

Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have proven to be a robust means to harness quantum sensing for such applications. We have developed an instrument to measure the magnetic stray field of a sample with nanometre resolution from 2 K to 300 K and that accepts samples without additional preparation, especially the need to prepare a microwave line on the sample. The instrument features a software-interface for controlling and synchronising all included optical, mechanical and electronic devices and which analyses the acquired information in real time. We present the key features and measurement results achieved with atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips hosting an NV centre and a fully remote controllable microscope platform. The magnetometer is commercially available, and a first demonstrator has been installed in a research facility. We show micro Tesla per square root Hertz sensitivity, low noise AFM tip control and optically detected resonance scans in a closed-cycle cryostat.</p>

            <h2>A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> François Gay-Balmaz</p>
            <p>Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, leading to the introduction of nonequilibrium stresses arising from both viscous and thermal effects to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.</p>

            <p>For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from $\alpha$-tantalum, avoiding the meta-stable $\beta$-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing $\beta$-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ($Q_\text{i}$) up to $(5.0 \pm 2.5) \times 10^6$ in the single photon regime. They outperform resonators with no sign of the $\beta$-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of $\beta$-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum based superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Chang, Hui Xia</p>
            <p>We investigate numerically the effects of long-range temporal and spatial correlations based on the rescaled distributions of the squared interface width $W^2(L,t)$ and the interface height $h(x,t)$ in the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth system within the early growth regimes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that long-range temporally correlated noise could not significantly impact the distribution form of the interface width. Generally, $W^2(L,t)$ obeys approximately lognormal distribution when the temporal correlation exponent $\theta \ge 0$. On the other hand, the effects of long-range spatially correlated noise are evidently different from the temporally correlated case. Our results show that, when the spatial correlation exponent $\rho \le 0.20$, the distribution forms of $W^2(L,t)$ approach the lognormal distribution, and when $\rho > 0.20$, the distribution becomes more asymmetric, steep, and fat-tailed, and tends to an unknown distribution form. As a comparison, probability distributions of the interface height are also provided in the temporally and spatially correlated KPZ system, exhibiting quite different characteristics from each other within the whole correlated regimes. For the temporal correlation, the height distributions satisfy Tracy-Widom Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (TW-GOE) when $\theta \to 0$, and with increasing $\theta$, the height distributions crossover continously to an unknown distribution. However, for the spatial correlation, the height distributions gradually transition from the TW-GOE distribution to the standard Gaussian form.</p>

Across different temperatures and interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions, quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost values of the neural network, showcasing the network's ability to accelerate Green's function based calculations of correlated materials.</p>

            <p>We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</p>

We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagomé link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a Möbius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the Néel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Under the Möbius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</p>

Using this, we find an excellent collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$ $\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.</p>

            <h2>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath</p>
            <p>We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</p>

            <h2>Higher Landau-Level Analogs and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chong Wang, Xiao-Wei Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Jie Wang, Ting Cao, Di Xiao</p>
            <p>Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moiré superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moiré miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moiré superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitali Telezki, Stefan Klumpp</p>
            <p>Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</p>

            <h2>Orbital magnetization from interface reflections in a conductor with charge current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Voss, I. A. Ado, M. Titov</p>
            <p>We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary can serve as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. When an electric current flows parallel to the interface, the balance between clockwise and counterclockwise reflections is disrupted, leading to a net orbital magnetization. This magnetization is maximized at the interface and varies linearly in the direction perpendicular to it. We suggest that this effect can be detected using spatially resolved Kerr effect measurements at distances up to the electron phase coherence length from the interface. Unlike the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects, the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample and is unrelated to Hall effect physics.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anika Götz, Gabriel Rein, João Carvalho Inácio, Fakher F. Assaad</p>
            <p>We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schläfli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, Karl J Friston</p>
            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miaomiao Zhao, Wei-Wei Yang, Xueming Guo, Hong-Gang Luo, Yin Zhong</p>
            <p>Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).</p>

            <p>Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. We show that this approach can be used to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two parallel 1D Bose gases. This analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system. Our method is general and can be applied to other cold atom systems with spatial phase gradients, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</p>

            <p>We performed high-throughput density functional theory calculations of optical matrix elements between band edges across a diverse set of non-magnetic two-dimensional monolayers with direct band gaps. Materials were ranked as potential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal nitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with optical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane dipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk semiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate interband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established a correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling, linking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified chalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical responses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical radiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that excitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some direct-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states, classifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for tuning excitonic recombination dynamics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.</p>

            <p>Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ has attracted recent interest due to its proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and the complex structural response observed at high pressures. We use x-ray spectroscopy and scattering as well as electrical transport techniques to unveil the electronic structure of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at ambient and high pressures. Despite featuring a $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}}$ $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state at ambient pressure, Ir $L_{3}$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering reveals broadened electronic excitations that point to the importance of Ir $5d$-Cu $3d$ interaction. High pressure first drives an Ir-Ir dimer state with collapsed $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$ and $\langle L_z \rangle/\langle S_z \rangle$, signaling the formation of $5d$ molecular orbitals. A novel $\mathrm{Cu \to Ir}$ charge transfer is observed at the onset of phase 5 above 30 GPa at low temperatures, leading to an approximate $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ valence, with persistent insulating electrical transport seemingly driven by charge segregation of Cu 1+/2+ ions into distinct sites. Concomitant x-ray spectroscopy and scattering measurements through different thermodynamic paths demonstrate a strong electron-lattice coupling, with $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ and $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$/$\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ electronic states occurring only in phases 1 and 5, respectively. Remarkably, the charge-transferred state can only be reached if Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is pressurized at low temperature, suggesting that phonons play an important role in the stability of this phase. These results point to the choice of thermodynamic path across interplanar collapse transition as a key route to access novel states in intercalated iridates.</p>

            <p>We present an approach to approximating static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection (composite) of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO2 as an example, we illustrate and discuss how well various atomic and electronic structure properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce experimental data. The practical benefit of our approach, which can be rigorously thought of as representing an infinitely quickly quenched liquid, is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms while retaining a good overall predictive accuracy. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses and amorphous phases closer to the state of modeling of crystalline solids.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

We use the polarizability and proton 'superconductivity' of water confined in few-molecular-diameters clay channels to build an all-water supercapacitor. The device fabricated from reconstructed clay, graphene, and water by a sustainable self-assembly process, operates at voltages up to 1.65 V, has competitive power and energy density, and maintains near 100% Coulombic efficiency over 60,000 charge-discharge cycles.

            <p>Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Yamase</p>
            <p>We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <p>We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Structures for Crush Energy Absorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirak Kansara, Siamak F. Khosroshahi, Leo Guo, Miguel A. Bessa, Wei Tan</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.</p>

            <h2>Epitaxial PbGeSe thin films and their photoluminescence in the mid-wave infrared</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kelly Xiao, Bryce Wong, Jarod Meyer, Leland Nordin, Kunal Mukherjee</p>
            <p>PbSe is a narrow bandgap IV-VI compound semiconductor with application in mid-wave infrared optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and quantum devices. Alkaline earth or rare earth elements such as Sr and Eu can substitute Pb to widen the bandgap of PbSe in heterostructure devices, but they come with challenges such as deteriorating optical and electronic properties, even in dilute concentrations due to their dissimilar atomic nature. We substitute Pb instead with column-IV Ge and assess the potential of rocksalt phase PbGeSe as a wider bandgap semiconductor in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrates. Low sticking of GeSe adatoms requires synthesis temperatures below 260 °C to incorporate Ge, but this yields poor structural and compositional uniformity as determined by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, as-grown films in the range Pb0.94Ge0.06Se to Pb0.83Ge0.17Se (6-17% Ge) show much less bandgap widening in photoluminescence than prior work on bulk crystals using absorption. We observe that post-growth rapid thermal annealing at temperatures of 375-450 °C improves the crystal quality and recovers bandgap widening. Rapid interdiffusion of Ge during annealing, however, remains a challenge in harnessing such PbGeSe materials for compositionally sharp heterostructures. Annealed 17%-Ge films emit light at 3-3.1 um with minimal shift in wavelength versus temperature. These samples are wider in bandgap than PbSe films by 55 meV at room temperature and the widening increases to 160 meV at 80 K, thanks to sharply different dependence of bandgap on temperature in PbSe and PbGeSe.</p>

            <h2>Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.V. Khomitsky, M.V. Bastrakova, D.S. Pashin</p>
            <p>Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julien Despres</p>
            <p>We extend the quench spectroscopy method to dissipative and isolated non-Hermitian quantum lattice models via the case study of the open Bose-Hubbard chain and the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain respectively. We first investigate theoretically the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase induced by a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions using the equation-of-motion approach. Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed analytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for each case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.</p>

            <h2>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxue Ran, Sylvain Capponi, Junchen Rong, Fabien Alet, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <p>Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</p>

            <p>The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed magnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene are examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a fields-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.</p>

            <p>Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</p>

            <p>Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bahruz Suleymanli, B. Tanatar</p>
            <p>The theory of layered superconductors is extended in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions (SOIs). Using the intralayer BCS-like pairing interaction and employing the Gor'kov formalism, we obtain analytical expressions for the temperature Green's functions and determine the gap function $\Delta$ which becomes complex in the presence of SOIs. In the absence of SOIs, $\Delta$ is isotropic at both zero and finite temperatures, but it becomes anisotropic even in the presence of a single SOI. This anisotropy is related to the extra $\cos{k_z}$ factors in which the $k_z$ momentum along the $z$ direction contributes to the magnitude of the gap function. It is also found that SOIs suppress $\Delta$ at both zero and finite temperatures, and for certain critical values of SOIs and beyond $\Delta$ vanishes. Analytical expressions for the critical values of SOIs at zero temperature are obtained. Additionally, how the BCS equation for layered superconductors changes in the presence of SOIs is determined.</p>

            <p>We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.</p>

            <p>While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable Lévy processes (Lévy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for Lévy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, critical indicators for differentiating these states, such as Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and inverse participation ratios (IPRs), have yet to be experimentally detected. To address these challenges, we introduce exactly solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with flat bands, analytically determining phase boundaries using Avila's global theorem. We propose experimental realizations using Rydberg atom arrays, enabling the distinction of localized, extended, and multifractal states with as few as 18 qubits. Importantly, we develop a robust spectroscopic method for the experimental measurement of LEs and IPRs. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>The shift current photovoltaic effect is conventionally understood as the real-space displacement of a wave packet induced by photoexcitation. However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field.

A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb$_3$X$_8$ (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weican Yang, Xing Wang, Makoto Tsubota</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</p>

            <p>One effective way to prevent toxicity and improve the stability of materials for photovoltaic applications is to exclude lead and organic molecules from perovskite materials. Specifically, the CsSn1-xGexI3 appears to be a promising contender; nonetheless, it requires optimization, particularly bandgap tuning by doping concentration modifications. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to comprehensively analyze the electronic properties of CsSn1-xGexI3 that influenced light-matter interactions tuning of the perovskite materials by varying composition in B site atoms. We use the solar cell capacitance (SCAPS-1D) simulator to compute device performance; however, it computes the absorption spectrum using a simplified mathematical function that approximates the actual spectrum. To achieve a quantum-mechanical level of accuracy DFT extracted parameters like absorption spectra and bandgap were fed into SCAPS-1D. We find that increasing the Ge concentration leads to a higher bandgap and improved absorption profile, thereby enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency. Thermal and field distribution analyses were also done for the optimized device through a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. By optimizing the absorber layer with a 75% Ge concentration, we achieve a remarkable PCE of 23.80%. Our findings guide future research in designing high-performance non-leaded halide PSCs, paving the way for low-cost, stable, and highly efficient solar cells through atomic doping-tuned perovskite absorber layers.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has garnered significant attention for its promising application in high density nonvolatile data storage and nanoscale transistors. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. The ongoing debate centers on whether HfO$_2$ is a proper or improper ferroelectric, as it exhibits characteristics of both types. In this study, we utilize symmetry-guided first-principles quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations to accurately map the energy landscape and identify the coherent switching pathway of HfO$_2$ by voltage. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ is driven by a triggered mechanism through coupling between the stable polar mode and hybrid non-polar modes. Second, unusually high polarization arises from the hybrid modes, which consists solely of non-polar modes. The results fundamentally transforms the perspective on polarization in HfO$_2$ and resolve conflicting characteristics observed, offering valuable guidance for superior technological applications.</p>

By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi J. Zhao, Samuel J. Garratt, Joel E. Moore</p>
            <p>We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</p>

            <h2>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. L. Krapivsky, Baruch Meerson</p>
            <p>We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Nomura, Motoharu Kitatani, Shiro Sakai, Ryotaro Arita</p>
            <p>We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <h2>Local geometry of NAE-SAT solutions in the condensation regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Allan Sly, Youngtak Sohn</p>
            <p>The local behavior of typical solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) describes many important phenomena including clustering thresholds, decay of correlations, and the behavior of message passing algorithms. When the constraint density is low, studying the planted model is a powerful technique for determining this local behavior which in many examples has a simple Markovian structure. The work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, Müller (2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold. Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random CSPs in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) class. Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation $O(n^{-1/2})$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.</p>

We develop a single-parameter scaling theory for the spectral statistics in this scenario, which embodies exact self-similarity of the spectral correlations along the complete scrambling dynamics.

            <h2>Sensitivity of peptide conformational dynamics in carbon nanotubes to directional mechanical forces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe C. Nepomuceno, Michal H. Kolář</p>
            <p>In living organisms, proteins and peptides are often under the influence of mechanical forces, especially in confined spaces such as membrane channels, ribosome exit tunnel, or proteasome gate. Due to the directional nature of proteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence protein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study, we employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in the same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three decapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the difference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is relatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides. The loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide play a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide significantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to the nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through the nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics of the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how short peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment, emphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding these processes.</p>

            <p>Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer Rényi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pratik Nandy, Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka</p>
            <p>Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening a band gap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of topological edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators, as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we experimentally characterize the dispersion of edge states, and we examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience to various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum-locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. Also, we develop a theoretical model based on a Green's function approach that describes the square lattice of resonators and features quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of $\Gamma$ and $M$ high-symmetry points that are removed upon the introduction of bianisotropy, and apply this model to evaluate Berry curvature. The considered design opens possibilities in the construction of optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring topological edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</p>

We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</p>

            <p>Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</p>

            <p>A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses (APs) from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to optimize pulse width effectively. By adjusting the photon energy while maintaining a constant peak electric field, this strategy modulates the peak vector potential and laser field period, thereby controlling the high harmonic cutoff energy and the time-domain emission characteristics of the harmonics. The field-driven electronic dynamics lead to a non-monotonic variation in both the intensity and duration of the generated attosecond pulses. The light field frequency can be adjusted to yield the optimal pulse. Beyond the primary demonstration with hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, significant pulse width optimization has been achieved across a range of different materials. This straightforward and versatile strategy shows promise for application in solid-state materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.</p>

            <p>Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</p>

            <h2>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valery Shchesnovich</p>
            <p>Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</p>

We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satori Tsuzuki</p>
            <p>Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</p>

The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H"). As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</p>

            <p>To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</p>

            <p>Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</p>

            <p>Spintronics is concerned with replacing charge current with current of spin, the electron's intrinsic angular momentum. In magnetic insulators, spin currents are carried by magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations on top of the magnetically ordered state. Magnon spin currents are especially promising for information technology due to their low intrinsic damping, non-reciprocal transport, micrometer wavelengths at microwave frequencies, and strong interactions that enable signal transduction. In this perspective, we give our view on the progress and challenges towards realizing magnon spintronics based on atomically thin Van der Waals magnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials of which the tunability and versatility has attracted a great deal of ongoing research.</p>

            <h2>Spin-chirality driven second-harmonic generation in two-dimensional magnet CrSBr</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dezhao Wu, Yong Xu, Meng Ye, Wenhui Duan</p>
            <p>The interplay between magnetism and light can create abundant optical phenomena. Here, we demonstrated the emergence of an unconventional magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) stemming from vector spin chirality, denoted as chiral SHG. Taking bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr as a prototype, we theoretically showed that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Remarkbly, chiral SHG was found to be proportional to the spin chirality and spin canting-induced electric polarization, while the intrinsic MSHG was proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we revealed a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin canting direction, generating giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a novel SHG with superb tunability but also advances the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raffaele Resta</p>
            <p>The ground-state quantum geometry is at the root of several static and adiabatic properties, while genuinely dynamic properties are routinely addressed via Kubo formulae, whose essential entries are the excited states. It is shown here that the ground-state metric-curvature tensor evolves in time by means of a causal unitary operator, which by construction elucidates the geometrical effect of the excited states in compact form. In the condensed-matter case the generalized tensor encompasses the whole conductivity tensor at arbitrary frequencies in both insulators and metals, with the exception of the Drude term in the metallic case; the latter is shown to be eminently nongeometrical.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Wigner functions and quantum transport in multiband systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Mitscherling, Dan S. Borgnia, SuryaNeil Ahuja, Joel E. Moore, Vir B. Bulchandani</p>
            <p>Traditional theories of electron transport in crystals are based on the Boltzmann equation and do not capture physics arising from quantum coherence. We introduce a transport formalism based on ''orbital Wigner functions'', which accurately captures quantum coherent physics in multiband fermionic systems. We illustrate the power of this approach compared to traditional semiclassical transport theory by testing it numerically against microscopic simulations of one-dimensional, non-interacting, two-band systems -- the simplest systems capable of exhibiting inter-orbital coherence. We show that orbital Wigner functions accurately capture strongly non-equilibrium features of electron dynamics that lie beyond conventional Boltzmann theory, such as the ballistic transport of a relative phase between microscopic orbitals and topological Thouless pumping of charge both at non-zero temperature and away from the adiabatic limit. Our approach is motivated in part by modern ultracold atom experiments that can prepare and measure far-from-equilibrium charge transport and phase coherence in multiband fermionic systems, calling for correspondingly precise theories of transport. The quantitative accuracy exhibited by our approach, together with its capacity to capture nontrivial physics even at the ballistic scale, establishes orbital Wigner functions as an ideal starting point for developing a fully systematic theory of transport in crystals.</p>

            <h2>Projected and Solvable Topological Heavy Fermion Model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyu Hu, Zhi-Da Song, B. Andrei Bernevig</p>
            <p>We investigate the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) in the projected limit, where only the flat bands are present in the low-energy spectrum. Such limit has been previously analyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not in a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of the $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but smaller than the gap ($\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF model, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in momentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized $f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise from $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces power-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of relevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\ll \gamma$ limit. Nonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \gg \Delta(\omega)$ for $|\omega|\lesssim U_1$, where $\Delta(\omega)\sim \gamma^2 N(\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\omega)$ is the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison between $U_1$ and $\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if $N(\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the correlated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and estimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment that, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the single-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the interaction is always larger than the gap.</p>

            <h2>Moiré-Tunable Localization of Simultaneous Type I and Type II Band Alignment in a MoSe2/WS2 Heterobilayer</h2>

            <p>Moiré heterobilayers exhibiting spatially varying band alignment and electron and hole localization that can be precisely controlled through the twist angle have emerged as exciting platforms for studying complex quantum phenomena. While most heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have a type II band alignment, the introduction of type I band alignment could enable stronger light-matter coupling and enhanced radiative emission. Here, we show through a combination of first-principles GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) calculations and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) measurements that contrary to previous understanding, the MoSe2/WS2 heterobilayer has a type I band alignment at large twist angles and simultaneous regions of type I and type II band alignment due to the structural reconstruction in different high symmetry regions at small twist angles. In tr-ARPES, consistent with our calculations, a long-lived electron population is only observed in MoSe2 for samples with large twist angles, while in samples with small twist angles, signals from two distinct long-lived excitons are observed. Moreover, despite the near degeneracy of the conduction bands of the two layers, no excitonic hybridization occurs, suggesting that previously observed absorption peaks in this material arise from lattice reconstruction. Our findings clarify the complex energy landscape in MoSe2/WS2 heterostructures, where the coexistence of type I and type II band alignment opens the door to moiré-tunable optoelectronic devices with intrinsic lateral heterojunctions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the orbital magnetic susceptibility of the tight-binding model for the honeycomb ladder with the additional vertical hopping. Despite being one-dimensional, the magnetic flux penetrating the hexagonal rings affects the energetics of electrons, resulting in the finite orbital magnetic response. We find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility is sensitive to the parameters as well as the chemical potential. At half-filling, the response is diamagnetic when the system is close to the pure honeycomb ladder, whereas it turns to paramagnetic when it is close to the two-leg ladder. We also find several characteristic properties away from half-filling, such as the diamagnetic response at the band top and bottom, and the large paramagnetic response at the band gap sandwiched by the divergent density of states.</p>

            <p>Geometric representation lays the basis for understanding and flexible tuning of topological transitions in many physical systems. An example is given by the Poincaré sphere (PS) that provides an intuitive and continuous parameterization of the spin or orbital angular momentum (OAM) light states. Here, we apply this geometric construction to understand and continuously encode dynamical topologies of ferroelectric solitons driven by OAM-tunable light. We show that: (1) PS engineering enables controlled creation of dynamic polar antiskyrmions that are rarely found in ferroelectrics; (2) We link such topological transition to the tuning of the light beam as a ``knob'' from OAM (PS pole) to non-OAM (PS equator) modes; (3) Intermediate OAM-state structured light results in new ferroelectric topologies of temporally hybrid skyrmion-antiskyrmion states. Our study offers new approaches of robust control and flexible tuning of topologies of matter using structured light.</p>

            <p>The Kondo-lattice model describes a typical spin-charge coupled system in which localized spins and itinerant electrons are strongly coupled via exchange interactions and exhibits a variety of long-wavelength magnetic orders originating from the nesting of Fermi surfaces.

Our recent theoretical studies based on the large-scale spin-dynamics simulations have revealed several interesting nonequilibrium phenomena and excitation dynamics in the Kondo-lattice model, e.g., dynamical magnetic topology switching and peculiar spin-wave modes of the skyrmion crystals and the hedgehog lattices under irradiation with electromagnetic waves such as microwaves and light. These achievements are expected to open a new research field to explore novel nonequilibrium topological phenomena and related material functions of the spin-charge coupled magnets.</p>

            <p>Evidence of superconductivity (SC) has recently been reported in pressurized La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, providing a new platform to explore high-temperature superconductivity. However, while zero resistance state has been observed, experimental characterization of the superconducting properties of pressurized nickelates is still limited and experimentally challenging. Here, we present the first full temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 measurement in La4Ni3O10 single crystal, achieved by combining high magnetic field and high-pressure techniques. Remarkably, the Hc2 of La4Ni3O10 is nearly isotropic, with the anisotropic parameter monotonically increasing from 1.4 near Tc to 1 at lower temperatures. By analyzing the Hc2 using the two-band model, we uncover that the anisotropic diffusivity of the bands, primarily originating from d(z2 ) and d(x2-y2 ) orbitals, is well compensated, resulting in an unusually isotropic superconducting state. These findings provide critical experimental evidence that underscores the significant role of the d(z2 ) orbital in enabling superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</p>

            <p>We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity Favored Anisotropic Phase Stiffness in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</h2>

            <p>In unconventional superconductors such as cuprates and iron pnictides and chalcogenides, phase stiffness - a measure of the energy cost associated with superconducting phase variations - is on the same order of magnitude as the strength of Cooper pairing, translating to superconductivity governed by phase fluctuations. However, due to a lack of a direct experimental probe, there remains a fundamental gap in establishing microscopic picture between unconventional superconductivity and phase fluctuations. Here we show a vector current technique that allows for in-situ angle-resolved transport measurements, providing exclusive evidence suggesting an anisotropic nature of phase stiffness in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. Pronounced anisotropy of in-plane resistance manifests itself in both normal and superconducting transition states, indicating crystal symmetry breaking. Remarkably, the electric conductivity of Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 peaks at 125° between the direction of the current and crystal principal axis, but this angle evolves to 160° near zero-resistance temperature. Further measurements reveal that the superconductivity is favored along a direction with minimized phase fluctuations, an orientation strikingly deviating from the symmetric direction imposed by both electronic anisotropy and the underlying crystal lattice. Identical measurements conducted on a prototypical cuprate superconductor yield consistent results, suggesting that this previously unknown behavior could be ubiquitous. By shielding insight into the contrasting anisotropy between electron fluid and superfluid, our findings provide clues for a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductors</p>

            <h2>Diagnosing Altermagnetic Phases through Quantum Oscillations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Xia Li, Xiangang Wan, Wei Chen</p>
            <p>The recently delimited altermagnetic phase is characterized by zero net magnetization but momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To explore the intriguing physical effects and potential applications of altermagnets, it is essential to analyze their Fermi surface properties, encompassing both configurations and spin textures. Here, we conduct a Fermiology study on metallic altermagnets and demonstrate that the collinear spin-split features of their Fermi surfaces can be clearly revealed through quantum oscillation measurements. By introducing a transverse Zeeman field to remove the spin-degenerate lines in the momentum space, the Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to spin-flipped cyclotron motion between orbits with opposite spins. Accordingly, the Lifshitz-Onsager quantization yields two sets of Landau levels, leading to frequency splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in conductivity. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman field causes two separate cyclotron orbits to merge at the Lifshitz transition point before splitting again. This results in the two original frequencies discontinuously changing into a single frequency equal to their sum. Our work unveils a unique and universal signature of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces that can be probed through quantum oscillation measurements.</p>

Altermagnetic magnon bands can be realized by breaking the symmetry of the second nearest neighbor exchange couplings without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition to the Chern number and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, chirality is important to describe the magnon topology. The model shows the nonzero magnon spin Nernst effect when a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. We calculate the differential gyromagnetic ratio induced purely by the topology of altermagnetic magnons, which can be probed through the Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect.</p>

            <p>Orbital magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the band topology of bulk crystalline insulators. Typical examples include the half quantized Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling in three dimensional (3D) axion insulators and topological insulators, which are the hallmarks of their nontrivial bulk band topology. While the Chern-Simons coupling is well defined only for insulators with zero Chern number, the orbital magnetoelectric effects in 3D Chern insulators with nonzero (layer) Chern numbers are still open questions. In this work, we propose a never-mentioned quantization rule for the orbital magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators, the spatial gradient of which is exactly quantized in unit of $e^2/h$. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that such quantized orbital magnetoelectric response is exact for various types of interlayer hoppings and stackings, and remains robust even against disorder and lack of crystalline symmetries. We argue that the exact quantization has a topological origin and is protected by Chern number. Furthermore, we propose two promising material platforms to observe the proposed quantized orbital magnetoelectric response thanks to recent experimental developments in detecting spatial magnetic-field distributions in device systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Francini, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>The candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits a characteristic ferrimagnetic response at low temperatures, with a finite residual magnetization that changes sign at a compensation point located at around half the ordering temperature. We argue that the behavior can be naturally understood to arise in this material as a consequence of a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic ground state. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the finite-temperature response of the pertinent honeycomb Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model in weak training fields. Our model features all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, as well as sublattice-dependent next-nearest-neighbor interactions, consistent with the reported crystal structure of the material. We also consider a six-spin ring exchange perturbation, which allows us to tune between the two different magnetic long-range orders that have been suggested for this material in the literature, namely, a collinear single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag state and a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ state. We demonstrate that the experimentally-observed ferrimagnetic response of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ can be well described within our modeling if the magnetic ground state features noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order. The observation of a compensation point, where the residual magnetization reverses sign, suggests a sublattice $g$-factor anisotropy, with a larger out-of-plane $g$-factor on the sublattice with stronger antiferromagnetic intrasublattice exchange. By contrast, a classical Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$-type model with collinear zigzag ground state is insufficient even in principle to describe the observed behavior. Our results illustrate the unconventional physics of noncollinear magnetic long-range orders hosted by frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions.</p>

The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical study of the collective excitations of the supersolid annular stripe phase of a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled (SOAM-coupled) spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The annular stripe phase simultaneously breaks two continuous symmetries, namely rotational and $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and is more probable in the condensates with a larger orbital angular momentum transfer imparted by a pair of Laguerre-Gaussian beams than what has been considered in the recent experiments. Accordingly, we consider a SOAM-coupled spin-1 condensate with a $4\hbar$ orbital angular momentum transferred by the lasers. Depending on the values of the Raman coupling strength and quadratic Zeeman term, the condensate with realistic antiferromagnetic interactions supports three ground-state phases: the annular stripe, the vortex necklace, and the zero angular momentum phase. We numerically calculate the collective excitations of the condensate as a function of coupling and quadratic Zeeman field strengths for a fixed ratio of spin-dependent and spin-independent interaction strengths. At low Raman coupling strengths, we observe a direct transition from the zero angular momentum to the annular stripe phase, characterized by the softening of a double symmetric roton mode, which serves as a precursor to supersolidity.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the fingering instability that forms during stretching of capillary suspensions with and without added nanoparticles. The dewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched under constant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recorded using two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites and the intersecting number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingering instability. The addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles. The addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network. Incorporation of nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and enhances fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary suspensions' overall microstructure more homogeneous, reduce the sample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledge has potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-film coatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.</p>

            <p>We investigate the universality of an Ising symmetry breaking phase transition of tilted two-dimensional Dirac fermions, in the type-I phase as well as at the Lifshitz transition between a type-I and a type-II semimetal, where the Fermi surface changes from point-like to one with electron and hole pockets that touch at the overtilted Dirac cones. We compute the Landau damping of long-wavelength order parameter fluctuations by tilted Dirac fermions and use the resulting IR propagator as input for a renormalisation-group analysis of the resulting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. We first demonstrate that the criticality of tilted type-I fermions is controlled by a line of fixed points along which the poles of the renormalised Green function correspond to an untilted Dirac spectrum with varying anisotropy of Fermi velocities. At the phase transition the Lorentz invariance is restored, resulting in the same critical exponents as for conventional Dirac systems. The multicritical point is given by the endpoint of the fixed-point line. It can be approached along any path in parameter space that avoids the fixed point line of the critical type-I semimetal. We show that the critical exponents at the Lifshitz point are different and that Lorentz invariance is broken.</p>

            <h2>Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet-triplet superconductor junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.</p>

            <h2>Undamped Soliton-like Domain Wall Motion in Sliding Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubai Shi, Yuxiang Gao, Ri He, Hua Wang, Binwen Zhang, Zhicheng Zhong</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer van der Waals materials exhibits ultrafast switching speed and fatigue resistance during the polarization switching, offering an avenue for the design of memories and neuromorphic devices. The unique polarization switching behavior originates from the distinct characteristics of domain wall (DW), which possesses broader width and faster motion compared to conventional ferroelectrics. Herein, using machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations and field theory analysis, we predict an undamped soliton-like DW motion in sliding ferroelectrics. It is found that the DW in sliding ferroelectric bilayer 3R-MoS2 exhibits uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, with its velocity ultimately reaches the relativistic-like limit due to continuous acceleration. Remarkably, the DW velocity remains constant even after the external field removal, completely deviating from the velocity breakdown observed in conventional ferroelectrics. This work provides opportunities for applications of sliding ferroelectrics in memory devices based on DW engineering.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone, Giovanni A. Ummarino, Alessandro Braggio, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</p>

            <p>Kagome systems have garnered considerable attention due to the unique features of the sublattice structure and band topology. The recently discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A = K, Rb, Cs) host a rich array of symmetry-breaking phases, including exotic charge density waves (CDW), electronic nematicity, pair density waves (PDW) and superconductivity. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the diverse phases, several key issues remain contentious, such as a solid clarification of the time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRS-breaking) in the CDW order and its implications for the nature of superconducting (SC) pairing symmetry. This review aims to shed light on the transport properties of these intertwined phases, emphasizing the pivotal role that transport measurements play in uncovering the non-trivial quantum states of matter.</p>

As resource estimates we indicate the total number of gates $N$ and simulation time $T$, expressed in terms of the number $n$ of spin 1/2 lattice sites (qubits), target accuracy $\epsilon$, and simulated time $t$. We provide circuit constructions that realize the simulation time $T^{(1)}\propto nt^2/\epsilon$ and $T^{(2q)}\propto t^{1+\eta}n^\eta/\epsilon^\eta$ for arbitrarily small $\eta=1/2q$ for the first-order and higher-order Trotter expansions.

            <p>Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta>\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenbo Sun, Adrian E. Rubio López, Zubin Jacob</p>
            <p>Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</p>

            <h2>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiro Shimoda, Tomoki Wada</p>
            <p>Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches $\sim200$~EeV known as Amaterasu CR. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of $\sim1$~ZeV ion within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of $\sim$~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim10$~PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</p>

            <h2>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghoon Kim, Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>We introduce evolved quantum Boltzmann machines as a variational ansatz for quantum optimization and learning tasks. Given two parameterized Hamiltonians $G(\theta)$ and $H(\phi)$, an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine consists of preparing a thermal state of the first Hamiltonian $G(\theta)$ followed by unitary evolution according to the second Hamiltonian $H(\phi)$. Alternatively, one can think of it as first realizing imaginary time evolution according to $G(\theta)$ followed by real time evolution according to $H(\phi)$. After defining this ansatz, we provide analytical expressions for the gradient vector and illustrate their application in ground-state energy estimation and generative modeling, showing how the gradient for these tasks can be estimated by means of quantum algorithms that involve classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. We also establish analytical expressions for the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrix elements of evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, as well as quantum algorithms for estimating each of them, which leads to at least three different general natural gradient descent algorithms based on this ansatz. Along the way, we establish a broad generalization of the main result of [Luo, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 132, 885 (2004)], proving that the Fisher-Bures and Wigner-Yanase information matrices of general parameterized families of states differ by no more than a factor of two in the matrix (Loewner) order, making them essentially interchangeable for training when using natural gradient descent.</p>

            <p>Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce entanglement when applied to a part of the resource state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result contributes to mitigating noise in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.</p>

            <h2>Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xilin Feng, Zi-Ting Sun, K.T.Law</p>
            <p>Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, both $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ QAH states have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism, driven by the interplay between trigonal warping and staggered layer order under an applied displacement field. Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands into a central touching point and three "leg" Dirac cones. In the presence of staggered layer order, this splitting enables mass inversions driven by the displacement field to occur asynchronously at the central touching point and the "leg" Dirac cones, potentially leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal multilayer graphene systems, predicting the existence of additional QAH states beyond $C = \pm N, \pm 2N$ for $N$-layer graphene.</p>

            <p>Photocatalytic water splitting represents a pivotal pathway for converting solar energy into chemical energy, with the core challenge lying in the design and optimization of photocatalysts [1] . TiO2, as a quintessential photocatalytic material, undergoes significant alterations in its electronic and crystalline structures under intense light irradiation, which may directly impacts its photocatalytic efficiency [2] . To gain a profound understanding of these transformations, in situ characterization techniques such as X-ray scattering and neutron scattering have emerged as crucial tools. This paper, from a combined perspective of theoretical computation and experimental characterization, explores the differential capabilities of X-ray scattering and neutron scattering in characterizing the pair distribution function (PDF) of materials during photocatalytic water splitting. Furthermore, through simulation calculations, it aims to unveil the changes in the electronic and crystalline structures under intense light irradiation.

To address this problem, we grew epitaxial LaMnO3/KTaO3 heterostructures using molecular beam epitaxy. We show that superconductivity is extremely robust against the in-plane magnetic field. Our results indicate that the interface orientation, despite impacting the critical temperature, does not affect the ratio of critical field to the Pauli limiting field.

            <p>Topological Hall effect (THE), a quantum phenomenon arising from emergent magnetic field generated by topological spin texture, is a key method for detecting non-coplanar spin structures like skyrmions in magnetic materials. Here, we investigate a bilayer structure of Pt and conducting ferrimagnet NiCo2O4 (NCO) of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate giant THE across a temperature range 2 - 350 K. The absence of THE in single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small nucleation centers. This aligns with the unresolvable domain structures during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.</p>

            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant for future low-power electronics devices, where a main challenge is realizing QAHE at high temperatures. In this work, based on experimentally reported two-dimensional (2D) germanene and magnetic semiconductors Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ and Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and the first principle calculations, germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures are investigated. Topologically nontrivial edge states and quantized anomalous Hall conductance are demonstrated. It is shown that the QAHE temperature can be enhanced to approximately 62 K in germanene/monolayer (ML) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 2.1\% tensile strain, 64 K in germanene/bilayer (BL) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.4\% tensile strain, and 50 K in germanene/ML Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.3\% tensile strain. With increasing tensile strain of these heterostructures, the band gap decreases and the Curie temperature rises, and the highest temperature of QAHE is obtained. Since these 2D materials were discovered in recent experiments, our results provide promising materials for achieving high-temperature QAHE.</p>

            <p>Bilayer crystals, built by stacking crystalline monolayers, generate interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by fixed covalent lattices and orientations. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as diverse functional groups enable tunable molecular lattices and interlayer potentials, tailoring a wide range of excitonic properties. Here, we report hybrid excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), directly synthesized with single-crystalline perylene diimide (PDI) molecular crystal atop WS2 monolayers. These excitons arise from a hybridized bilayer band structure, revealed by lattice-scale first-principles calculations, inheriting properties from both monolayers. They exhibit bright photoluminescence with near-unity polarization above and below the WS2 bandgap, along with spectral signatures of exciton delocalization, supported by theory, while their energies and intensities are tuned by modifying the HBC composition by synthesis.

Our results show that the trilayer topological insulator exhibits two-dimensional Weyl semimetal characteristics with helical edge states. Notably, the Weyl points are located at four high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, and the topology of symmetric subspaces governs the formation of these Weyl points and edge states. Upon introducing a d-wave altermagnet oriented along the z-direction, gaps open in the helical edge states while preserving two Weyl points, leading to the realization of two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals hosting topological corner states. The nonzero winding number in the subspace along the high-symmetry line serves as a topological invariant characterizing these corner states, and the other subspace Hamiltonian confirms the existence of the Weyl points. Finally, a topological phase diagram provides a complete topological description of the system.</p>

The system's topological properties are characterized by the spin Chern number. We present the topological phase diagram of the bilayer honeycomb lattice, providing a detailed insight into the stability and tunability of the quantum spin Hall effect in this system. The presence of helical edge states is confirmed by the measurement of quantized longitudinal resistance values of 3/2(h/e2) and 1/2(h/e2) in a sixterminal Hall-bar device. Remarkably, this quantum spin Hall insulator phase is protected by interlayer parity-time (PT) symmetry, despite the breaking of time-reversal symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander S. Minkin, Irina V. Lebedeva, Andrey M. Popov, Sergey A. Vyrko, Nikolai A. Poklonski, Yurii E. Lozovik</p>
            <p>The effect of structure relaxation on the potential energy surface (PES) of interlayer interaction of twisted graphene bilayer is studied for a set of commensurate moiré systems using the registry-dependent empirical potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. It is found that the influence of structure relaxation on the amplitude of PES corrugations (determining static friction) depends on the unit cell size (or related twist angle) of the moiré system. For moiré systems with the smallest unit cells, the amplitudes of PES corrugations calculated with and without account of structure relaxation are approximately the same. However, for large unit cell sizes, the structure relaxation can lead to an increase of PES corrugations by orders of magnitude. This means that structure relaxation can provide the main contribution into the static friction of a superlubric system under certain conditions (such as the contact size and twist angle). Moreover, the change of the PES type because of structure relaxation from a trigonal lattice of maxima to a trigonal lattice of minima is observed for the systems with the moiré patterns (5,1) and (5,3). Based on the results obtained, possible crossovers between static friction modes taking place upon changing the twist angle in a macroscopic superlubric system consisting of identical layers are discussed. Additionally it is shown that the PES for relaxed structures can still be approximated by the first Fourier harmonics compatible with symmetries of twisted layers analogously to the PES for rigid layers.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial superconductivity and a Se-vacancy ordered insulating phase in the FeSe/PbOx heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunkai Guo, Xuanyu Long, Jingming Yan, Zheng Liu, Qi-Kun Xue, Wei Li</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3 has sparked significant interests in exploring new superconducting systems with engineered interfaces. Here, using molecular beam epitaxy growth, we successfully fabricate FeSe/PbOx heterostructures and discover superconductivities in three different monolayer FeSe-related interfaces. We observe superconducting gaps of 13~14 meV in the monolayer FeSe films grown on two different phases of PbOx. Moreover, we discover a new insulating Fe10Se9 phase with an ordered $\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ Se-vacancy structure. Our first-principles calculation suggests that this new insulating phase originates from electronic correlation. Intriguingly, an additional monolayer FeSe film grown on the insulating Fe10Se9 also exhibits superconductivity with the gap size of 5 meV. Our results suggest that the work function differences between the monolayer FeSe and the substrates, which can induce band bending and charge transfer, are crucial for the interfacial superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonanc in bilayer nickelate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Borchia, Hannah Lange, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anjishnu Bose, Samuel Vadnais, Arun Paramekanti</p>
            <p>Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. We study the mean field phase diagram of these multiorbital models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering two types of ALM order: (i) itinerant weak-coupling ALM metals driven by quasi-1D van Hove singularities, as well as (ii) strong ALM order at half-filling. We also find regimes of superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d_{xy}$-wave pair density wave order, and uniform phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and ALM order. Our inhomogeneous mean field theory approach reveals that the coexistence phases are unstable to phase separation, but longer-range interactions could lead to stripe order. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetizing the FeSe-like two-dimensional materials and approaching to giant tunneling magnetoresistance with Janus Cr4BN(B2) MBene electrode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiwei Sun, Mingzhuang Wang, Baisheng Sa, Shaui Dong, Carmine Autieri</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 Åvaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiuyue Ma, Busheng Wang, Guochun Yang, Yong Liu</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has emerged as a third fundamental category of collinear magnetism, characterized by spin-splitting in symmetry-compensated collinear antiferromagnets, opening new frontiers in spintronics and condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a novel altermagnetic semiconductor, the asymmetric Janus V$_2$AsBrO monolayer, which exhibits a magnetic easy axis favoring the out-of-plane direction and a Néel temperature ($T_N$) exceeding room temperature. The system exhibits a strain-tunable piezovalley effect, generating valley polarization under uniaxial strain. Notably, hole doping under uniaxial strain generates a net magnetization ($M$) through a piezomagnetic mechanism. Additionally, the broken inversion symmetry endows the monolayer with a substantial out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31}$ (2.19 pm/V), presenting broad prospects for the development and design of novel piezoelectric devices. Our findings provide a promising candidate material for the advancement of 2D multifunctional devices in nanoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, and piezoelectrics.</p>

            <h2>Fortuity in SYK Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Ming Chang, Yiming Chen, Bik Soon Sia, Zhenbin Yang</p>
            <p>We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes. We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</p>

            <p>We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kaplan, Kevin P. Lucht, Pavel A. Volkov, J.H. Pixley</p>
            <p>Nonlinear optical response is a sensitive probe of the geometry and symmetry of electronic Bloch states in solids. Here, we extend this notion to the Bogoliubiov-de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles in superconductors. We present a theory of photocurrents in superconductors and show that they sensitively depend on the quantum geometry of the BdG excitation spectrum. For all light polarizations, the photocurrent is proportional to the quantum geometric tensor: for linear polarized light it is related to the quantum metric and for circular polarization -- the Berry curvature dipole of the associated BdG bands. We further relate the photocurrent to the ground state symmetries, providing a symmetry dictionary for the allowed photocurrent responses. For light not at normal incidence to the sample, photocurrent probes time-reversal symmetry breaking in systems with chiral point groups (such as twisted bilayers). We demonstrate that photocurrents allow to probe topology and TRS breaking in twisted $d$-wave superconductors and test the nature of superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ and multilayer stacks of rhombohedral graphene. Our results pave the way to contactless measurement of the quantum geometric properties and symmetry of superconductivity in materials and heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.</p>

            <p>We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</p>

            <p>The shift current is a non-linear photocurrent generally associated with the underlying quantum geometry. However, a topological origin for the shift photocurrent in non-centrosymmetric systems has recently been proposed. The corresponding topological classification goes beyond the ten-fold paradigm and is associated with the presence of a reverting Thouless pump (RTP). In this work we examine an antiferromagnetic monolayer within the family of MXenes, Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$. This material is centrosymmetric, however, magnetic ordering violates inversion symmetry. We demonstrate evidence of an RTP in each spin-sector which has been perturbed, destroying quantization of the invariant. Nevertheless, a giant spin-resolved shift current persists. We further investigate the mid-gap edge states and classification of the system as a fragile topological insulator to which trivial bands have been coupled.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Costa, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerging at the interfaces of superconducting magnetic tunnel junctions is at the heart of multiple unprecedented physical phenomena, covering triplet proximity effects induced by unconventional (spin-flip) Andreev reflections, giant transport magnetoanisotropies, sizable tunneling anomalous Hall effects, and electrically controlled current-reversing $ 0 $--$ \pi $(-like) transitions in Josephson contacts. Recent first-principles calculations proposed that the Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide and van der Waals multilayers can -- owing to broken mirror symmetries -- exhibit an unconventional radial component (with spin parallel to the electron's momentum), which can be quantified by the Rashba angle $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $. We theoretically explore the ramifications of radial Rashba SOC at the interfaces of vertical ferromagnet/superconductor tunnel junctions with a focus on the magnetoanisotropies of the tunneling and tunneling-anomalous-Hall-effect conductances. Our results demonstrate that $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $ can be experimentally extracted from respective magnetization-angle shifts, providing a robust way to probe the radial Rashba SOC induced by twisted multilayers that are placed as tunneling barriers between ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes.</p>

            <p>We investigate turbulence in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a box potential using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Turbulence is driven by an oscillating force, causing the components to oscillate either in-phase (co-oscillating) or out-of-phase (counter-oscillating). A parameter measuring component separation (0 for overlap, 1 for full separation) reveals two turbulent states: coupled (the parameter $\sim0$) and decoupled (the parameter $\sim0.5$). Co-oscillating flows transition between these states at a critical interaction strength, while counter-oscillating flows consistently show the decoupled state. A probabilistic model predicts the decoupled state's parameter as $\sqrt{4/\pi - 1} = 0.523$, consistent with simulations.</p>

            <p>We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhimeng Hao, Taifeng Liu</p>
            <p>Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4 BVO) is a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion, but its efficiency is limited by small polaron formation. However, some physical properties of BVO deviate from typical small polaron behavior. Using the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that BVO forms a quasi-large hole polaron with a radius around 2 nm, resembling free carriers with high mobility. This polaron is stabilized primarily by acoustic phonon modes, creating a shallow trap state near the valence band maximum, which prolongs its lifetime. Simultaneously, it retains a redox potential comparable to that of free carriers. We propose that such large polarons explain the superior properties of BVO and other transition metal oxide photocatalysts. Tuning phonon modes to stabilize large polarons offers a promising strategy for designing materials with enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency.</p>

            <p>Nickel ditelluride (NiTe2) is a newly identified Type-II Dirac semimetal, showing novel characteristics in electronic transport and optical experiments. In this study, we explored the nonlinear optical properties of two-dimensional NiTe2 using experimental and computational techniques (density functional theory-based approach). Few layered two-dimensional NiTe2 (2D-NiTe2) are synthesized using liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), which is characterized using X-ray diffraction technique, transmission electron, and atomic force microscopy. The nonlinear refractive index and third-order nonlinear susceptibility of the prepared 2D-NiTe2 are determined from the self-induced diffraction pattern generated using different wavelengths ( 405, 532, and 650 nm) in the far field. In addition, the diffraction pattern generated by spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) is further verified by varying concentration (2D-NiTe2 in the IPA solvent), wavelength (of incoming laser beams), and cuvette width (active path length). The high value of third-order nonlinear susceptibility (in order of 10-9 e.s.u.) determined using SSPM in the 2D-NiTe2 can be attributed to the laser-induced hole coherence effect. Lastly, utilizing the reverse saturable absorption property of 2D-hBN, asymmetric light propagation is also demonstrated in the 2D-NiTe2/2D-hBN heterostructure.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of pristine and doped C$_4$N$_2$ nanosheets as potential electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The pristine C$_{36}$N$_{18}$ nanosheets exhibit limited HER activity, primarily due to high positive Gibbs free energies ($>$ 2.2 eV). To enhance catalytic performance, doping with B, Si, or P at the nitrogen site was explored. Among these systems, B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets exhibit the most promising catalytic activity, with a Gibbs free energy close to zero ($\approx$ -0.2 eV), indicating efficient hydrogen adsorption. Band structure, projected density of states, charge density, and Bader charge analyses reveal significant changes in the electronic environment due to doping. While stacking configurations (AA$'$A$''$ and ABC) have minimal effect on catalytic performance, doping - particularly with B -substantially alters the electronic structure, optimizing hydrogen adsorption and facilitating efficient HER. These findings suggest that B-doped C$_{36}$N$_{17}$ nanosheets could serve as efficient cocatalysts when combined with metallic materials, offering a promising approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications.</p>

            <h2>Topological magnons and domain walls in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the magnetic excitations in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a hole filling factor of $\nu=1$, focusing on magnon and domain wall excitations. Using a generalized interacting Kane-Mele model, we obtain the quantum anomalous Hall insualtor ground state with spin polarization. The magnon spectrum is then computed via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, revealing two low-energy topological magnon bands with opposite Chern numbers. To further explore the magnon topology, we construct a tight-binding model for the magnon bands, which is analogous to the Haldane model. We also calculate the energy cost of domain walls that separate regions with opposite Chern numbers and bind chiral edge states. Finally, we propose an effective spin model that describes both magnon and domain wall excitations, incorporating Heisenberg spin interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The coupling constants in this model are determined from the numerical results for magnons and domain walls. This model accounts for the Ising anisotropy of the system, captures the magnon topology, and allows for the estimation of the magnetic ordering temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of magnetic excitations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and offer new insights into collective excitations in moiré systems.</p>

            <p>States with long coherence are a crucial requirement for qubits and quantum memories. Nuclear spins in epitaxial quantum dots are a great candidate, offering excellent isolation from external environments and on-demand coupling to optical flying qubits. However, coherence times are limited to $\lesssim1$ ms by the dipole-dipole interactions between the nuclei and their quadrupolar coupling to inhomogeneous crystal strain. Here, we combine strain engineering of the nuclear spin ensemble and tailored dynamical decoupling sequences to achieve nuclear spin coherence times exceeding 100 ms. Recently, a reversible transfer of quantum information into nuclear spin ensembles has been demonstrated in quantum dots. Our results provide a path to develop this concept into a functioning solid-state quantum memory suitable for quantum repeaters in optical quantum communication networks.</p>

            <p>Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</p>

            <h2>Active Solids: Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fridtjof Brauns, Myles O'Leary, Arthur Hernandez, Mark J. Bowick, M. Cristina Marchetti</p>
            <p>The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranit Mukherjee, Zih-Yin Chen, Xiang Cheng, Sungyon Lee</p>
            <p>Fluid-fluid interfaces laden with discrete particles behave curiously like continuous elastic sheets, leading to their applications in emulsion and foam stabilization. Although existing continuum models can qualitatively capture the elastic buckling of these particle-laden interfaces -- often referred to as particle rafts -- under compression, they fail to link their macroscopic collective properties to the microscopic behaviors of individual particles. Thus, phenomena such as particle expulsion from the compressed rafts remain unexplained. Here, by combining systematic experiments with first-principle modeling, we reveal how the macroscopic mechanical properties of particle rafts emerge from particle-scale interactions. We construct a phase diagram that delineates the conditions under which a particle raft collapses via collective folding versus single-particle expulsion. Guided by this theoretical framework, we demonstrate control over the raft's failure mode by tuning the physicochemical properties of individual particles. Our study highlights the previously overlooked dual nature of particle rafts and exemplifies how collective dynamics can arise from discrete components with simple interactions.</p>

            <p>Cells and cellular organelles are encapsulated by nanometrically thin membranes whose main component is a lipid bilayer. In the presence of electric fields, the ion-impermeable lipid bilayer acts as a capacitor and supports a potential difference across the membrane. We analyze the charging dynamics of a planar membrane separating bulk solutions with different electrolyte concentrations upon the application of an applied uniform DC electric field. The membrane is modeled as a zero-thickness capacitive interface. The evolution of the electric potential and ions distributions in the bulk are solved for using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. Asymptotic solutions are derived in the limit of thin Debye layers and weak fields (compared to the thermal electric potential).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaswat Mohanty, Jose Blanchet, Zhigang Suo, Wei Cai</p>
            <p>Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Wang, Patrick Liu, Lijun Wu, Jing Tao, Genda Gu, Alfred Zong, Yimei Zhu</p>
            <p>A number of intriguing phenomena, including exciton condensation, orbital ordering, and emergence of chirality, have been proposed to accompany charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$. Explaining these effects relies on knowledge of the atomic displacement pattern underlying the CDW, yet structural proposals based on spatially-averaging bulk crystal diffraction and surface-dependent scanning tunneling microscopy have remained inconsistent. Here, we revisit the CDW superlattice structure with selected-area electron diffraction, a bulk-sensitive probe capable of capturing sub-micrometer spatial variations while maintaining high momentum resolution. We resolved two distinct, spatially separated CDW phases characterized by different interlayer ordering. In both phases, previously reported atomic displacement patterns fail to account for the observed extinction rules. Instead, our analysis reveals a new superlattice structure, which features a large number of nearly degenerate CDW domains. These findings not only provide a new basis for understanding the gyrotropic electronic order and metastability in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, they also underscore the importance of bulk-sensitive mesoscopic techniques in investigating materials that host unconventional superlattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. Conversely, for an initially flat-band system with compactly localized wave functions, the NESS is delocalized. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial state is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial state weakens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

            <p>Kitaev quantum spin liquids have attracted significant attention in condensed matter physics over the past decade. To understand their emergent quantum phenomena, high-quality single crystals of substantial size are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate RuBr3, achieving millimeter-sized crystals through a self-flux method under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The crystals exhibit well-defined cleavage planes with a lustrous appearance. Transport characterizations exhibit a narrow band-gap semiconducting behavior with 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV band-gap in ab plane and along c axis, respectively. Magnetic measurement shows a transition to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at approximately 29 K both in ab plane and along c axis. Notably, the Néel temperature increases to 34 K with an applied magnetic field of up to 7 T in the ab plane, but without any change along c axis. The large size and high quality of RuBr3 single crystals provide a valuable platform for investigating various interactions, particularly the Kitaev interaction, and for elucidating the intrinsic physical properties of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</p>

            <p>A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the conditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identified. A rigorous threshold between ``slow" and ``fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expression for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Simultaneous breaking of time reversal and inversion symmetries in multiferroics couples ferroelectricity to magnetism and is a source of unusual physical phenomena that can be used in next-generation electronic devices. A notable example is DyFeO$_3$, which under applied magnetic fields exhibits a giant linear magnetoelectric response and a large spontaneous electric polarization induced by coexisting orders of Fe and Dy spins. Here, we use high-resolution neutron diffraction to show that at zero field DyFeO$_3$ hosts an incommensurate magnetic soliton lattice formed by spatially ordered Dy domain walls with an average domain size of 231(8) Å. The long-ranged interaction between the domain walls is mediated by magnons propagating through the Fe subsystem and is analogous to the Yukawa force in particle physics. An applied magnetic field destroys the long-ranged incommensurate order, unlocks the linear magnetoelectric response and stabilizes the ferroelectric state. The magnetic domain walls are electrically charged and the soliton array dimerizes when both electric and magnetic fields are applied. Numerical simulations with experimental parameters suggest, that the generic competition between the ferroelectric and incommensurate states can be effectively controlled by an applied electric field.</p>

            <p>Alkali-doped fullerides are molecular-based superconductors with multiple active orbitals. In this paper, using the Eliashberg theory with the retardation effect of Jahn-Teller phonons, we study the response of the spin-singlet superconducting state relevant to fulleride materials. The spin Zeeman field is not active for the singlet pairing state, and the magnetic orbital field, which physically generates a circular electron motion inside the fullerene molecule, is also shown to be inactive. On the other hand, the electric orbital (or quadrupolar) field, which corresponds to a uniaxial distortion, remains active across the superconducting phase transition. This is understood by the orbital-symmetric structure of the Cooper pair, which is susceptible to the electric orbital field, while it is not the case for the magnetic orbital field which tends to create an antisymmetric part.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmitry Miserev, Joel Hutchinson, Herbert Schoeller, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss</p>
            <p>In this letter we consider $D$-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids, and demonstrate that an attractive interaction with a finite range $R_s$ that is much greater than the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F$ breaks the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity. In contrast to the BCS prediction of a finite superconducting gap for all attractive contact interactions, we show that a finite-range interaction does not induce a superconducting gap. Instead, the pair susceptibility develops a power-law singularity at zero momentum and zero frequency signaling quantum critical behavior without long-range ordering. Starting from this, we show that superconductivity can be stabilized by adding a short-range attractive interaction, which is always present in real electronic systems. As an example, we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional material with attractive electron-electron interactions mediated by optical phonons. We demonstrate a dome shape of the critical temperature $T_c$ versus doping, strongly suppressed isotope effect, and a weak dependence of the optimal doping and maximal $T_c^* \sim 0.1 E_F$ on the interaction range at $R_s \gg \lambda_F$, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy. We believe that these results could be relevant to high-temperature superconductors.</p>

            <p>Through an effective quantum field theory within Bogoliubov's framework and taking into account nonuniversal effects of the interatomic potential we analytically derive the leading Gaussian zero- and finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state of ultracold interacting Bose-Bose gases. We calculate the ground-state energy per particle at zero and low temperature for three- two- and one-dimensional two-component bosonic gases. By tuning the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of a self-bound liquidlike phase or droplet with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions DNUC) is favorable. At zero temperature in three-dimensions and considering the nonuniversal corrections to the attractive interactions as a fitting parameter the energy per particle for DNUC is in good agreement with some diffusion Monte Carlo results. In two dimensions the DNUC present small deviations regarding conventional droplets. For the one-dimensional DNUC the handling of the nonuniversal effects to the interactions achieves a qualitative agreement with the trend of some available Monte Carlo data in usual droplets. We also introduce some improved Gross-Pitaevskii equations to describe self-trapped DNUC in three, two and one dimension. We briefly discuss some aspects at low temperature regarding nonuniversal corrections to the interactions in Bose-Bose gases. We derive the dependencies on the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions but also on the difference between intra- and inter-species coupling constants. This last dependence crucially affect the three- and the two-dimensional DNUC driving thus to a thermal-induced instability. This thermal instability is also present in one-dimensional Bose-Bose gases, but it is not relevant on the formation of DNUC...</p>

We discuss progress from the perspective of materials development, including structural phase transitions, synthesis methods, electrical properties, and device implementation. Finally, we emphasize the major challenges that must be addressed for practical applications of these phase-change materials and provide our outlook on the future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

We show that discerning whether the AHE is an intrinsic property of the field free system becomes intricate in the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations. {\color{black}As a study case,} we use the Weyl semimetal PrAlGe, where TRSB can be toggled via a ferromagnetic transition, providing a transparent view of the AHE's topological origin.

            <p>Superconducting diode effects (SDEs) generally emerge in superconducting systems where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, showing nonreciprocal current characteristics: nondissipative in one direction and ohmic in the opposite. Since the discovery of the SDEs by Ando et al. in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor [Nb/V/Ta]n in 2020, notable progress has been achieved on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. It has been proposed that intrinsic SDEs are closely linked to various exotic superconducting states, such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, topological superconductivity, and chiral superconductivity. Recently, SDEs have emerged as important experimental tools for detecting symmetry breaking in exotic superconducting states. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental nature of SDEs but also opens new possibilities for their applications in superconducting physics and related fields. This review focuses on the recent experimental progress in the observation of the SDEs and discusses their primary mechanisms from the perspective of material properties and symmetry breaking. Finally, we summarize the observed rectification efficiency of SDE devices and discuss future research directions in this rapidly developing field.</p>

            <p>This article explores the structural properties of molecular beam epitaxy grown {CdO/MgO} superlattices on sapphire substrates of different crystallographic orientations (a-, c-, r-, and m-plane). The investigations involve a comprehensive analysis using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution X-ray diffraction studies unveil a significant influence of surface symmetry on both the substrates and the epitaxial layers, particularly with respect to the occurrence of twins in the superlattices. Remarkably, no twins are observed on r-oriented sapphire substrates, resulting in improved interface and crystallographic quality. The results of studies demonstrated in this work show that the growth rate of CdO sublayers within {CdO/MgO} superlattices is intricately dependent on the substrate orientation. Notably, the c-plane and m-plane sapphire substrates yielded thicker CdO sublayers, indicating comparable growth rates for these crystallographic orientations. Conversely, the a-plane and r-plane orientations seemed to favor a slower growth rate of CdO sublayers.</p>

            <p>The layer-resolved quantum transport response of a twisted bilayer graphene device is investigated by driving a current through the bottom layer and measuring the induced voltage in the top layer. Devices with four- and eight-layer differentiated contacts were analyzed, revealing that in a nanoribbon geometry (four contacts), a counterflow current emerges in the top layer, while in a square-junction configuration (eight contacts), this counterflow is accompanied by a transverse, or Hall, component. These effects persist despite weak coupling to contacts, onsite disorder, and variations in device size. The observed counterflow response indicates a circulating interlayer current, which generates an in-plane magnetic moment excited by the injected current. Finally, due to the intricate relationship between the electrical layer response, energy, and twist angle, a clusterized machine learning model was trained, validated, and tested to predict various conductances.</p>

At low temperatures, quantum tunneling plays a dominant role in the desorption process of both hydrogen monomers and dimers.

For the ortho-dimers, the dominant desorption mechanism is found to switch from the molecular mechanism to the atomic mechanism above a critical temperature, which is respectively ~ 300 K and 200 K for H and D.</p>

In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</p>

            <p>The kapellasite family $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$(Cl,Br)$_{3-x}$ forms a series of compounds, wherein the chemical pressure realized by the $A-$site cation tunes the spin exchange in the frustrated distorted kagome lattice. Via hydrothermal synthesis we have grown single crystals of the whole series for $A=$ rare-earths and found a clear structural transition to a superstructure variant at a specific chemical pressure level exerted by $A$~=~Dy. Phases with crystal structures in the vicinity of this superstructure transition realize a distorted kagome lattice of the Cu$^{2+}$ cations with characteristic features of a spin liquid. Here, subtle structural disorder as well as controlled chemical pressure can stabilize the spin liquid phase. We study the crystal structure and the magnetic ground state of these phases via single crystal x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and muon spin spectroscopy measurements.</p>

            <h2>Diffusive spin transport of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain in the Ising regime at zero magnetic field and finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose M. P. Carmelo, Pedro D. Sacramento</p>
            <p>The studies of this paper on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain at finite temperatures T>0 have two complementary goals. The first is to identify the spin carriers of all its Sq>0 energy eigenstates and to show that their spin elementary currents fully control the spin-transport quantities. Here Sq is the q-spin of the continuous SUq(2) symmetry of the model for anisotropy >1. To achieve this goal, our studies rely on a suitable exact physical-spin this http URL the spin stiffness and the zero-field spin-diffusion constant are expressed in terms of thermal expectation values of the square of the elementary currents carried by the spin carriers. Our second goal is to confirm that the zero-field and finite-temperature spin transport is normal diffusive for anisotropy >1. We use two complementary methods that rely on an inequality for the T>0 spin stiffness and the above thermal expectation values, respectively, to show that the contributions to ballistic spin transport vanish. Complementarily, for T>0 and anisotropy >1, the spin-diffusion constant is found to be finite and enhanced upon lowering T, reaching its largest yet finite values at low temperatures. Evidence suggests that it diverges in the anisotropy limit to 1 for T>0, consistent with T>0 anomalous superdiffusive spin transport at anisotropy 1 and zero field.</p>

            <h2>Magnetization symmetry for the MnTe altermagnetic candidate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.N. Orlova, V.D. Esin, A.V. Timonina, N.N. Kolesnikov, E.V. Deviatov</p>
            <p>We experimentally investigate the magnetization angle dependence $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of MnTe altermagnetic candidate. In high magnetic fields, experimental $M(\alpha)$ curves nearly independent of temperature, they mostly reflect standard antiferromagnetic spin-flop processes below the Néel vector reorientation field. In contrast, $M(\alpha)$ dependences are quite unusual at low temperatures and in low magnetic fields: below 81~K, spontaneous magnetization appears as a sharp $M(T)$ magnetization jump, the easy axis direction is equally $\pi/2$ rotated either by increasing the field above 1~kOe or the temperature above 81~K. We provide experimental arguments that the spontaneous magnetization of MnTe below 81~K differs strongly from the well known weak ferromagnetism of conventional antiferromagnetics, thus, it requires to take into account formation of the altermagnetic ground state. Despite the MnTe altermagnetic state is expected to be g-wave, i.e. $\pi/3$ periodic one, our experiment confirms the prevailing population of one from three easy axes, as it has been shown previously by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>We substitute individual Pt atoms into monolayer MoS$_2$ and study the resulting atomic structures with single-sideband (SSB) ptychography supported by ab initio simulations. We demonstrate that while high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging provides excellent Z-contrast, distinguishing some defect types such as single and double sulfur vacancies remains challenging due to their low relative contrast difference. However, SSB with its nearly linear Z-contrast and high phase sensitivity enables reliable identification of these defect configurations as well as various Pt dopant structures at significantly lower electron doses. Our findings uncover the precise atomic placement and highlight the potential of SSB ptychography for detailed structural analysis of dopant-modified 2D materials while minimizing beam-induced damage, offering new pathways for understanding and engineering atomic-scale features in 2D systems.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta</p>
            <p>We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty are more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb by employing a mean-field approximation. Further, we explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</p>

            <p>Interest in studying the conductive properties of networks made from randomly distributed nanowires is due to their numerous technological applications. Although the sheet resistance of such networks can be calculated directly, the calculations require many characteristics of the system (distributions of lengths, diameters and resistances of nanowires, distribution of junction resistance), the measurement of which is difficult. Furthermore, such calculations can hardly offer an analytical dependence of the sheet resistance on the basic physical parameters of the systems under consideration. Although various theoretical approaches offer such analytical dependencies, they are often based on more or less reasonable assumptions rather than rigorously proven statements. Here, we offer an approach based on Foster's theorem to reveal a dependence of the sheet resistance of dense nanowire networks on the main parameters of such networks. This theorem offers an additional perspective on the effective medium theory and extends our insight.</p>

            <p>High intensity coherent light can dress matter, realizing new hybrid phases that are not accessible in equilibrium. This effect results from the coherent interaction between Bloch states inside the solid and the periodic field of impinging photons which produces hybrid light-matter states called Floquet-Bloch states that can alter properties of the solid. Optically inducing a topological state in a semiconductor using so-called Floquet engineering is an exciting prospect. However, it has not been realized, despite its theoretical prediction more than 10 years ago. Here we show that an ultrashort-lived topological state that is absent at equilibrium in the ground state of SnTe can be created with femtosecond light pulses. This occurs when the photoexcitation is similar in energy with the band gap of this polar semiconductor. We observe a concomitant renormalization of the band dispersions that reveals the generation of Floquet states connecting to the topological state. We therefore provide the first direct experimental observation of a Floquet topological state and propose that it is driven by a light-induced band inversion in SnTe. Our discovery opens the way for controlling optically on-demand the topological properties of semiconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Begué, Maria Grazia Proietti, José Ignacio Arnaudas, Miguel Ciria</p>
            <p>The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered an advantageous alternative to their celebrated two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals akin compound, graphene, for a number of applications, especially those requiring a gapped and possibly tunable band structure. Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the irreversible effects of an applied electric field on the magnetotransport properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 conducting interfaces, with focus on their multiband character. We study samples of different types, namely with either crystalline or amorphous LaAlO3 overlayer. Our two-band analysis highlights the similarity of the electronic properties of crystalline and amorphous interfaces, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities. Furthermore, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns, at least in qualitative terms, in the two types of samples. In agreement with previous works on crystalline interfaces, we observe that an irreversible charge depletion takes place after application of a first positive back gate voltage step. Such charge depletion affects much more, in relative terms, the higher and three-dimensional dyz, dzx bands than the lower and bidimensional dxy, driving the system through the Lifshitz transition from two-band to single band behavior. The quantitative analysis of experimental data evidences the roles of disorder, apparent in the depletion regime, and temperature. Noteworthy, filling and depletion of the two bands follow very similar patterns in crystalline and amorphous samples, at least in qualitative terms, regardless much different carrier densities and mobilities.</p>

            <h2>Topology from Nothing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</p>

Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.</p>

Remarkably, reversing the magnetic field enables a directional switch between non-reciprocal fast and slow light. This discovery may offer new possibilities for pulse time regulation in microwave signal communications, neuromorphic computing, and quantum signal processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amey P. Pasarkar, Adji Bousso Dieng</p>
            <p>The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures and phenomena. In parallel, the rise of data-driven science has underscored the need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics -- and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a powerful tool for data-driven science.</p>

            <p>In this work, we establish the equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and quantum Green's functions. Drawing on the analogy between margin maximization in SVMs and action extremization in Lagrangian mechanics, we show that many standard kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions and that this correspondence arises from the inversion of physical operators. We further demonstrate how positive semi-definiteness, which is essential for valid SVM kernels, aligns with the spectral properties that ensure well-defined Green's functions. We employ the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) to create custom kernels for cases where the commonly employed kernels don't lead to a convergence. These custom kernels approximate the desired Green's functions. We furthermore demonstrate numerically on examples taken from physical problems, such as electrical conductivity, scattering amplitudes, photonic crystals, and energy levels of anharmonic oscillators, that selecting kernel functions that mirror the mathematical form of the associated Green's function can significantly enhance the predictive accuracy of machine learning models.</p>

Here, we present a new design based on virtual load, where a low-frequency coil with a frequency of up to 30\,MHz, functions as both an inductor and a power-sharing element in a capacitive transformer circuit. This design enables a highly efficient RF circuit with tunable matching bandwidth. It integrates broadband and narrowband coils into a compact configuration, overcoming the distance limitations of metallic chambers. The broadband RF system, tested in a 10-second evaporative cooling experiment, reduced input power from 14.7\,dBW to -3.5\,dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10\,$\mu$K. The narrowband RF system was tested in a Landau-Zener experiment and transferred 80\,\% of Rb atoms from |F=2, m_F=2> to |2, -2> in 1 second, yielding a Rabi frequency of 7.6\,kHz at 0.1\,dBW. The power-sharing properties of the virtual load ensure impedance closely matches the ideal lumped-element simulations, demonstrating the design's robustness to disturbances.</p>

            <p>Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.</p>

The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</p>

            <p>Atomically thin semiconductors exhibit tunable exciton resonances that can be harnessed for dynamic manipulation of visible light in ultra-compact metadevices. However, the rapid nonradiative decay and dephasing of excitons at room temperature limits current active excitonic metasurfaces to few-percent efficiencies. Here, we leverage the combined merits of pristine 2D heterostructures and non-local dielectric metasurfaces to enhance the excitonic light-matter interaction, achieving strong and electrically tunable exciton-photon coupling at ambient conditions in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface. Using this, we realize a free-space optical modulator and experimentally demonstrate 9.9 dB of reflectance modulation. The electro-optic response, characterized by a continuous transition from strong to weak coupling, is mediated by gating-induced variations in the free carrier concentration altering the excitons nonradiative decay rate.

            <h2>Parameterizing empirical interatomic potentials for predicting thermophysical properties via an irreducible derivative approach: the case of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$</h2>

            <p>The accuracy of classical physical property predictions using molecular dynamics simulations is determined by the quality of the interatomic potentials. Here we introduce a training approach for empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) which is well suited for capturing phonons and phonon-related properties. Our approach is based on direct comparisons of the second- and third-order irreducible derivatives between an EIP and the Born-Oppenheimer potential within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Irreducible derivatives fully exploit space group symmetry and allow for training without redundant information. We demonstrate the fidelity of our approach in the context of ThO$_2$ and UO$_2$, where we optimize parameters of an embedded-atom method potential in addition to core-shell interactions. Our EIPs provide thermophysical properties in good agreement with DFT and outperform widely utilized EIPs for phonon dispersion and thermal conductivity predictions. Reasonable estimates of thermal expansion and formation energies of Frenkel pairs are also obtained.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying `local softness' in a simple liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamoghna Das</p>
            <p>Mutual information between local stress and local non-affine deformation is proposed as a collective field variable quantifying the {\em local softness} of soft materials. The liquid-solid transition in a simple liquid is considered as a generic example of mechanical transformation through varying correlation between stress and deformation at the microscopic level. Probing through this new measure, a liquid appears as a spatially heterogeneous medium of interacting interconnected regions of varying softness. In contrast, the soft regions shrink to isolated spots in the background of a negligible mean softness in the case of solids. In this view, the thermodynamic transition becomes purely geometric while keeping the essential mechanical information intact. Besides offering a general framework for understanding the mechanics of materials, this new approach can complement recent machine learning efforts by assigning physical meaning to their findings. Further, this collective variable can be used on the fly during material characterization as both of its ingredient variables are experimentally accessible.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi Zeng, Yu-Rong Shu, Zi-Xiang Li, Shuai Yin</p>
            <p>Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless, the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly, a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the short-imaginary-time stage is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases. Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Modelling the mechanics of 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet using numerical simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpit Kumar Srivastava, Enric Pardo</p>
            <p>High temperature REBCO superconducting tapes are very promising for high-field magnets. Under high magnetic fields there are high electro-mechanical forces, and thus concern for mechanical damage. Due to large screening currents and composite structure of the tape, the mechanical design of these magnets are not straightforward. In addition, many present designs use insulated winding. In this work we develop a novel two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element tool programmed in MATLAB that assumes the displacement field within linear elastic range. The stack of pancakes and a large number of REBCO tape turns are approximated as an anisotropic bulk hollow cylinder. Our results agree with uni-axial stress experiments in literature, validating the bulk approximation. Here, we study the following configuration. The current is first ramp up to below the critical current and we calculate the screening currents and the forces that they cause using the MEMEP model. As a case study 32 T REBCO superconductor magnet is simulated numerically. We have done complete mechanical analysis of the magnet by including the axial and shear mechanical quantities for each pancake unlike previous work where only radial and circumferential quantities are focused. Effect on mechanical quantities without screening current is also calculated and compared. It is shown that including screening current induced field strongly affect the mechanical quantities, specially the shear stress. The latter might be the critical quantity for certain magnet configurations. Additionally, in order to overcome high stresses, a stiff over banding of different material is considered and numerically modelled which significantly reduces the mechanical stresses. The FE based model developed is efficient to calculate the mechanical behaviour of any general superconductor magnet and its devices.</p>

            <p>The observation of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here, we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ as hydrostatic pressure is applied and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure's compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and nonmagnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, while the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders -- a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most likely a charge density wave -- with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a maximum coupling rate of 0.91. Our investigation shows the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. We compare coupling strength values derived from the gap size from the measured spectrum with those calculated directly through the coupling parameter and show that the gap size as a measure of coupling strength is limited for the ultra-strong coupling regime. Additionally, analytical calculations show the possibility to reach the deep-strong coupling regime by engineering the magnetic anisotropy. These findings highlight the potential of vdW AFMs as a model case to study magnetisation dynamics in low-symmetry magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang</p>
            <p>A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritajit Kundu, Arijit Kundu</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the transport properties of Josephson junctions composed of superconductor/minimally twisted bilayer graphene/superconductor structures. In the presence of an out-of-plane electric field, the low energy physics is best described by a network of chiral domain-wall states. Depending on system parameters, they lead to the emergence of zig-zag or pseudo-Landau level modes with distinct transport characteristics. Specifically, we find zig-zag modes feature linear dispersion of Andreev bound states, resulting in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson current. In contrast, pseudo-Landau level modes exhibit flat Andreev bound states and, consequently, a vanishing bulk Josephson current. Interestingly, edge states can give rise to $4\pi$-periodic Josephson response in the pseudo-Landau level regime. We also discuss experimental signatures of such responses.</p>

This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.</p>

            <p>We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) for classical spin systems on hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p>4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.</p>

            <p>Spectroscopic data, particularly diffraction data, contain detailed crystal and microstructure information and thus are crucial for materials discovery. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are greatly effective in identifying crystals. Although machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced the analysis of powder XRD patterns, the progress is hindered by a lack of training data. To address this, we introduce SimXRD, the largest open-source simulated XRD pattern dataset so far, to accelerate the development of crystallographic informatics. SimXRD comprises 4,065,346 simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns, representing 119,569 distinct crystal structures under 33 simulated conditions that mimic real-world variations. We find that the crystal symmetry inherently follows a long-tailed distribution and evaluate 21 sequence learning models on SimXRD. The results indicate that existing neural networks struggle with low-frequency crystal classifications. The present work highlights the academic significance and the engineering novelty of simulated XRD patterns in this interdisciplinary field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Piccioni, Francesco Ferrari, Michele Fabrizio, Federico Becca</p>
            <p>The interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions is studied in a one-dimensional lattice model, by means of a variational Monte Carlo method based on generalized Jastrow-Slater wave functions. Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</p>

            <p>The Yang-Lee edge singularity is an intriguing critical phenomenon characterized by nonunitary field theory. However, its experimental realization for interacting many-body systems remains elusive. We show that Yang-Lee edge singularities, regarded as many-body exceptional points, can be observed using both the self-normal and the associated-biorthogonal Loschmidt echoes, leveraging the advantages of nonunitary dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. The Loschmidt echoes are demonstrated to display unitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime but exhibit nonunitary dynamics in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken regime, leading to a sharp change near an exceptional point. We hereby identify exceptional points in both the non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model and the Yang-Lee model, and determine the critical exponent that is consistent with nonunitary conformal field theory. This work provides a direct observation of Yang-Lee edge singularities in non-Hermitian many-body systems arising from nonunitary dynamics.</p>

            <p>HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics have emerged as promising materials for advanced nanoelectronics, with their robust polarization and silicon compatibility making them ideal for high-density, non-volatile memory applications. Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

            <p>A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than $1\,\%$ error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), enabling the mapping of microstructures to mechanical responses using solely physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields, Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. SPiFOL achieves significantly higher speed-up factors compared to conventional FFT solvers.</p>

The mid-infrared excitation through intra-atomic Fe $d$-$d$ transitions triggers markedly slower dynamics in comparison to an off-resonant pumping affecting both of the two sublattices simultaneously. By changing probe wavelength to move in and out of resonance with the Fe $d$-$d$ transitions, we also show the specific contributions of the Fe sublattice to these dynamics.</p>

In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Wang, Wu-Rong Jian, Wei Cai</p>
            <p>Jogs, atomic-scale steps on dislocations, play an important role in crystal plasticity, yet they are often ignored in discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations due to their small sizes. While jogs on screw dislocations are known to move non-conservatively (i.e. climb) accompanied by vacancy emission, jogs on edge dislocations are commonly expected to move conservatively (i.e. glide) with the dislocation under ambient conditions. Here we report unexpected findings from molecular dynamics simulations of an edge dislocation containing a pair of unit jogs in face-centered cubic nickel at 300K. While the jogs glide conservatively with the edge dislocation at low stresses, we observe that one of the jogs climbs and emits vacancies intermittently at higher stresses. This observation is unexpected at such a low temperature, as climb is typically associated with temperatures closer to the creep temperature (roughly half of the melting temperature). Our results highlight the significance of the complex interplay between point defects (i.e., vacancies) and dislocations in room-temperature plasticity, suggesting that these interactions may be more significant than previously thought.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenta Nagase, Soki Oshima, Hikaru Takahashi, Takashi Mukaiyama</p>
            <p>Using radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy, we measure the $p$-wave contacts in a Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. The RF spectrum exhibits clear asymptotic behavior, characterized by $\tilde{\omega}^{-1/2}$ and $\tilde{\omega}^{-3/2}$ dependencies. The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederic Bippus, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski</p>
            <p>The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</p>

            <h2>Transmission of radio-frequency waves and nuclear magnetic resonance in lanthanum superhydrides</h2>

            <p>The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. However, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of such superconductors severely limits the number of experimental techniques to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting transition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. A description of the $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$ data with an exponential form allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ lying between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxuan Liu, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu</p>
            <p>In moiré systems, the impact of lattice relaxation on electronic band structures is significant, yet the computational demands of first-principles relaxation are prohibitively high due to the large number of atoms involved. To address this challenge, We introduce a robust methodology for the construction of machine learning potentials specifically tailored for moiré structures and present an open-source software package DPmoire designed to facilitate this process. Utilizing this package, we have developed machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) materials. Our approach not only streamlines the computational process but also ensures accurate replication of the detailed electronic and structural properties typically observed in density functional theory (DFT) relaxations. The MLFFs were rigorously validated against standard DFT results, confirming their efficacy in capturing the complex interplay of atomic interactions within these layered materials. This development not only enhances our ability to explore the physical properties of moiré systems with reduced computational overhead but also opens new avenues for the study of relaxation effects and their impact on material properties in two-dimensional layered structures.</p>

            <h2>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. C. Levine, B. A. Friedman</p>
            <p>It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonatan Messica, Alex Levchenko, Dmitri B. Gutman</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition between elastic and viscous regimes for time-reversal broken Weyl semimetals. In these materials, Hall transport occurs through two parallel channels: the Fermi sea and the Fermi surface. The Fermi sea part remains unaffected by electron-electron scattering, whereas the Fermi surface is influenced by it. We model the disorder by dilute impenetrable spherical impurities. We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</p>

            <h2>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sharma, Amartya S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan. The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo</p>
            <p>Whether or not a quantum many-body system is integrable, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for deciding integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond the conventional artisanal methods in the study of nonintegrability. Furthermore, it partially resolves the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities with small supports. The proposed framework guarantees that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be confirmed algorithmically, regardless of system size.</p>

            <p>Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near-surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.</p>

            <p>Electronic flat bands associated with quenched kinetic energy and heavy electron mass have attracted great interest for promoting strong electronic correlations and emergent phenomena such as high-temperature charge fractionalization and superconductivity. Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich non-trivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4. Simultaneously, it opens a new path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d-orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.</p>

            <p>Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</p>

            <p>RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models.

            <p>Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.</p>

            <p>We propose a scheme to calibrate the internal parameters of a quantum annealer to obtain well-approximated samples for training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Empirically, samples from quantum annealers obey the Boltzmann distribution, making them suitable for RBM training. Quantum annealers utilize physical phenomena to generate a large number of samples in a short time. However, hardware imperfections make it challenging to obtain accurate samples. Existing research often estimates the inverse temperature for the compensation. Our scheme efficiently utilizes samples for RBM training also to estimate internal parameters. Furthermore, we consider additional parameters and demonstrate that they improve sample quality. We evaluate our approach by comparing the obtained samples with classical Gibbs sampling, which theoretically generates accurate samples. Our results indicate that our scheme demonstrates performance on par with Gibbs sampling. In addition, the training results with our estimation scheme outperform those of the contrastive divergence algorithm, a standard training algorithm for RBM.</p>

            <p>REBCO high-temperature superconductors are promising for fully superconducting high-field magnets, including ultra-high field magnets. Non-insulated (NI) and metal-insulated (MI) windings are a good solution for protection against electro-thermal quench. Design and optimization requires numerical modelling of REBCO inserts for high-field magnets. Here, we detail a fast and accurate two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional model for the electromagnetic response of NI and MI coils, which is based on the Minimum Electro Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP). Benchmarking with an $A-V$ formulation method on a double pancake coil shows good agreement. We also analyse a fully superconducting 32 T magnet with a REBCO insert and a low-temperature superconducing (LTS) outsert. In particular, we analyze the current density, the screening curren induced field (SCIF), and the AC loss. We have shown that metal-insulated coils enable transfer of angular current in the radial direction, and hence magnet protection, while keeping the same screening currents and AC loss of isolated coils, even at relatively high ramp rates of 1 A/s. Surprisingly, soldered coils with low resistance between turns present relatively low AC loss for over-current configuration, which might enable higher generated magnetic fields. The numerical method presented here can be applied to optimize high-field magnets regarding SCIF in MI or NI magnets. It also serves as the basis for future electro-thermal modelling and multi-physics modeling that also includes mechanical properties.</p>

In this paper, we investigate relation meticulously between the phase stiffness and the critical superconducting temperature for the Gubser-Rocha holographic superconductor model in the probe limit. The superfluid density (or phase stiffness) can be extracted from the low-frequency dependence of the AC conductivity. More importantly, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density on the critical superconducting temperature, which has a similarity to a recent experiment in a film cuprate. In addition, we also provide some approximate formulas for the critical temperatures and the AC conductivity.</p>

Targets that have support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. However, solving such eigenvalue problems on real-world data remains a challenge. Here, we consider cross-dataset learnability and show that one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data measures to reveal spectral bias on complex datasets and bound learnability on real-world data.

            <h2>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</p>

            <h2>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Marra, Angela Nigro</p>
            <p>Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</p>

            <h2>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability in phase field schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Benzi, Daniele La Pegna, Paolo Maria Mariano</p>
            <p>We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector-valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the considered phase field. The occurrence of non-normality requires to look at the pseudospectrum of the considered matrix, namely the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the matrix itself, because the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices can be very sensitive to small perturbations and therefore the spectral analysis alone would not be sufficient to distinguish with certainty between table and unstable behavior. We develop the relevant analyses in the case of quasicrystals for which the values of some constitutive parameters are not known or are uncertain from an experimental point of view, a circumstance suggesting parametric analyses. We find circumstances in which the pseudospectra obtained by means of the so-called structured perturbations predict instability when, instead, the spectral analysis indicates stability.</p>

            <p>A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) highlights that ML-MCTDH is particularly well-suited for handling anisotropic models and provides more reliable results for two-point observables across all tested cases. The behavior of the corresponding entanglement dynamics is analyzed to reveal the complexity of the quantum states. Our findings indicate that the rate of entanglement growth strongly depends on the interaction range and the presence of disorder. This particular relationship is then used to examine the convergence behavior of ML-MCTDH. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</p>

            <h2>A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Q Feng</p>
            <p>Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinyi Tian, Winston Lindqwister, Manolis Veveakis, Laura E. Dalton</p>
            <p>Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.</p>

            <p>Understanding and controlling fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with optically read qubits is a key focus of research, as they show high potential for detecting electric and magnetic fields, temperature, and other physico-chemical quantities at the nanoscale, which are highly sought after in chemistry and biology. Proper functionalization of FNDs is required for their application as probes in chemical and biological processes. However, modifying the surface of FNDs can affect the properties of qubit sensors. In this work, we thoroughly study the fundamental properties of embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as a function of FND size and surface termination. The FNDs were produced by milling high-pressure, high-temperature diamonds, and NV centers were introduced via electron beam irradiation and annealing. In particular, the initial FNDs, covered with various oxygen groups, were homogenized through a reduction process to predominantly cover them with alcohol ($-$OH) groups as reference FNDs. Additionally, a Hofmann degradation process was applied to terminate FNDs with amine ($-$NH$_2$) groups, enabling direct linkage of proteins and other biomolecules to the FNDs. We monitored the charge state stability upon illumination, the zero-field splitting parameters, and the longitudinal spin-relaxation time of the NV centers in these FNDs. Our findings indicate that charge state stabilization of the NV centers was achieved in both $-$OH- and $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs beyond a certain FND size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $-$NH$_2$-terminated FNDs embedding NV centers exhibit a $T_1$ longitudinal relaxation time of approximately 25~$\mu$s, independent of FND size within the studied range of 10~nm to 140~nm. This relaxation time is comparable to that of larger-sized reference FNDs.</p>

            <h2>Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanting Cheng, Shang Liu</p>
            <p>Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Romen, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.</p>

By varying the confinement strength of excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, we show that long-lived Rydberg states of the confined electron-hole pairs appear in the continuum background. The accuracy of calculations of the linewidths based on the coupled-channel Schrödinger equation with three channels and only few basis states is confirmed by a numerically exact solution employing a B-spline basis and the complex coordinate-rotation method. We argue that finite-sized cuprous oxide crystals, due to their large exciton binding energies, are a convenient platform for experimental identification of BICs.</p>

            <p>We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</p>

            <p>The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</p>

            <p>We consider the propagation of a classical microwave pulse through a simple setup of a quantum metamaterial composed of a large number of three-Josephson-junction flux qubits. We find that population inversion and electromagnetic waves propagate together as two-component nonlinear waves, exhibiting distinct features depending on the initial preparation of the qubit subsystem and the strength of the "matter"-light interaction. Three different regimes are observed. In the limit of weak nonlinearity, when all qubits are initially prepared in either the clockwise or counterclockwise persistent current state, population inversion undergoes coherent Rabi-like oscillations, with a complete transfer between these two opposite states. As nonlinearity approaches unity, the transition dynamics lose their oscillatory nature, and the system rapidly becomes frozen in a state of zero population inversion, where each qubit is trapped in a superposition with equal probabilities of clockwise and counterclockwise polarity. In the overcritical regime, population inversion exhibits pulsating behavior, but without complete transfer. In the extreme coupling limit, population inversion undergoes small-amplitude oscillations around its initial value, while the pulse amplitude oscillates around zero, indicating pulse stopping.</p>

            <p>The confinement of electromagnetic radiation to subwavelength scales relies on strong light-matter interactions. In the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) spectral ranges, phonon polaritons are commonly employed to achieve extremely subdiffractional light confinement, with much lower losses as compared to plasmon polaritons. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons in anisotropic materials offer a highly promising platform for light confinement, which, however, typically plateaus at values of {\lambda}0/100, with {\lambda}0 being the free-space incident wavelength. In this study, we report on ultraconfined phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides with confinement factors exceeding {\lambda}0/250 in the terahertz spectral range. This extreme light compression within deeply sub-wavelength thin films is enabled by the unprecedented magnitude of the light-matter coupling strength in these compounds, and the natural hyperbolicity of HfSe2 in particular. Our findings emphasize the critical role of light-matter coupling for polariton confinement, which for phonon polaritons in polar dielectrics is dictated by the transverse-longitudinal optic phonon energy splitting. Our results demonstrate transition metal dichalcogenides as an enabling platform for THz nanophotonic applications that push the limits of light control.</p>

Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field, the Josephson junction can enter the topological phase and host zero-energy Majorana bound states over a range of the superconducting phase difference centered around $\pi$, with the span of this range determined by the strength of the magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.</p>

Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Rényi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.</p>

            <h2>The Saga of $α$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams</h2>

            <p>RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

            <h2>Effects of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darshana Wickramaratne, Marc Currie, Shelby S. Fields, Cory D. Cress, Steven P. Bennett</p>
            <p>RuO$_2$, one of the most widely studied transition metal oxides, was recently predicted to host a novel form of collinear magnetic order referred to as altermagnetism. In this study we combine experiment (reflectance, transmittance, ellipsometry and Raman measurements) and first-principles calculations to elucidate the potential role of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$ grown on TiO$_2$ (001), (101) and (110) substrates. The combination of experiment and theory in this study surprisingly indicates RuO$_2$ is in fact best described if one assumes the nonmagnetic state. Calculations of the altermagnetic state leads to poor agreement with the measured optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic Strain Relaxation-Induced Directional Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in RuO2 Films</h2>

            <p>Ultrafast light-matter interactions inspire potential functionalities in picosecond optoelectronic applications. However, achieving directional carrier dynamics in metals remains challenging due to strong carrier scattering within a multiband environment, typically expected to isotropic carrier relaxation. In this study, we demonstrate epitaxial RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy to engineer polarization-selectivity of ultrafast light-matter interactions via anisotropic strain engineering. Combining spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we revealed the strong anisotropic transient optoelectronic response of strain-engineered RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures along both in-plane [001] and [1-10] crystallographic directions. Theoretical analysis identifies strain-induced modifications in band nesting as the underlying mechanism for enhanced anisotropic carrier relaxation. These findings establish epitaxial strain engineering as a powerful tool for tuning anisotropic optoelectronic responses in metallic systems, paving the way for next-generation polarization-sensitive ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Metal-to-superconductor Transition Induced by Lithium Adsorption on Monolayer 1$T$-Nb$_2$C</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lingxiao Xiong, Yuhui Yan, Feipeng Zheng</p>
            <p>Recently, two-dimensional Nb$_2$C has garnered increasing attention due to its functional-group-dependent superconductivity, both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the halogen and chalcogen additives that have been the main focus of previous studies, we study the effect of lithium adsorption, which can also be incorporated during the synthesis of Nb$_2$C. Our computational analysis reveals a metal-to-superconductor transition in monolayer Nb$_2$C with a critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 22.1 K and a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution following the adsorption of lithium atoms. This emergent superconductivity is attributed to the increased electronic states at the Fermi energy, resulting from the contribution of Nb-$d$ orbitals and electron gas states induced by the low electronegativity of lithium. Furthermore, the application of tensile strain raises the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ to 24 K, which is higher than that of most functional-group-modified Nb$_2$C systems. Our work deepens the understanding of electron-phonon coupling in layered Nb$_2$C, and provides new insights into achieving high critical temperature superconductivity with a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution in this system.</p>

            <h2>The effect of duty cycle on electron transmission through a graphene electrostatic barrier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Biswas, S. Mukhopadhyay, C. Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigated theoretically the transmission properties of Dirac Fermions tunneling through a periodically (sinusoidal and rectangular) driven electrostatic barrier in Monolayer graphene. For the time harmonic potential with moderate to high alpha (=amplitude/frequency) the central Floquet band is found to be almost cloaked for the Klein transmitted electron in contrast to electron at higher grazing incidences. As a time periodic drive, we mainly focused on the use of rectangular wave electric signal to modulate the transparency of the barrier. It is noted that the asymmetric Fano resonance, a characteristic feature of photon assisted tunneling, is more likely to occur for rectangular drive in contrast to the harmonic one. The height of the modulating potential is particularly responsible for the dressing effect of the barrier. The position and nature of the FR can be tailored by changing the height and frequency of the rectangular drive. Moreover, the duty cycle of the driving potential turns out to be an important controlling parameter for the transmission process. Thus, the rectangular modulation plays an important role for the occurrence and detection of the Fano resonances which is vital for the use of graphene nanostructure in the field of detectors, sensors, modulators etc. The present findings attempt for the first time, to realize the effect of duty cycle on the quantum interference in semiconductor nanostructures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometry and the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media</h2>

            <p>The electric magnetochiral anisotropy is a nonreciprocal phenomenon accessible via second harmonic transport in noncentrosymmetric, time-reversal invariant materials, in which the rectification of current, ${\bf I}$, can be controlled by an external magnetic field, ${\bf B}$. Quantum geometry, which characterizes the topology of Bloch electrons in a Hilbert space, provides a powerful description of the nonlinear dynamics in topological materials. Here, we demonstrate that the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media owes its existence to the quantum metric, arising from the spin-orbit coupling, and to large Born effective charges. In this context, the reciprocal magnetoresistance $\beta{\bf B}^2$ is modified to $R( I,P,B)=R_0[1+\beta B^2 + \gamma^{\pm}{\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})]$, where the chirality dependent $\gamma^{\pm}$ is determined by the quantum metric dipole and the polarization ${\bf P}$. We predict a universal scaling $\gamma^{\pm}(V)\sim V^{-5/2}$ which we verified by phase sensitive, second harmonic transport measurements on hydrothermally grown 2D tellurium films under applied gate voltage, $V$. The control of rectification by varying ${\bf I}$, ${\bf P}$, ${\bf B}$, and $V$, demonstrated in this work, opens up new avenues for the building of ultra-scaled CMOS circuits.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of an InAs nanowire weak link embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy of spin-degenerate and spin-orbit split Andreev bound states for the shorter and longer weak links, respectively. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which results in a measured coupling strength reaching 1.95 GHz to the Andreev level and 77 MHz to the Andreev spin. Our spectroscopic data are in good agreement with existing theoretical models and demonstrate ultrastrong coupling to the Andreev pair qubit with the coupling strength approaching the bare resonator and qubit frequencies.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons flows within closed quantum circuits can spontaneously form phase-locked modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). With its infinite set of angular momentum quantum numbers, high-order OAM represents a transformative solution to the bandwidth bottleneck in multiplexed optical communication. However, its practical application is hindered by the limited choice of materials which in general requires cryogenic temperatures and the reliance on mechanical switching. In this work, we achieve stable and high-order (up to order of 33) OAM modes by constructing a closed quantum circuit using the halide perovskite microcavities at room temperature. By controlling the spatial and temporal symmetry of the closed quantum circuits using another laser pulse, we achieve significant tuning OAM of EP flows from 8 to 12. Our work demonstrate all-optical and ultrafast control of high-order OAM using exciton-polariton condensates in perovskite microcavities that would have important applications in high-throughput optical communications.</p>

            <p>A major obstacle to understanding high-Tc cuprates is that superconductivity precludes observing normal-state properties at low temperatures. One prime example is the normal-state spin susceptibility \c{hi}spin: although its decrease upon cooling far above Tc typifies pseudogap behavior, its behavior at low temperatures is generally unknown. Here, our measurements in high magnetic fields expose \c{hi}spin of YBa2Cu3Oy down to low temperatures. Even though superconductivity is suppressed by the field, we uncover two thermally-activated contributions alongside a residual \c{hi}spin(T=0) due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range charge-density waves and to the formation of singlets as in certain quantum spin systems. Both phenomena thus contribute to the pseudogap at low temperature, supplementing short-lived antiferromagnetism that initiates pseudogap behavior at high temperatures. We therefore propose that the pseudogap ought to be regarded as a composite property and that, when not undergoing spin-stripe ordering, underdoped cuprates tend to form short-ranged spin singlets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. L. McLanahan, A. P. Ramirez</p>
            <p>Ferrimagnets in which half the spins are disordered and half ordered, so-called half-fire, half-ice state, have been advanced theoretically as a route towards realizing exotic magnetic ground states. Here we demonstrate novel single-spin resonance in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice material. Using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz we find a Debye-like resonance with Orbach relaxation temperature dependence, yielding an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. These quantities strongly suggest single-spin relaxation among paramagnetic Sm spins where the flipping field is provided by the FM-ordered Mn spins at domain boundaries, a direct outcome of the 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice state.</p>

            <h2>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Lyublinskaya, P. A. Nosov, I. S. Burmistrov</p>
            <p>Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state - a dark state - with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the long-wavelength and long-time dynamics of the fermion densities and analyze them numerically. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. We also estimate the minimum system sizes required to observe this instability in finite systems. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</p>

            <p>We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</p>

            <p>We measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect in an orthorhombic organic antiferromagnet $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl, which is a candidate for altermagnets. From the Maxwell equations, we obtained matrix-type general formulae describing the optical propagation and reflection for arbitrary crystals. These formulae enabled us to correctly measure and obtain the off-diagonal optical responses from the anisotropic organic crystal, which appeared at around the Néel temperature and exhibited a nonlinear field dependence in the antiferromagnetic phase. These results eliminate the net canted-magnetization origin. The obtained off-diagonal optical conductivity spectra for almost entire $\pi$-electron band clearly shows two spectral end-peaks due to magnetic origin with a large energy scale compared with the very small spin-orbit interaction, and proportionality to anisotropic diagonal conductivities possibly in relation to the piezomagnetic effect. These results suggest the altermagnetic response of this material. We also discuss the analogy between the magnetization in ferromagnets and Néel vector with respect to the magneto-optical configurations.</p>

            <p>Metals owe their unique mechanical properties to how defects emerge and propagate within their crystal structure under stress. However, the mechanisms leading from the early emerging (local) defects to the amplification of dislocations (collective plastic events) are not easy to track. Here, using tensile-stress atomistic simulations of a Copper lattice as a case study, we revisit this classical problem under a new perspective based on local dynamics rather than on purely structural arguments. We use a data-driven approach that allows tracking how local fluctuations emerge and accumulate in the atomic lattice in space and time, anticipating/determining the emergence of local or collective structural defects during deformation. Building solely on the general concepts of local fluctuations and spatiotemporal fluctuation correlations, this approach allows characterizing in a unique way the evolution through the elastic, plastic, and fracture phases, describing metals as complex systems where collective phenomena originate from local dynamical triggering events.</p>

BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~88 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</p>

Using Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.</p>

            <p>We study the relaxation of a diffusive particle confined in an arbitrary external potential and subject to a non-Markovian resetting protocol. With a constant rate $r$, a previous time $\tau$ between the initial time and the present time $t$ is chosen from a given probability distribution $K(\tau,t)$, and the particle is reset to the position that it occupied at time $\tau$. Depending on the shape of $K(\tau,t)$, the particle either relaxes toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution or toward a non-trivial stationary distribution that breaks ergodicity and depends on the initial position and the resetting protocol. From a general asymptotic theory, we find that if the kernel $K(\tau,t)$ is sufficiently localized near $\tau=0$, i.e., mostly the initial part of the trajectory is remembered and revisited, the steady state is non-Gibbs-Boltzmann. Conversely, if $K(\tau,t)$ decays slowly enough or increases with $\tau$, i.e., recent positions are more likely to be revisited, the probability distribution of the particle tends toward the Gibbs-Boltzmann state at large times. In the latter case, however, the temporal approach to the stationary state is generally anomalously slow, following for instance an inverse power law or a stretched exponential, if $K(\tau,t)$ is not too strongly peaked at the current time $t$. These findings are verified by the analysis of several exactly solvable cases and by numerical simulations.</p>

The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n ;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite sum \begin{equation}\label{R}\tag{A2} R(r;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2}, \end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We present an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\rm as)}(r;z\gg1)$ for the function $R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its logarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting oscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some threshold value $r^*$.

            <p>In this paper, we consider a renormalization group perspective on the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^N$ space through the complex landscape provided by a disordered Hamiltonian of type $2+p$. We focus on the large $N$ limit, where the coarse-graining procedure is unconventional: it is based on the Wigner spectrum of the rank-2 disorder. The main consequence of this choice is that canonical dimensions depend on the scale, and the flow equations fail to become autonomous, preventing the existence of global fixed points. One of the main features of the underlying renormalization group flow is the existence of finite-scale singularities for initial conditions sufficiently close to the Gaussian region and for rank-$p$ disorder intensity large enough. Using the Luttinger-Ward formalism, we show that these finite-scale singularities hide (and should be resolved by) a phase transition that breaks time-translation invariance.</p>

            <h2>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Ghafari Cherati, Anton Pershin, Ádám Gali</p>
            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <h2>The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs</h2>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyasu Koizumi</p>
            <p>Previously, we have shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions. We will demonstrate the importance of it in electron conduction problems in metals in this work. We first revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire connected to an electric battery. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that a sensible explanation is given if the generation of the current is due to the chemical potential gradient generated inside the wire by the battery connection. Next, we demonstrate its importance in the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation of the Josephson relation does not include the capacitor contribution inherently exists in the junction. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force explains the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals.</p>

The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties.

We find a very strong optical absorption band related to transitions between the filled V-$d_{xy}$ like states to the empty ones with strong polarization along the $a$-direction. We relate this to recent experimental observations of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a supression of the CL was observed upon addition of Li.</p>

            <h2>Influence of coupling symmetries and noise on the critical dynamics of synchronizing oscillator lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ricardo Gutierrez, Rodolfo Cuerno</p>
            <p>Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adil A. Gangat</p>
            <p>Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $<$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Wenyang Ding, Shouhang Li, Meng An, Gang Zhang</p>
            <p>As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.</p>

            <p>Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.</p>

            <p>Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.</p>

We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</p>

            <p>We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincaré 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.</p>

            <p>When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamical localization of discrete time evolution of topological split-step quantum random walk (QRW) on a single-site defect starting from a uniform distribution. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the high localization probability regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions contain two or more pairs of trapped states, forming near a lattice defect. By investigating the spectral properties of the discrete-time evolution operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial uniformly distributed state, thus offering a simple interpretation of the localization effect. As this localization scheme could be interpreted as a variation of spatial quantum search algorithm, we compare the localization probability and time with other types of two-dimensional quantum walks that do not have topological phases and realize localization time scaling similar to Grover's algorithm. Finally we show that mechanism of localization we identified is robust against the influence of disorder.</p>

            <p>Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory. We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsubasa Sakamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca, Aurora Basinski-Ferris, Laure Zanna, Ming Zhao</p>
            <p>Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</p>

Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows one to determine whether indeed aftershocks are present. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we find that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.</p>

            <p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI applications, understanding their inner workings is essential. In this work, we analyze the spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models through the lens of random matrix theory (RMT) to uncover learned structures. We find that certain regions of the weight matrix spectra deviate markedly from RMT predictions, indicating richer feature encoding. By comparing the corresponding singular vectors to eigenvectors of activation covariance matrices, we observe substantial overlap precisely where the spectra deviate from RMT expectations. Our analysis further reveals the important role of small singular values in LLMs, showing that these values contain significant information, a claim supported by increased perplexity when they are removed from the model. Although these small values may appear unimportant prior to task-specific fine-tuning, removing them afterward significantly degrades performance, revealing that fine-tuning refines the model primarily in these spectral regions. These results emphasize the critical role of small singular values, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.</p>

            <p>Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</p>

            <p>The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.</p>

Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</p>

            <h2>Terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons</h2>

            <p>We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.</p>

            <h2>Long-Lived Coherence between Incoherent Excitons revealed by Time-Resolved ARPES: An Exact Solution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenlin Zhang, Wei Hu, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>We investigate the exciton dynamics in an exactly solvable two-band model for semiconductors. The model incorporates light-matter, electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and captures exciton formation as well as the transition from the coherent to the incoherent regime. We analyze excitonic polarization, populations and coherences, with special focus on their impact in Time-Resolved and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). For nonresonant pumping with below-gap photon energies, TR-ARPES spectra reveal distinct excitonic replica and quantum beats persisting in the incoherent regime. These are due to a coherence between different species of {\em incoherent} excitons. Such type of coherence is resistant to phonon dephasing, indicating that it follows different dynamics than those governing the coherences considered so far.</p>

            <h2>Non-Reciprocal Current-Phase Relation and Superconducting Diode Effect in Topological-Insulator-Based Josephson Junctions</h2>

            <p>Josephson junctions (JJ) are essential for superconducting quantum technologies and searches of self-conjugate quasiparticles, pivotal for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity of Bad Fermions: Origin of Two Gaps in HTSC Cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E.A. Stepanov, S. Iskakov, M.I. Katsnelson, A.I. Lichtenstein</p>
            <p>We investigate the spectral properties of the doped ${t-t'}$ Hubbard model with parameters typical for high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Our approach is based on a novel strong-coupling Green's function expansion around a reference system -- the exactly solvable undoped particle-hole symmetric Hubbard lattice -- that possesses a large antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard-Slater gap in the electron spectrum. The electron spectral function in the case of a large next-nearest-neighbor hopping ${t'=-0.3t}$, which is characteristic of the ${T_c \approx 100\,\text{K}}$ family of cuprates, reveals a strongly renormalized flat band feature with a pseudogap around the antinodal point. The superconducting response of this system to a small ${d_{x^2-y^2}}$-like external field exhibits a very unusual form. It features a pseudogap at the antinodal point in the normal part of the Nambu Green's function, related to a ``bad-fermion'' behavior in a normal phase, as well as a ${d}$-wave-like structure in the anomalous (Gorkov's) Green's function, with zero response at the nodal point of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, we find that the anomalous part of the response deviates essentially from the simplest ${(\cos{k_x}-\cos{k_y})}$ form in momentum space. Specifically, its extrema are shifted away from the ${(\pi,0)}$ and ${(0,\pi)}$ points due to suppression of the response by the pseudogap. The observed two-gap structure of the electron spectra in a generic strong-coupling model of cuprates can serve as a basis for phenomenological treatment of different physical properties of high-temperature superconductors within two-fluid model.</p>

            <p>The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic structure was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phase as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic field-dependent pyroelectric current measurements revealed significantly higher magnetoelectric coupling at magnetic fields below 4 T than in pure TbMnO3. This is due to the higher sensitivity of the incommensurably modulated cycloid structure to weak magnetic fields. Detailed analysis of our data confirmed that the ferroelectric polarization is induced by inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for magnetic field strength up to 4 T, but at higher fields a departure from theoretical predictions is ascertained, giving evidence for an additional, as yet misunderstood, contribution to magnetoelectric coupling. It shows that a small 2% substitution of Mn3+ by Fe3+ has a strong impact on the magnetic structure, promoting the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T. We demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling magnitude can be tuned through suitable substitutional elements, even at low level, inducing local lattice distortions with different electronic and magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</h2>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We study the many-body localization problem in the non-abelian SU(2)-invariant random antiferromagnetic exchange model in 1D. Exact and sparse matrix diagonalization methods are used to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix. We investigate the behaviour of the energy level gap-ratio statistic, participation ratio, entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectral parameter as a function of disorder strength. Different distributions of random couplings are considered. We find, up to $L=24$, a clear distinction between our non-abelian model and the more often studied random field Heisenberg model: the regime of seemingly localized behaviour is much less pronounced in the random exchange model than in the field model case.</p>

            <p>The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance -- longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical kinetic energy quenching in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Borissov, Vladimir Calvera, Sung-Sik Lee</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of critical spin fluctuations and hot electrons at the metallic antiferromagnetic quantum critical points with $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ spin symmetries, building upon earlier works on the $O(3)$ symmetric theory. The interacting theories in $2+1$ dimensions are approached from $3+1$-dimensional theories in the $\epsilon$-expansion that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface as a control parameter. The low-energy physics of the $Z_2$ and $O(2)$ theories qualitatively differ from each other and also from that of the $O(3)$ theory. The difference is caused by higher-order quantum corrections beyond the one-loop order that are important even to the leading order in $\epsilon$. The naive loop-expansion breaks down due to dynamical quenching of kinetic energy: the speed of the collective mode ($c$) and the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ordering vector ($v$) become vanishingly small at low energies. What sets the three theories apart is the hierarchy that emerges between the quenched kinetic terms. At the infrared fixed point, $c/v$ becomes $0$, $1$ and $\infty$ in the $Z_2$, $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ theories, respectively. At intermediate energy scales, the slow renormalization group (RG) flows of $c$ and $v$ toward their fixed point values create approximate scale invariance controlled by approximate marginal parameters. The manifold of those quasi-fixed points and the RG flow therein determines crossovers from scaling behaviours with transient critical exponents at intermediate energy scales to the universal scaling in the low-energy limit. If the symmetry group is viewed as a tuning parameter, the $O(2)$ theory corresponds to a multi-critical point which has one additional quasi-marginal parameter than the other two theories.</p>

            <h2>Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-feng Yang</p>
            <p>The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and other multilayer nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.</p>

            <p>Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</p>

            <p>Moiré systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have attracted significant attention due to their ability to host correlated phenomena including superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating states. By defining the single-particle Green's function in the band basis, we systematically develop a many-body perturbation theory framework to address correlations beyond the usual mean-field Hartree-Fock approaches. As a specific example, we first analyze twisted bilayer graphene within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive analytical solutions for symmetry-breaking states at integer fillings and the finite-temperature metal-insulator transition that closely match previously known numerical results in the literature. Moving beyond Hartree-Fock, we incorporate self-consistent GW corrections demonstrating that first-order diagrams significantly overestimate the filling-dependent fluctuations in the electronic compressibility. This framework provides a comprehensive pathway for exploring strong electronic correlations in moiré systems beyond mean-field, giving new insights into the interplay of symmetry breaking and electron correlations.</p>

            <p>Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A phase-slip junction, the dual of a Josephson junction, provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Phase-slip junctions have been challenging, however, to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters. Here we demonstrate the operation of a superconducting qubit based on a phase slip junction made using titanium nitride. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (~17 GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes >60 $\mu$s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the phase-slip junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil S. Chellam, George C. Schatz</p>
            <p>Aluminum nanocrystals offer a promising platform for plasmonic photocatalysis, yet a detailed understanding of their electron dynamics and consequent photocatalytic performance has been challenging thus far due to computational limitations. Here, we employ density functional tight-binding methods (DFTB) to investigate the optical properties and H<sub>2</sub> dissociation dynamics of Al nanocrystals with varying sizes and geometries. Our real-time simulations reveal that Al's unique free-electron nature enables efficient light-matter interactions and rapid electronic thermalization. Cubic and octahedral nanocrystals ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 nm exhibit size-dependent plasmon resonances in the UV, with distinct spectral features arising from the particle geometry and electronic structure. By simulating H<sub>2</sub> dissociation near Al nanocrystals, we demonstrate that hot electrons generated through plasmon excitation can overcome the molecule's strong chemical bond within tens of femtoseconds. The laser intensity threshold is comparable to previous reports for Ag nanocrystals, though significantly lower than that of Au. Notably, the dipolar plasmon mode demonstrates higher efficiency for this reaction than the localized interband transition for particles at these sizes. Taken together, this work provides mechanistic insights into plasmon-driven catalysis and showcases DFTB's capability to study quantum plasmonics at unprecedented length and time scales.</p>

            <p>We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.</p>

            <p>We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of topological superconductivity in the presence of chiral magnetism in 2D CrInTe$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnob Mukherjee, Fengyi Zhou, Soheil Ershadrad, Tanay Nag, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>We propose a general framework for designing a two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductor (TSC) using a magnet-superconductor hybrid system. This setup involves a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, which hosts noncoplanar magnetic textures, in proximity to a 2D $s$-wave superconducting layer. Serving as an alternative to $p$-wave superconductors, this configuration induces a topological superconducting phase and is a promising platform for realizing the 2D Kitaev model, which supports Majorana zero-energy modes through emergent $p$-wave symmetry superconducting pairing. Notably, the magnetic moments break time-reversal symmetry while the superconducting state preserves particle-hole symmetry, placing our system in the Altland-Zirnbauer class $D$ and ensuring robust Majorana excitations. We first perform density functional theory-based simulations to study a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, from which essential magnetic characteristic parameters, such as Heisenberg exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), are calculated using the state-of-the-art Liechtenstein-Katsnelson-Antropov-Gubanov (LKAG) approach. With a substantial DMI coupling exhibited in CrInTe$_3$, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal the stabilization of a noncoplanar spiral magnetic state as ground state. In this magnetic phase, we observe a transition from corner modes in the zero-energy local density of states (LDOS) to edge modes as the chemical potential ($\mu$) varies. Furthermore, under a finite magnetic field, the system enters a mixed magnetic state, characterized by isolated skyrmions and spiral domain walls, which lead to unique low-energy localization of electronic wave functions, rendering the system an insulator. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations of TSC in this magnet-superconductor interfacial system, using real-space probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

            <h2>Topological superconductivity in hourglass Dirac chain metals (Ti, Hf)IrGe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavan Kumar Meena, Dibyendu Samanta, Sonika Jangid, Roshan Kumar Kushwaha, Rhea Stewart, Adrian D. Hillier, Sudeep Kumar Ghosh, Ravi Prakash Singh</p>
            <p>Realizing topological superconductivity in stoichiometric materials is a key challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, $M$IrGe ($M$ = Ti, Hf), as prime candidates for topological superconductivity, predicted to exhibit nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, we establish these materials as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in $M$IrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain- a ring of fourfold-degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states establishes $M$IrGe as a rare and robust platform to realize topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Cavity Vacuum and Emergent Gyrotropic Effects in Embedded moiré Superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zuzhang Lin, Hsun-Chi Chan, Wenqi Yang, Yixin Sha, Cong Xiao, Shuang Zhang, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>In an electronic system, spontaneous symmetry breaking can arise from many-body interaction between electrons, leading to degenerate ground states distinguishable by emergent effects otherwise prohibited by the symmetry. Here we show that ultrastrong coupling of a mesoscopic electronic system to the vacuum of a cavity resonator can lead to another paradigm of spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries in both systems. As a pertinent example, we consider the orbital gyrotropic effects in a moiré superlattice embedded in a THz split ring cavity resonator. Our mean-field and exact diagonalization calculations consistently demonstrate a spontaneous parity symmetry breaking in both the electronic ground state and the cavity vacuum, leading to two degenerate hybrid ground states distinguished by their opposite orbital gyrotropic Hall and magnetic effects. These sizable responses in the cavity-embedded moiré superlattice are highly tunable by both the cavity field polarization and interlayer bias on the moiré superlattice, providing an advanced platform for manipulating gyrotropic effects.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor-based Josephson junctions embedded within a Cooper-pair-box can host complex many-body states, such as interacting Andreev states and potentially other quasi-particles of topological origin. Here, we study the insights that could be revealed from a tomographic reconstruction of the Cooper-pair charge distribution of the junction prepared in its ground state. We posit that interacting and topological states can be identified from distinct signatures within the probability distribution of the charge states. Furthermore, the comprehensive dataset provides direct access to information theory metrics elucidating the entanglement between the charge sector of the superconductor and the microscopic degrees of freedom in the junction. We demonstrate how these metrics serve to further classify differences between the types of excitations in the junction.</p>

            <h2>Directly imaging spin polarons in a kinetically frustrated Hubbard system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max L. Prichard, Benjamin M. Spar, Ivan Morera, Eugene Demler, Zoe Z. Yan, Waseem S. Bakr</p>
            <p>The emergence of quasiparticles in quantum many-body systems underlies the rich phenomenology in many strongly interacting materials. In the context of doped Mott insulators, magnetic polarons are quasiparticles that usually arise from an interplay between the kinetic energy of doped charge carriers and superexchange spin interactions. However, in kinetically frustrated lattices, itinerant spin polarons - bound states of a dopant and a spin-flip - have been theoretically predicted even in the absence of superexchange coupling. Despite their important role in the theory of kinetic magnetism, a microscopic observation of these polarons is lacking. Here we directly image itinerant spin polarons in a triangular lattice Hubbard system realised with ultracold atoms, revealing enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations in the local environment of a hole dopant. In contrast, around a charge dopant, we find ferromagnetic correlations, a manifestation of the elusive Nagaoka effect. We study the evolution of these correlations with interactions and doping, and use higher-order correlation functions to further elucidate the relative contributions of superexchange and kinetic mechanisms. The robustness of itinerant spin polarons at high temperature paves the way for exploring potential mechanisms for hole pairing and superconductivity in frustrated systems. Furthermore, our work provides microscopic insights into related phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huizi Xie, Sirui Yu, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin</p>
            <p>In this work we revisit the problem of a Majorana box qubit (MBQ) readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the MBQ are associated with the combined fermion parities of the MBQ and its tunnel-coupled quantum dot, which is measured by a PC detector. Beyond the existing studies on limiting bias voltage regimes, we analyze the steady-state current and the current power spectrum across all bias voltages. Our results indicate that the MBQ readout via the parity-dependent detector current is effective only at low bias voltage regime and requires the dot energy level to be off-resonance with the Majorana qubit. In contrast, the current power spectrum allows MBQ readout through the parity-dependent Rabi oscillation peak signals for arbitrary bias voltages, without restrictions on the dot energy level. Particularly, with focus on the MBQ measurement visibility, we analyze the peak-to-pedestal ratio for each characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. By examining these two metrics, we identify the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.</p>

            <h2>Mapping Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions to inversion asymmetry in perovskite oxide heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nirmal Ganguli, Avishek Singh, Vivek Kumar, Jayita Chakraborty</p>
            <p>Inversion asymmetry, combined with spin-orbit interaction, leads to Rashba or Dresselhaus effects, or combinations of them that are promising for technologies based on antiferromagnetic spintronics. Since understanding the exact nature of spin-orbit interaction is crucial for developing a technology based on it, mapping the nature of inversion asymmetry with the type of spin-orbit interaction becomes the key. We simulate a perovskite oxide heterostructure LaAlO$_3|$SrIrO$_3|$SrTiO$_3$ preserving the inversion symmetry within density functional theory to demonstrate the relation between the nature of inversion asymmetry and the corresponding Rashba or Dresselhaus-type interaction. With progressive distortion in the heterostructure, we find how the structure inversion asymmetry sets in with distorted bond lengths and bond angles, leading to Rashba effect in the system. Further, introduction of tilted IrO$_6$ octahedra leads to bulk inversion asymmetry, helping a combined Rashba-Dresselhaus interaction to set in. A comparison of the spin textures obtained from our DFT calculations and theoretical modeling helps us identify the exact nature of the interactions. Besides demonstrating the connection between the nature of asymmetry with Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, our work may serve as a guide to identifying different types of Rashba-like spin-orbit interactions.</p>

            <h2>Effective grand-canonical description of condensation in negative-temperature regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Iubini, Antonio Politi</p>
            <p>The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand-canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable and their lifetime $\tau$ is exponentially long with the temperature, $\tau \approx \exp(\lambda |T|)$ (for $T<0$). A general expression for $\lambda$ is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of non-interacting particles. In the DNLS model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant, makes $\lambda$ even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.</p>

            <h2>Strain stiffening due to stretching of entangled particles in random packings of granular materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Brown, Kevin A. Mitchell, Alice Nasto, Athanasios Athanassiadis, Heinrich M. Jaeger</p>
            <p>Stress-strain relations for random packings of entangling chains under triaxial compression can exhibit strain stiffening and sustain stresses several orders-of-magnitude beyond typical granular materials. X-ray tomography reveals the transition to this strong strain stiffening occurs when chains are long enough to entangle an average of about one chain each, which results in system-filling clusters of entangled chains. The number of entanglements is nearly proportional to the area surrounded by entangling particles with an excluded volume effect. A tendency was found for chain links to stretch when the packing was strained. The slope of the stress-strain relation of the packing can be calculated from a mean-field model consisting of the product of the effective extensional modulus of the chain, packing fraction, probability of stretched links, and the ratio of strain of stretched links to packing strain. The stress-strain model requires as input measurements of the ratio between local particle deformation and global average strain, and the probability of stretching for non-rigid particles. This results in a quadratic prediction for the stress-strain curve, with a curvature that agrees with experiments within the model uncertainties. This model explains that the strength of these packings comes from stretching of the links of chains, but only when the system-filling network of entanglements provides constraints that prevents failure by shear banding, so that particles must be deformed to move further under strain. In this model, the increasing slope of the stress-strain curve is mainly due to the fraction of stretched links increasing with strain. This model for the stress-strain relation is shown to be generalizable to different shapes of entangling particles by applying it to staples.</p>

            <h2>Quantum loops in the 1T transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashland Knowles, G. Baskaran, R. Ganesh</p>
            <p>Loop arrangements and their quantum superpositions describe several interesting many-particle states. We propose that they also describe bonding in a class of transition metal dichalcogenides. We present an effective quantum loop model for monolayers with 1T structure and a d$^2$ valence electron configuration: materials of the form MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te) and AM$'$Y$_2$ (A = Li, Na; M$'$ = V, Nb and Y = O, S, Se). Their t$_{2g}$ orbitals exhibit strongly directional overlaps between neighbouring atoms, favouring the formation of valence bonds. A transition metal atom forms two valence bonds, each with one of its neighbours. When connected, these bonds form loops that cover the triangular lattice. We construct a minimal Rokhsar-Kivelson-like model with resonance processes that cut and reconnect loops that run in proximity. The resulting dynamics is more constrained than in traditional quantum dimer models, with a `bending' constraint that arises from orbital structure. In the resulting phase diagram, we find phases that resemble distorted phases seen in materials, viz., the 1T$'$ and trimerized phases. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single d$^1$ or d$^3$ impurity will terminate a loop and give rise to a long-ranged texture. For example, a Ti/Cr defect in LiVO$_2$ will produce one or more domain walls that propagate outward from the impurity. We discuss the possibility of a loop liquid phase that can emerge in these materials.</p>

            <h2>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgia Marcelli, Tecla Bottinelli Montandon, Roya Ebrahimi Viand, Felix Höfling</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</p>

The invention of periodic poling revolutionized nonlinear optics and its commercial applications by enabling robust quasi-phase-matching in crystals such as lithium niobate. However, reaching useful frequency conversion efficiencies requires macroscopic dimensions, limiting further technology development and integration. Here we realize a periodically poled van der Waals semiconductor (3R-MoS$_2$). Due to its exceptional nonlinearity, we achieve macroscopic frequency conversion efficiency of 0.03% at the relevant telecom wavelength over a microscopic thickness of 3.4${\mu}$m (that is, 3 poling periods), $10-100\times$ thinner than current systems with similar performances. Due to unique intrinsic cavity effects, the thickness-dependent quasi-phase-matched second harmonic signal surpasses the usual quadratic enhancement by $50\%$. Further, we report the broadband generation of photon pairs at telecom wavelengths via quasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion, showing a maximum coincidence-to-accidental-ratio of $638 \pm 75$. This work opens the new and unexplored field of phase-matched nonlinear optics with microscopic van der Waals crystals, unlocking applications that require simple, ultra-compact technologies such as on-chip entangled photon-pair sources for integrated quantum circuitry and sensing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duyu Chen, Rhine Samajdar, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.</p>

            <p>Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.</p>

            <p>Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information applications, owing to their efficient and bright single photon emission. Despite the challenges in directly characterizing these emitters, the interaction between external fields and defects, such as the Stark shift, offers valuable insights into their local geometric configurations. In this study, we focus on clarifying the possible origin of the distinct Stark shift characteristics observed experimentally, particularly in the emission range around 2 eV. We find that the local symmetry of the defects plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the Stark shift, which can be either linear or quadratic. Additionally, the local dielectric environment significantly influences the Stark shift response. Our calculations not only enhance the understanding of the micro-structure of these hitherto unknown emitters but also pave the way for their more effective utilization as single-photon sources and qubits in quantum technologies.</p>

In this work, we experimentally measure the optical response of high-quality monolayer TMD heterostructures and compare the results with the different theoretical models to address this uncertainty. We find that in high-quality heterostructures, quantum mechanical interactions in the form of pure dephasing plays a dominant role, which has been challenging to isolate experimentally in previous studies. Furthermore, accounting for an additional decay rate to the commonly used radiative and non-radiative rates is found to be important for the accurate description of the excitonic response. These findings establish a robust framework for understanding and predicting the optical properties of TMD-based heterostructures, crucial for both fundamental research and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Presence of excitons significantly influence the optoelectronic properties and potential applications of materials. Using combined theoretical and experimental tools, we investigate the absorption spectra of $d^0$ double perovskite oxides Ba$_{2}$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Nb, Ta, Sb), Ba$_{2}$Sc$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Ta, Sb) and $A_{2}$ScSbO$_6$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba), allowing for a systematic variation of composition. We not only show that low-energy excitons are present in the visible range in {\it all} the considered so-called wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these exciton modes differ from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a detailed and comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Further, our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.</p>

The resulting non-equilibrium steady-state transports entropy between the current and the heat bath, without need of any thermodynamic force. In the limit of strong magnetic field, both the entropy production rate and the fluctuation of entropy transport become vanishingly small, whereas the average rate of entropy transport remains finite.

            <h2>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</p>

The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with numerically-obtained values with the exciton-reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $4.6$ meV. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with the low losses and the sub-wavelength light confinement, could pave the way towards single-photon nonlinearities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Rottoli, Michele Mazzoni, Fabio Sailis, Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo</p>
            <p>In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</p>

Efficiently simulating the quantum-classical electronic interface is hence of paramount importance.

Our models are capable of faithfully reproducing coherent quantum behavior within a standard electronic circuit simulator, enabling compromise-free co-simulation of hybrid quantum devices. In particular, we present results from co-simulations performed in Cadence Spectre, showcasing coherent quantum phenomena in circuits with both quantum and classical components using an industry-standard electronic design and automation tool. Our work paves the way for a new paradigm in the design of quantum systems, which leverages the many decades of development of electronic computer-aided design and automation tools in the semiconductor industry to now simulate and optimize quantum processing units, quantum-classical interfaces, and hybrid quantum-analog circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bor Kavčič, Gašper Tkačik</p>
            <p>We consider a family of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs), consisting of particles on a lattice that require binding by a "token" in various physical configurations to advance over the lattice. Using a combination of theory and simulations, we address the following questions: (i) How token binding kinetics affects the current-density relation on the lattice; (ii) How this current-density relation depends on the scarcity of tokens; (iii) How tokens propagate the effects of the locally-imposed disorder (such as a slow site) over the entire lattice; (iv) How a shared pool of tokens couples concurrent TASEPs running on multiple lattices; (v) How our results translate to TASEPs with open boundaries that exchange particles with the reservoir. Since real particle motion (including in biological systems that inspired the standard TASEP model, e.g., protein synthesis or movement of molecular motors) is often catalyzed, regulated, actuated, or otherwise mediated, the token-driven TASEP dynamics analyzed in this paper should allow for a better understanding of real systems and enable a closer match between TASEP theory and experimental observations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Albert M. Varonov</p>
            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</p>

            <p>The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental prerequisite of these exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity, nematic order, and checkerboard charge order. Here we explore the filling-dependent multiple stable intertwined electronic and atomic orders of flat-band state of 1T-TaS2 encompassing hole order, phase orders, coexisting left- and right-chiral orders and mixed phase/chiral orders via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Combining first-principles calculations, the emergent electronic/atomic orders can be attributed to the weakening of electron-electron correlations and stacking-dependent interlayer interactions. Moreover, achiral intermediate ring-like clusters and nematic charge density wave (CDW) states are successfully realized in intralayer chiral domain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions through chiral overlap configurations. Our study not only deepens the understanding of filling-dependent electronic/atomic orders in flat-band systems, but also offers perspectives for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated electronic systems.</p>

            <p>Cells not only can be motile by crawling but are also capable of non-motility active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayer.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide (BA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$ and phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide (PEA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$. By examining the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations, as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant correlations with the same. Additionally, we observed photoluminescence emission peak splitting for both systems, which becomes prominent above certain critical temperatures where the suppression of PLQY begins. This study suggests that the rotational motions of polarized molecules may lead to a reduction in exciton binding energy or the breaking of degeneracy in exciton binding energy levels, enhancing non-radiative recombination rates, and consequently reducing photoluminescence yield. These findings offer a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions in 2D HOIPs and could guide the design of more efficient light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.</p>

After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</p>

            <p>Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</p>

            <p>Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the spin-charge current conversion characteristics of chemically disordered ferromagnetic single FePt thin films by spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance experiments performed on both a resonance cavity and on patterned devices. We clearly observe a self-induced signal in a single FePt layer. The sign of a single FePt spin pumping voltage signal is consistent with a typical bilayer with a positive spin Hall angle layer such as that of Pt on top of a ferromagnet (FM), substrate//FM/Pt. Structural analysis shows a strong composition gradient due to natural oxidation at both FePt interfaces, with the Si substrate and with the air. The FePt-thickness dependence of the self-induced charge current produced allowed us to obtain $\lambda _ \text{FePt}=(1.5\pm 0.1)$ nm and self-induced $\theta_ \text{self-FePt}=0.047 \pm 0.003$, with efficiency for reciprocal effects applications $\theta _ \text{self-FePt} \times \lambda _ \text{FePt} = 0.071$ nm which is comparable to that of Pt, $\theta _ \text{SH-Pt} \times \lambda _ \text{Pt} = 0.2$ nm. Moreover, by studying bilayer systems such as Si//FePt/Pt and Si//Pt//FePt we independently could extract the individual contributions of the external inverse spin Hall effect of Pt and the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect of FePt. Notably, this method gives consistent values of charge currents produced due to only self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in FePt layers. These results advance our understanding of spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms in composite thin films and pave the way for the development of next-generation spintronics devices based on self-torque.</p>

            <p>A simple three-dimensional model of a fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials as far as the intercluster structure is concerned.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuations of dynamical observables in linear diffusions with time delay: a Riccati-based approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.L. Rosinberg, G. Tarjus, T. Munakata</p>
            <p>Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mykhailo V. Rakov, Luca Tagliacozzo, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Titas Chanda</p>
            <p>We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</p>

            <h2>Time evolution of the local density of states of strongly correlated fermions coupled to a nanoprobe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Blum, Reinhard M. Noack, Salvatore R. Manmana</p>
            <p>We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Generation and Stabilization by Coherent Collisions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Mert Bozkurt, Rosa López, Sungguen Ryu</p>
            <p>Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</p>

            <h2>Berry curvature and shift vector effects at high-order wave mixing in biased bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H.K. Avetissian, H.H. Matevosyan, G.F. Mkrtchian</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a microscopic quantum theory that elucidates the nonlinear and nonperturbative optical response of biased bilayer graphene subjected to bichromatic strong laser fields. This response is analyzed using a four-band Hamiltonian derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations. For the laser-stimulated dynamics, we employ structure gauge-invariant evolutionary equations to accurately describe the evolution of the single-particle density matrix across the entire Brillouin zone. The resonant generation of electron-hole pairs by the high-frequency component of the field, combined with the induction of high-order harmonic generation and high-order wave mixing by the strong low-frequency field component, leads to significant alterations in the resulting spectra. These changes are driven by the effects of Berry curvature and the shift vector, which modify the relative contributions of interband and intraband channels, thereby fundamentally reshaping the radiation spectra at high-order frequency multiplication. The numerical results are further supported by approximate analytical calculations, demonstrating that high-order wave mixing can be modeled using the classical trajectory analysis of electron-hole pairs, with Berry curvature and the shift vector significantly influencing the saddle-point equations.</p>

Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</p>

            <p>As a promising candidate for altermagnet, CrSb possesses a distinctive compensated spin split band structure that could bring groundbreaking concepts to the field of spintronics. In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. After careful analysis of the transport data, we conclude the non-linearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal, with the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have successfully reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.</p>

            <h2>Transverse voltage in anisotropic hydrodynamic conductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaize Wang, Chunyu Guo, Philip J.W. Moll, Tobias Holder</p>
            <p>Weak momentum dissipation in ultra-clean metals gives rise to novel non-Ohmic current flow, including ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes. Recently, hydrodynamic flow has attracted intense interest because it presents a valuable window into the electronic correlations and the longest lived collective modes of quantum materials. However, diagnosing viscous flow is difficult as the macroscopic observables of ballistic and hydrodynamic transport such as the average current distribution can be deceptively similar, even if their respective microscopics deviate notably. Based on kinetic Boltzmann theory, here we propose to address this issue via the transverse channel voltage at zero magnetic field, which can efficiently detect hydrodynamic flow in a number of materials. To this end, we show that the transverse voltage is sensitive to the interplay between anisotropic fermiology and boundary scattering, resulting in a non-trivial behavior in narrow channels along crystalline low-symmetry directions. We discuss several materials where the channel-size dependent stress of the quantum fluid leads to a characteristic sign change of the transverse voltage as a new hallmark of the cross-over from the ballistic to the hydrodynamic regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</p>

            <p>We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</p>

The heat capacity, magnetization and NMR relaxation times of the $^{3}$He were measured over a wide temperature range from 200 $\mu$K to 500 mK. They provide evidence for changes in the ground state in the second layer film as the amount of $^{4}$He is increased at various fixed $^{3}$He doses. Clear evidence is obtained for a solid second layer film, matching the r\a'egime of superfluid response previously observed in pure $^{4}$He films.</p>

We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuta Sekino, Yuya Ominato, Hiroyuki Tajima, Shun Uchino, Mamoru Matsuo</p>
            <p>We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <p>Maximum entropy methods, based on the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, are essential for modeling interactions between pairs of variables in data-driven problems across disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their considerable success, these methods typically fail to capture higher-order interactions that are often essential for understanding complex systems. Conversely, modern machine learning methods capture these complex interactions, but the computational cost of interpretable frameworks makes them impractical for real-world applications. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient way to capture statistical correlations using hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. In this study, we introduce a new method that maps RBMs to generalized Potts models, allowing for the extraction of interactions up to any specified order. This method utilizes large-$N$ approximations, enabled by the RBM's simple structure, to extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. Furthermore, we propose a robust framework for extracting higher-order interactions in more complex probabilistic models and a simple gauge-fixing method within the effective many-body Potts model. Our validation on synthetic datasets confirms the method's ability to recover two- and three-body interactions accurately. When applied to protein sequence data, the framework competently reconstructs protein contact maps and provides performance comparable to the best inverse Potts models. These findings confirm that RBMs are an effective and streamlined tool for exploring higher-order interactions within complex systems.</p>

            <h2>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ezequiel E. Ferrero, Eduardo A. Jagla</p>
            <p>Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0<\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</p>

            <p>A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.</p>

            <p>The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</p>

            <p>Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</p>

            <h2>Probing spectral features of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinzhao Sun, Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Vlatko Vedral, Andrew T. Boothroyd, M. S. Kim</p>
            <p>The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum circuits with free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balázs Pozsgay, Kohei Fukai</p>
            <p>Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</p>

            <h2>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata</p>
            <p>Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Bachtis, Giulio Biroli, Aurélien Decelle, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Pathak</p>
            <p>Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts radiating at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts radiating, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux exhibits oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room- or higher-temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.</p>

            <p>The mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. Also, we have performed synchrotron-based high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the compressibility properties of this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, of three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine relative to terrestrial olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite. The origin of the observed differences is discussed. A simple model combining the results of both our nanoindentation and HP-XRD measurements allows us to describe the contribution of macroscopic and chemical-bond related effects, both of which are necessary to reproduce the observed elastic modulus softening. Such joint analysis of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue for characterizing these highly interesting materials.</p>

            <p>In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro</p>
            <p>Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</p>

            <h2>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lebedev-Stepanov</p>
            <p>The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski (HR) formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. In this paper, the Navier condition is applied to the liquid-liquid boundary for the first time. A generalized HR equation is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the usual HR equation. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids. For infinite viscosity of the drop, it becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Fallas Padilla, Visal So, Abhishek Menon, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Guido Pagano</p>
            <p>The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</p>

            <h2>Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. However, extracting universal dynamical features requires resolving correlations at both low energy and momentum. Here, we introduce nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a novel and powerful quantum sensing platform of superconducting materials. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach by probing several low-energy phenomena in high-$T_c$ cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) -- gapless quasiparticle excitations, critical fluctuations at the metal-superconductor transition and kinetics of vortices. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we find a sharp reduction in the NV relaxation time ($T_1$) near the critical temperature $T_c\approx90~$K, attributed to supercurrent-fluctuation induced magnetic noise. Crucially, the temperature-scaling of the noise near criticality deviates from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field prediction and reflects critical order parameter fluctuations, allowing us to determine both static and dynamical critical exponents for the transition. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of $T_1$ near $T_c$, indicating significant field-induced smearing of the transition. By analyzing the scaling of the BSCCO-induced relaxation rate with the field strength, we unveil evidence in favor of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, deep inside the superconducting phase, we employ NV decoherence ($T_2$) spectroscopy to observe strong magnetic fluctuations in the low-frequency regime, suggesting the presence of complex vortex-solid fluctuations. Our results establish NV-based noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</p>

However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field.

A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.</p>

            <p>While extensively studied in normal metals, semimetals and semiconductors, the superconducting (SC) proximity effect remains elusive in the emerging field of flat-band systems. In this study we probe proximity-induced superconductivity in Josephson junctions (JJs) formed between superconducting NbTiN electrodes and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) weak links. Here the TBG acts as a highly tunable topological flat-band system, which due to its twist-angle dependent bandwidth, allows to probe the SC proximity effect at the crossover from the dispersive to the flat-band limit. Contrary to our original expectations, we find that the SC remains strong even in the flat-band limit, and gives rise to broad, dome shaped SC regions, in the filling dependent phase diagram. In addition, we find that unlike in conventional JJs, the critical current Ic strongly deviates from a scaling with the normal state conductance GN. We attribute these findings to the onset of strong electron interactions, which can give rise to an excess critical current, and also work out the potential importance of quantum geometric terms as well as multiband pairing mechanisms. Our results present the first detailed study of the SC proximity effect in the flat-band limit and shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the formation of SC domes in flat-band systems.</p>

            <p>Optical orientation of exciton and carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the basic phenomenon in the spin physics of semiconductors. Here, we investigate spin orientation in MAPbI3 lead halide perovskite crystals at the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K, where the material has an orthorhombic crystal structure. The recombination and spin dynamics of excitons and carriers are measured by time-resolved photoluminescence after circularly polarized excitation. The optical orientation of excitons reaches 85\%, which persists within their lifetime of 15-80 ps. This high orientation is maintained for excitation laser detunings from the exciton resonance to higher energies by up to 0.3 eV, then decreases and vanishes above 1.5 eV detuning. This indicates that the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism based on inversion symmetry breaking is inactive in MAPbI3 crystals with orthorhombic symmetry. The optical orientation of localized and spatially-separated electrons and holes results in 40\% circular polarization of their emission. Their contributions can be identified from the complex spin beats dynamics in transverse magnetic field. The dynamics analysis gives values of the Landé g-factors of 2.83 for electrons and 0.54 for holes. Also, the magnetic-field-induced polarization of excitons and carriers is analyzed in magnetic fields up to 6 T, showing that their spin relaxation times are longer than their lifetimes. Namely, for the excitons, the spin relaxation time exceeds the lifetime by a factor of 6. We model the dynamics of optical orientation degree for cumulative contributions of excitons and carriers and show that the exciton recombination dynamics can control these dynamics. The polarized emission of excitons and localized carriers, produced by their polarization on Zeeman-split levels in magnetic fields, is modeled.</p>

            <p>Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Ming Xie, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Ionic Liquid Affinity and Its Effect on Phospholipid Membrane Structure and Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. K. Sharma, J. Gupta, H. Srinivasan, P. Hitaishi, S. K. Ghosh, S. Mitra</p>
            <p>In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.</p>
