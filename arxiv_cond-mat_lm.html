            <h2>Static and dynamic ordering of magnetic repelling particles under confinement: disks vs bars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Aguilar-González, L. F. Elizondo-Aguilera, Y.D. Sobral, F. Pacheco-Vázquez</p>
            <p>We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression dynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two particle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the non-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are observed for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and pressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by considering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between particles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed during compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering, bars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force chains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises continuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip motion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with inter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the reduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable features in designing magnetic granular dampers.</p>

            <h2>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.</p>

            <h2>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Ataç İmamoğlu, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thibault Charpentier, Anton Khvalyuk, Lev Ioffe, Mikhail Feigel'man, Nicolas Roch, Benjamin Sacépé</p>
            <p>Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Counterflow leads to roton spectra in locally interacting superfluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin, Eddy Timmermans</p>
            <p>The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled nonlinear-Schrödinger equations.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatically Assembled Open Square and Checkerboard Superlattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Binay P. Nayak, Wenjie Wang, Honghu Zhang, Benjamin M. Ocko, Alex Travesset, Surya K. Mallapragada, David Vaknin</p>
            <p>Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling spin Hall effect induced by unconventional $p$-wave magnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Zeng</p>
            <p>We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the $p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum metric-based optical selection rules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongpan Li, Cheng-Cheng Liu</p>
            <p>The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yedi Shen, Sanyi You, Zhenhua Qiao, Qian Niu</p>
            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Chen, Mingbo Dou, Qin Zhang, Xianjie Wang, M. Ye. Zhuravlev, A. V. Nikolaev, L. L. Tao</p>
            <p>The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results. Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and quantum geometry.</p>

            <h2>Perfect Superconducting Diode and Supercurrent Range Controller</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>Diodes have a nonreciprocal voltage versus current relationship, produced by breaking the space and time reversal symmetry. However, developing high-end superconducting computers requires a superconducting analogue of the traditional semiconductor diode. Such a superconducting diode exhibits non-reciprocity, or a high asymmetry in its critical currents. We present a model of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum interference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires (MW-SQUID). The superconducting condensate in the nanowires is assumed to obey a linear current-phase relationship (CPR). The diode predicted by our model has a large positive critical current, while the negative critical current can be made exactly zero. Thus achieved 100\% diode efficiency ($\eta = 1$) remains stable against small changes of the magnetic field. Another important result is that under certain and quite broad conditions such devices can act as supercurrent range controllers. In such device a supercurrent can flow with zero voltage applied, but only if the supercurrent is contained in some narrow, adjustable range, which excludes zero current.</p>

            <h2>Magnon-induced transparency of a disordered antiferromagnetic Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. G. Mal'shukov</p>
            <p>We considered a planar Josephson junction which is composed of two s-wave superconducting contacts deposited on the top of a thin antiferromagnetic (AFM) disordered metal film. In such a system noticeable Josephson currents may be observed, if contacts are just nanometers away from each other. It is shown that the excitation of AFM by magnons results in a strong enhancement of the stationary current through much longer junctions, whose length may be comparable to the coherence length of superconducting correlations in a nonmagnetic metal. Such a current is calculated at the weak tunneling amplitude of electrons between superconducting contacts and AFM. The problem is considered for nonequilibrium Green functions in the second-order perturbation theory with respect to the electron-magnon interaction. A spin-orbit torque oscillator was taken as a possible source of long-wavelength classic magnetic waves. This work predicts a strong effect of magnons on superconducting proximity effect in AFM, with promising applications in superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Altermagnetism in Antiferromagnetic 2D Films via Adsorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Liu, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Yu-Jun Zhao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify 63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3 selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum interference among vortex bound states in superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ming Fu, Da Wang, Qiang-Hua Wang</p>
            <p>In a recent experiment (Hou et al Phys. Rev. X 15, 011027), a new type of necklace-like vortex bound state (VBS) was observed and attributed to disorder induced interference among different Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states within one single vortex. In this work, we further investigate the possibilities of quantum interference among the CdGM states from different vortices in clean superconductors, which may become significant near the upper critical field. We find a series of interference patterns in the local density of states (LDOS) due to the overlap between spatially separated individual CdGM states. On a vortex lattice, the interference can also lead to a necklace-like LDOS, hence, providing an alternative and intrinsic mechanism to observe the novel necklace-like, or other spatially modulated VBS more generally, in experiments. These results can be understood quite well within an effective tight-binding model constructed from the individual CdGM states, and can be checked in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Bi-doped copper (Cu1-xBix) nanowires (NWs), promising candidates for spintronic applications due to their potential for a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), were synthesized and their structural properties and thermal stability were investigated. Using template-assisted electrodeposition, Cu1-xBix nanowires with varying bismuth (Bi) content (x=0, 2, 4, and 7%) and different crystalline domain sizes were fabricated. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in the grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. While NWs with larger crystalline domains allow homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, NWs with smaller crystalline domains exhibit noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability of the NWs was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering. Upon heating, lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice were observed, with subsequent crystallization of rhombohedral metallic Bi upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the SHE performance of Cu1-xBix nanowires for spintronic devices by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.</p>

            <h2>How to Fix Silver for Plasmonics</h2>

            <p>Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the visible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use is limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally evaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a simple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the chemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal co-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents ranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite structure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that low Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin films (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to oxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic wetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass. Among the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest chemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and excellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas that exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach provides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic device applications.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive study of gas leakage at interfaces based on Persson contact mechanics theory. A prototype syringe system consisting of a rubber stopper and a glass barrel is selected, where surface roughness is characterized using measurements from stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy, and contact pressure distributions are obtained from Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations. Leakage prediction is performed using Multiscale Contact Mechanics (MCM) software. The predicted results show good agreement with experimental measurements under controlled dry conditions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that small variations in elastic modulus and contact pressure can significantly influence leakage, particularly near the percolation threshold. This work provides a generalized and validated framework for leakage prediction and offers practical guidance for the design of sealing systems in pharmaceutical and engineering applications.</p>

We have also developed a rather simple generalized mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT this http URL evolution of the Fermi surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more conventional square lattice.</p>

            <p>A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory. Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays. Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions, emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Susheel Kumar, Krishnacharya Khare, Manjesh K. Singh</p>
            <p>Adhesion control at the interface of two surfaces is crucial in various applications, including the design of micro- and nanodevices such as microfluidic devices, triboelectric nanogenerators, biochips, and electronic sensors. Several factors influence adhesion, including sample preparation, surface energy, mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity, and surface texture or roughness. This study specifically investigates the effect of surface roughness on the adhesion behavior of the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), focusing on a complementary interface with identical roughness. To create surface roughness, sandpapers with grit sizes ranging from N = 120 to N = 2000 were used during the molding process. The surface roughness of the PDMS elastomer was then characterized using a stylus profilometer. Interfacial adhesion was evaluated through wedge test experiments, which enabled the analysis of the relationship between surface roughness, work of adhesion, and equilibrium crack length. Furthermore, the study also explores the correlation between the real area of contact and the work of adhesion.</p>

            <h2>On-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD to design new routes from glassy carbon to quenchable amorphous diamond with low pressure and temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng-Qi Cheng, Wei-Dong Luo, Hong Sun</p>
            <p>Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.</p>

This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the $\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface. The discovery of a robust, surface-confined spiral paves the way for engineering energy-efficient, nanoscale spin-texture platforms for next-generation devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deep Mondal, Sujoy Datta, Debnarayan Jana</p>
            <p>Carbon nitride research has reached a promising point in today's research endeavours with diverse applications including photocatalysis, energy storage, and sensing due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for exploring and optimizing the potential of these materials. This study presents a comprehensive review of the integration of ML techniques in carbon nitride research with an introduction to CN classifications and recent advancements. We discuss the methodologies employed, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, in predicting material properties, optimizing synthesis conditions, and enhancing performance metrics. Key findings indicate that ML algorithms can significantly reduce experimental trial-and-error, accelerate discovery processes, and provide deeper insights into the structure-property relationships of carbon nitride. The synergistic effect of combining ML with traditional experimental approaches is highlighted, showcasing studies where ML driven models have successfully predicted novel carbon nitride compositions with enhanced functional properties. Future directions in this field are also proposed, emphasizing the need for high-quality datasets, advanced ML models, and interdisciplinary collaborations to fully realize the potential of carbon nitride materials in next-generation technologies.</p>

            <h2>Bulk Ferroelectric Heterostructures for High Temperature Lead-Free Piezoelectrics</h2>

            <p>Remarkable exploitation of valence and lattice mismatch in epitaxial ferroelectric heterostructures generates physical effects not classically expected for perovskite oxides, such as 2D electron gas and polar skyrmions. However the widespread application of these interfacial properties and functionalities is impeded by the ultrathin layered structure and essential presence of underlying lattice-matched substrates for the deposition of epitaxial thin films. Here, we report a bottom-up pathway to synthesize bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (BFH) with periodic composition fluctuation (8 nm in wavelength) using elemental partitioning by cation diffusion, providing opportunities to exploit novel characteristics of hetero-epitaxial oxide thin films in bulk materials. Exemplar monolithic BiFeO3-BaTiO3 BFH ceramics described herein share common features with their thin film heterostructure counterparts, which facilitates control and stabilisation of ferroelectric polarisation along with a significant enhancement in Curie temperature, Tc, and functionality. BFH ceramics exhibit a record Tc (up to 824 °C) and a piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 115 pC N-1 ), in comparison with other perovskite or non-perovskite solid solutions, providing sustainable solutions for emergent high temperature piezoelectric sensing, actuation and energy conversion applications. By creating BFH ceramics using different electromechanical boundary conditions, distinct morphologies of aliovalent A-site cation segregated regions along with different types of ferroelectric order are achieved. This formation mechanism provides unprecedented control over local ferroelectric ordering and domain stabilisation in BFH ceramics; it also paves the way to explore new types of functionality, beyond those achievable in both bulk ferroelectrics and thin film heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beau Leighton-Trudel</p>
            <p>The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.</p>

            <h2>Distinct Uniaxial Stress and Pressure Fingerprint of Superconductivity in the 3D Kagome Lattice Compound CeRu2</h2>

            <p>The exploration of tunable superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems is a central pursuit in condensed matter physics, with implications for both fundamental understanding and potential applications. The Laves phase CeRu$_{2}$, a pyrochlore compound, exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) Kagome lattice type geometry giving rise to flat bands and degenerate Dirac points, where band structure features intertwine with strong multi-orbital interaction effects deriving from its correlated electronic structure. Here, we combine muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), uniaxial in-plane stress, and hydrostatic pressure to probe the superconducting state of CeRu$_{2}$. Uniaxial stress up to 0.22 GPa induces a dome-shaped evolution of the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, with an initial plateau, successively followed by enhancement and suppression without any structural phase transition. Stress is further found to drive a crossover from anisotropic to isotropic $s$-wave pairing. In contrast, hydrostatic pressure up to 2.2 GPa leaves $T_{\rm c}$ largely unchanged but alters the superfluid density from exponential to linear behavior at low temperatures, indicative of nodal superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure. Taken together, these results indicate that CeRu$_{2}$ occupies an ideal position in parameter space, enabling highly responsive and multifold tunability of superconductivity in this three-dimensional correlated electronic system. This warrants further quantitative analysis of the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic correlations, and pairing symmetry.</p>

            <p>Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Learning a potential formulation for rate-and-state friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengduo Liu, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Nadia Lapusta</p>
            <p>Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.</p>

            <h2>From Spheres to Cones: Structural Instabilities and Acidity at Conical Regions in Trivalent Metal Ion Nano-clusters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihong Shi, Han Nguyen, Mateo Pescador Arboleda, Styliani Consta</p>
            <p>Sub-nanometer aqueous clusters containing a single trivalent metal cation can exhibit charge-induced structural instabilities. Here, we present computational evidence that clusters containing a single \ce{Fe^{3+}}, \ce{Lu^{3+}}, or \ce{La^{3+}} ion undergo continuous geometric transformations as a consequence of this instability. These clusters dynamically evolve across their potential energy landscape, adopting triangular, elongated two-point, single-point, and more spherical configurations often with distinct conical surface protrusions. The manifestation of this instability differs from that observed in mesoscopic and microscopic droplets containing macroions, where stable ``star-like'' structures form, characterized by a specific number of conical protrusions that varies with the droplet size. In the present study, we find that the orientation of the \ce{H2O} molecules surrounding the metal ion is influenced not only by the electric field of the trivalent ion but also by the local conical protrusions. To further investigate the local acidity in the conical protrusions, we employ a proxy model system consisting of an aqueous nano-cluster containing three \ce{H3O+} ions, simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics. Within the conical regions of the cluster, protons exhibit diffusion across several water molecules, in contrast to the more localized proton delocalization observed in the compact body of the cluster. These findings suggest that local geometry can significantly modulate acidity in highly charged nano-clusters, with potential implications for understanding charge-transfer and ionization mechanisms in techniques such as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and complement interpretations from infrared spectroscopic data.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel</p>
            <p>Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic adsorption potential of superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiu Hui Wu, Jiamin Niu, Kejiang Zhou</p>
            <p>Based on the general thermodynamic analysis of Polanyi adsorption potential, the adsorption potential condition for superconductors is obtained exactly by using the quantum state equation we presented. Because this adsorption potential results in changes of electron concentration, temperature and pressure in a certain volume (adsorption space) adjacent to the surface of the lattice, the composition and structure of superconductors are of course decisive for the adsorption potential. Then we calculate the molar adsorption potentials for those typical superconductors, and find that it is positively correlated to the superconductivity temperature , which reveals that those high-superconductors are mainly determined by the higher molar adsorption potentials. In addition, the adsorption potential at still works despite the disappearance of the energy gap of the BCS theory. This shows that beyond the electron-phonon interaction mechanism, the Cooper-paired electrons are mainly formed by this physical adsorption potential for high-superconductors. This adsorption potential theory could explain almost all common facts about high-temperature superconductors, including many anomalies of the normal and superconducting states.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.</p>

            <p>The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure, and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced $\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$ hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.</p>

            <h2>The electronic and transport properties in the Haldane-Hubbard with odd-parity altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minghuan Zeng, Zheng Qin, Ling Qin, Shiping Feng, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang</p>
            <p>The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.</p>

            <p>The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics. Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern number C > 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1 and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v = 5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition, we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C > 1) that develops continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of the fractional phases with C < 1.</p>

            <h2>An analytical model for the remote epitaxial potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason K Kawasaki, Quinn T Campbell</p>
            <p>We propose an analytical model for the remote bonding potential of the substrate that permeates through graphene during remote epitaxy. Our model, based on a Morse interatomic potential, includes the attenuation due to (1) the increased separation between film and substrate and (2) free carrier screening from graphene. Compared with previous slab density functional theory calculations, which use the electrostatic potential as a proxy for bonding, our analytical model provides a more direct description of bonding, explicitly includes screening (which is often ignored), and is based on simple, interpretable, and well benchmarked parameters. We show that the magnitude of $|\phi_{remote}|$ for typical semiconductor and oxide substrates is few meV, similar to the van der Waals potential of graphene. This suggests interference between the graphene and remote substrate potentials, plus interfacial reconstructions, must be considered when interpreting experiments on remote epitaxy. We use our model to interpret previous experiments from the remote epitaxy and related literature, highlighting connections to moire epitaxy and to the ordering of graphite intercalation compounds. Our model also points to tests, based on tunable screening and spatial extent of the substrate potential, that may increase the strength of the remote potential towards the more idealized picture.</p>

            <p>Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <p>Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiewei Ding, Jiahao Su, Ho-Kin Tang, Wing Chi Yu</p>
            <p>Continuous spin models with long-range interactions of the form $r^{-\sigma}$, where $r$ is the distance between two spins and $\sigma$ controls the decay of the interaction, exhibit enhanced order that competes with thermal disturbances, leading to a richer variety of phases and types of phase transitions. In-depth research in this area not only aids in comprehending the complex behaviors in theoretical models but also provides valuable insights into the diverse phase transitions observed in real materials. Here, we identify that the true long-range ordered phase encompasses distinct scaling regimes, which we term Enhance Long-Range Ordered (EnLRO) and Reduce Long-Range Ordered (ReLRO) regimes. In the one-dimensional XY model, the crossover from EnLRO to ReLRO regimes occurs around $\sigma \approx 1.575$, while in two dimensions, the crossover happens near $\sigma \approx 3.2$. Applying finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents that characterize the order-to-disorder phase transitions in the EnLRO and ReLRO regimes, constructing comprehensive phase diagrams. The analysis is further extended to the 1D and 2D long-range Heisenberg models, where we find the EnLRO-ReLRO crossover at $\sigma \approx 1.575$ and $\sigma \approx 3.22$, respectively. The similar crossover points suggest that the distinction between EnLRO and ReLRO regimes is a generic feature in continuous spin models with long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>We present a thorough symmetry-based classification of superconducting order parameters that is independent of their microscopic origins. Our approach involves classifying pairing states through the pairwise permutation of spatial, temporal, spin, and orbital indices, focusing on the parities of the relative coordinates and times of the paired fields. This framework leads to the emergence of new classes of superconducting states, which we visualize as a multidimensional cube representing the relative parities in space and time, referred to as the Berezinskii-Abrahams hypercube. While some predicted states, such as odd-frequency superconductors, have been previously discussed, our symmetry analysis also reveals states that have yet to be explored, including odd-frequency Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states. Furthermore, we draw parallels to the classification of particle-hole states, and reiterate the possibility of new states, such as odd-frequency density waves.</p>

A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy release of ~Rln2.

            <h2>Active anisotropic diffusion of microparticles in nematic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal powered by light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrycja Kadzialka, Lech Sznitko, Pawel Karpinski</p>
            <p>We explore the diffusion dynamics of a Brownian microparticle in a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (LCLC). In the planarly oriented nematic phase, the microparticle exhibits levitation and anisotropic two-dimensional diffusion. Upon illumination with light resonant with the absorption spectrum of the solution, we observe a transition to active anisotropic diffusion, driven by the disruption of the molecular stacking in the liquid crystal. Notably, while light absorption increases both the molecular kinetic energy and the overall temperature of the solution, it manifests at the microscopic level as anisotropic active diffusion of the microparticles, revealing a novel light-driven non-equilibrium transport mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Temperature dependence of surface superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Besproswanny, Sebastian Schimmel, Yanina Fasano, Grigory Shipunov, Saicharan Aswartham, Danny Baumann, Bernd Büchner, Christian Hess</p>
            <p>The Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently been identified as a promising candidate material for intrinsic topological surface superconductivity emerging from the Fermi arc states of the material with a sizeable superconducting gap. We report the temperature evolution of the superconducting excitation spectrum using scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the range of $8-45\,$K. A large low-temperature gap in the order of $\Delta \approx 9\,$meV and a closing of the gap around $T_c \approx 45\,$K is observed. Thus, our results confirm the previously indicated high $T_c$-like superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$.</p>

Based on analytical and numerical approaches, a number of effects caused by the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the vortex have been predicted: a significant increase in the skyrmion radius, a change in its chirality in the case of a coaxial configuration of the vortex and skyrmion, and modification of the skyrmion shape in the case of an eccentric configuration. Recent experiments studying these effects are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Bulk spin-orbit torque-driven spin Hall nano-oscillators using PtBi alloys</h2>

            <p>Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in $\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and 0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions. Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100 nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm) and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively. Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access memory.</p>

Using a driven three-band lattice model, we show that the Rabi frequency diverges as the system approaches an EP due to the coalescence of eigenstates. We demonstrate that this divergence manifests in experimentally accessible power oscillations, establishing a direct observable for self-orthogonality.

            <h2>Quantum-Annealing Enhanced Machine Learning for Interpretable Phase Classification of High-Entropy Alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Ibarra Hoyos, Gia-Wei Chern, Israel Klich, Joseph Poon</p>
            <p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves, Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step toward practical quantum acceleration in materials discovery pipelines.</p>

            <h2>Rigid-Body Anisotropy in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Liu, Yang Gao, Qian Niu</p>
            <p>Characterizing the anisotropic structure in noncollinear antiferromagnets is essential for antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we provide a microscopic theory linking the anisotropy effects induced by the rigid-body rotation of spin order to spin-orbit coupling. Our method goes beyond the conventional magnetic group theory, offering a concise yet powerful tool to characterize diverse anisotropy effects in complex magnetic systems. Using the group representation theory of the spin group, we obtain a set of basis functions formed from tensor elements of spin-orbit vector--which originates from spin-orbit coupling and is tied to the rigid-body rotation of the spin order--to systematically describe the structure of anisotropy effects. As a concrete example, we apply our framework to coplanar antiferromagnets Mn$_3$Sn and Mn$_3$Ir, demonstrating that the corresponding basis functions can well capture both the geometric and magnitude dependencies of the magnetic anisotropy energy and anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our framework to broader classes of anisotropy phenomena in magnetic systems.</p>

            <p>We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully consistent with the symmetry analysis.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) is a powerful technique providing for crystal structure solutions of sub-micron sized crystals too small for structure determination via X-ray techniques. The entry requirement, however, of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) adapted with bespoke software for coordinated sample stage rotation and continuous electron diffraction data acquisition has generally inhibited the wider uptake of 3DED. To address this limitation, we present novel software GiveMeED appropriate for controlled 3DED data acquisition. The collection of useable reflections beyond 0.8 Å makes 3DED crystallographic processing effectively routine, using standard software and workflows derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) techniques. A full experimental workflow for 3DED on a conventional TEM is described in practical terms, in combination with direct imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for the return of comprehensive correlative descriptions of crystal morphologies and sample compositions, with due regard for the quantification of electron flux at each stage of the characterisation process. The accuracy and effectiveness of GiveMeED is demonstrated through structure solutions for case study paracetamol, copper(II) phthalocyanine, and percholorocoronene samples, characterised in their near-native states under controlled low dose conditions at either room or cryogenic temperatures, with determined unit cell parameters and atomic connectivity matching accepted literature X-ray structures for these compounds. To promote the wider adoption of 3DED, we make GiveMeED freely available for use and modification, in support of greater uptake and utilisation of structure solution procedures via electron diffraction.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $π$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustabh Gogoi, Tanay Nag, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

            <p>Dislocations in oxides with ionic/covalent bonding hold the potential of harnessing versatile functionalities. Here, high-density dislocations in a large plastic zone in potassium niobate (KNbO3) crystals are mechanically introduced by room-temperature cyclic scratching to enhance piezocatalytic hydrogen production. Unlike conventional energy-intensive, time-consuming deformation at high temperature, this approach merits efficient dislocation engineering. These dislocations induce local strain and modify the electronic environment, thereby improving surface reactivity and charge separation, which are critical for piezocatalysis. This proof-of-concept offers a practical and sustainable alternative for functionalizing piezoelectric ceramics. Our findings demonstrate that surface-engineered dislocations can effectively improve the piezocatalysis, paving the way for efficient and scalable piezocatalytic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristine V. Ung, Connor A. Roncaioli, Ronald L. Walsworth, Sean M. Blakley</p>
            <p>The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

            <h2>Electro-optic Kerr Effect Induced by Nonlinear Transport in monolayer WTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He-Lin Li, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) can induce optical anisotropy by modifying a material's dielectric tensor, presenting opportunities for novel characterization and device applications. While the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) probes the linear Hall effect (LHE) in magnetic materials, an analogous optical probe for NLHE in non-magnetic, time-reversal symmetric systems remains highly desirable. Here, we theoretically propose and investigate an NLHE-induced Electro-optic Kerr Effect (EOKE) as such a probe. Focusing on monolayer (ML) WTe$_2$, a prototypical NLHE material, our analysis considers contributions from Berry curvature dipole (BCD), Drude, injection, and shift mechanisms. We demonstrate that the EOKE signal in WTe$_2$ is predominantly governed by the BCD. Furthermore, the Kerr angle exhibits temporal oscillations at different optical frequencies, suggesting EOKE as a promising route for the time-resolved detection of NLHE and the dynamic investigation of material topology.</p>

            <p>It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Sanino, I. D'Amico, V. V. França, I. M. Carvalho</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations, we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations, occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal correlations.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p>The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate, particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that, unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to half-filling.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and duration on the dynamics.</p>

Here, we perform a comprehensive high-throughput, first-principles study to explore the vast landscape of 1D transition-metal chalcogenides and halides. Starting with 6,832 candidate structures derived from 28 metals and 8 non-metals, we systematically evaluated their thermodynamic stability by comparing the formation energies of 1D chains against competing 2D phases, mimicking thermodynamic selectivity during nucleation. This screening identified 210 stable 1D magnetic chains. Furthermore, representation learning models revealed that chemical stoichiometry and the electron affinity of the non-metal element are key factors governing 1D stability. The stable materials exhibit a rich spectrum of properties, including diverse magnetic orders (FM, AFM) and Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in MnTe. We discovered 20 ferroelastic chains, with FeTe showing a giant magnetostriction of -5.57%. Other emergent phenomena include Charge Density Wave (CDW) chains in FeTe and NiSe. Finally, our findings propose concrete platforms for quantum applications, such as the predicted realization of Majorana zero modes in a ferromagnetic CrCl2 chain on a superconducting NbSe2 substrate.</p>

In this numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the nickelate system has stimulated enormous interest in the community of condensed matter physics. Recently, superconductivity with an onset transition temperature (Tc^onset) over 40 K was achieved in La3Ni2O7 and (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure due to in-plane compressive strain. This observation has sparked enormous attention because measurements on superconducting properties can be accessible with many commonly used experimental tools. On the other hand, the Tc in these thin films is much lower than that of the bulk bilayer nickelates under pressure. Here we report the enhancement of Tc^onset to over 60 K by applying hydrostatic pressure on the compressively strained superconducting bilayer nickelate thin films. The Tc^onset firstly ramps up with pressure, then it slightly drops down after reaching the maximum Tc^onset at about 61.5 K under a pressure of 9 GPa, showing a dome-like phase diagram. Hall effect measurements reveal that the dominant charge carriers are hole-like with a slight enhancement of charge carrier density with pressure in accompanying with the increase of Tc. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the enhancement of Tc arises from a cooperative amplification of magnetic fluctuations within and between the layers and increased metallicity under pressure. However, this enhancement exhibits saturation at higher pressures. These findings highlight the critical role of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer electronic correlations in bilayer nickelate superconductors and point to the potential of tuning Tc through controlled manipulation of the electronic structure and interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saptarshi Majumdar, Aleksandra Petković</p>
            <p>The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.</p>

            <h2>Polaritonic Machine Learning for Graph-based Data Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Wang, Stefano Scali, Oleksandr Kyriienko</p>
            <p>Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</p>

            <p>We employ several X-ray based techniques, including X-ray diffraction, absorption and resonant inelastic scattering, to disentangle the contributions of individual chemical species to the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of high-entropy oxides. In the benchmark compound Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O and related systems, we unambiguously resolve a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion at the Cu sites, more pronounced in the absence of Ni2+ and Mg2+, suggesting that these ions promote positional order, whereas Cu2+ ions act to destabilize it. Moreover, we detect magnetic excitations and estimate the strength of the interactions between pairs of different magnetic elements. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of the various chemical species in shaping the physical properties of high-entropy oxides.</p>

            <h2>Graphene Design with Parallel Cracks: Abnormal Crack Coalescence and Its Impact on Mechanical Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suyeong Jin, Jung-Wuk Hong, Chiara Daraio, Alexandre F. Fonseca</p>
            <p>Graphene is a material with potential applications in electric, thermal, and mechanical fields, and has seen significant advancements in growth methods that facilitate large-scale production. However, defects during growth and transfer to other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene. Surprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can enhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further research is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure and affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we investigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on the mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The behavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by distances ($W_\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings reveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two existing crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks, $W_\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As $W_\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak stress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress intensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with increasing $W_\text{gap}$. Furthermore, an increase in $W_\text{gap}$ induces a transition in fracture behavior from crack coalescence to independent propagation with intercrack undulation. This shift in fracture behavior demonstrates a brittle-to-ductile transition, as evidenced by increased energy absorption and delayed failure. A design guideline for the initial crack geometry is suggested by correlating peak stress with the $W_\text{gap}$, within a certain range.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable Pre-reduction of Ferromanganese Oxides with Hydrogen: Heating Rate-Dependent Reduction Pathways and Microstructure Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anurag Bajpai, Barak Ratzker, Shiv Shankar, Dierk Raabe, Yan Ma</p>
            <p>The reduction of ferromanganese ores into metallic feedstock is an energy-intensive process with substantial carbon emissions, necessitating sustainable alternatives. Hydrogen-based pre-reduction of manganese-rich ores offers a low-emission pathway to augment subsequent thermic Fe-Mn alloy production. However, reduction dynamics and microstructure evolution under varying thermal conditions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the influence of heating rate on the hydrogen-based direct reduction of natural Nchwaning ferromanganese ore and a synthetic analog. Non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis revealed a complex multistep reduction process with overlapping kinetic regimes. Isoconversional kinetic analysis showed increased activation energy with reduction degree, indicating a transition from surface-reaction to diffusion-controlled reduction mechanisms. Interrupted X-ray diffraction experiments suggested that slow heating enables complete conversion to MnO and metallic Fe, while rapid heating promotes Fe- and Mn-oxides intermixing. Thermodynamic calculations for the Fe-Mn-O system predicted the equilibrium phase evolution, indicating Mn stabilized Fe-containing spinel and halite phases. Microstructural analysis revealed that slow heating rate yields fine and dispersed Fe particles in a porous MnO matrix, while fast heating leads to sporadic Fe-rich agglomerates. These findings suggest heating rate as a critical parameter governing reduction pathway, phase distribution, and microstructure evolution, thus offering key insights for optimizing hydrogen-based pre-reduction strategies towards more efficient and sustainable ferromanganese production.</p>

            <p>The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle J. Ray, Alexander B. Boyd</p>
            <p>Many have speculated whether nonequilibrium systems obey principles of maximum or minimum entropy production. In this work, we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive the condition for the minimum entropy production state (MEPS) for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), even far from equilibrium. We show that real nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) generally violate both the MINEP and MAXEP principles. However, through numerical sampling of large interconnected CTMCs, we find that as system size increases, the steady-state entropy production tends to converge toward the minimum. This suggests that large nonequilibrium systems may self-organize to make efficient use of thermodynamic resources, offering a nuanced perspective on the longstanding debate between MAXEP and MINEP.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimple Rani, B. R. K. Nanda, Prasanjit Samal</p>
            <p>In the ongoing research on two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials with strong intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI), most efforts have focused on doping, Janus engineering, or heterostructure formation to break inversion symmetry and enhance spin--orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a pristine 2D material, monolayer H-FeTe$_2$, can naturally host robust DMI and magnetic anisotropy due to its intrinsic broken inversion symmetry and the strong SOC of Te atoms. We explore the effect of biaxial strain and electron correlation on H-FeTe$_2$ using first-principles DFT+$U$ calculations. We systematically investigate the Heisenberg exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and DMI in the space spanned by strain and correlation. Our results reveal a distinct, non-monotonic strain dependence of both magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and DMI, including a strain-tunable crossover between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic easy axes. A remarkable enhancement of the in-plane DMI is observed under the combined influence of strain and strong correlations, which is unusual for pristine 2D materials and suggests a favorable regime for spintronic this http URL, even in the absence of strain, H-FeTe$_2$ exhibits finite DMI and considerable anisotropy, which is rare for a pure 2D material. Through these findings, we present H-FeTe$_2$ as a unique pristine 2D system with robust and tunable spin interactions for exploring fundamental spin--orbit-driven magnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study the phases of an exactly solvable one dimensional model with $4-$dimensional $\Gamma-$matrix degrees of freedom on each site. The $\Gamma-$matrix model has a large set of competing interactions and displays a rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points.

The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio Davis</p>
            <p>Plasmas and other systems with long-range interactions are commonly found in non-equilibrium steady states that are outside traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, but can be described using generalized statistical mechanics frameworks such as superstatistics, where steady states are treated as superpositions of canonical ensembles under a temperature distribution. In this work we solve the problem of inferring the possible steady states of a composite system $AB$ where subsystem $A$ is described by superstatistics and $E_{AB} = E_A + E_B$. Our result establishes a closure property of superstatistics, namely that $A$ is described by superstatistics if and only if $AB$ and $B$ are also superstatistical with the same temperature distribution. Some consequences of this result are discussed, such as the impossibility of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) for additive subsystems in non-canonical steady states.</p>

In this work, density functional theory simulations are employed to systematically investigate these systems, including temperature-dependent effects and environmental conditions of fluorine saturation and deficiency. We investigated 20 distinct charge compensation schemes for each material, revealing lower defect formation energies in Th:LiSAF than in Th:LiCAF. This suggests that the former may attain a higher concentration of thorium nuclei. Furthermore, we calculated the electric field gradient for the lowest energy structure per compensation pathway. Our investigation shows that results previously reported in the literature apply only to a subset of experimental conditions.</p>

When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p>This article proposes a novel approach for determining exact solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The recommended iterative method provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions, and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined. Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact and unique.</p>

Using the determinant state mapping, we can naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.</p>

            <p>Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</p>

The system is relevant to optics and BEC. The spectrum of the linearized system is found in analytical and numerical forms. SSB and SASB are predicted by dint of the variational approximation, and studied in the numerical form. A particular stable solution, which demonstrates strong asymmetry, is found in an exact form. In the system with the attractive nonlinearity, the SSB of the symmetric ground state is initiated by the modulational instability. It creates stationary asymmetric states through a supercritical bifurcation. In the self-repulsive system, SASB makes the lowest antisymmetric excited state unstable, transforming it into an antisymmetry-breaking oscillatory mode.</p>

            <p>We present a general, constructive procedure to find the basis for tensors of arbitrary order subject to linear constraints by transforming the problem to that of finding the nullspace of a linear operator. The proposed method utilizes standard numerical linear algebra techniques that are highly optimized and well-behaved. Our primary applications are in mechanics where modulus tensors and so-called structure tensors can be used to characterize anisotropy of functional dependencies on other inputs such as strain. Like modulus tensors, structure tensors are defined by their invariance to transformations by symmetry group generators but have more general applicability. The fully automated method is an alternative to classical, more intuition-reliant methods such as the Pipkin-Rivlin polynomial integrity basis construction. We demonstrate the utility of the procedure by: (a) enumerating elastic modulus tensors for common symmetries, and (b) finding the lowest-order structure tensors that can represent all common point groups/crystal classes. Furthermore, we employ these results in two calibration problems using neural network models following classical function representation theory: (a) learning the symmetry class and orientation of a hyperelastic material given stress-strain data, and (b) representing strain-dependent anisotropy of the stress response of a soft matrix-stiff fiber composite in a sequence of uniaxial loadings. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the method in model selection and calibration by: (a) determining structural tensors of a selected order across multiple symmetry groups, and (b) determining a basis for a given group that allows the characterization of all subgroups. Using a common order in both cases allows sparse regression to operate on a common function representation to select the best-fit symmetry group for the data.</p>

We show that the latter modification can be understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs. Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.</p>

However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</p>

            <p>We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with $z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects, with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state.

            <h2>Similarity networks of ordinal-pattern transitions classify falling paper trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angelo A. Flores, Leonardo G. J. M. Voltarelli, Andre S. Sunahara, Haroldo V. Ribeiro, Arthur A. B. Pessa</p>
            <p>Paper fragments in free fall constitute a simple yet paradigmatic mechanical system exhibiting remarkably complex motions. Despite a long history of investigation, this system has defied comprehensive first-principles modeling, motivating the development of phenomenological and experimental approaches to classify the free-fall dynamics of small paper fragments. Here we apply the Bandt-Pompe symbolization method to extract high-dimensional features corresponding to ordinal-pattern transitions (so-called ordinal networks) from observed area time series of video-recorded falling papers shaped as circles, squares, hexagons, and crosses. We then represent each trajectory as a node in a weighted similarity network, with edges encoding pairwise dynamical similarity, and identify motion classes via community detection. Our method automatically clusters trajectories into tumbling and chaotic falls in excellent agreement with expert visual classification. Notably, it outperforms previous approaches based on classical physical features derived from complete three-dimensional trajectories -- especially for cross-shaped papers -- and requires no prior specification of the number of motion classes. We further find that trajectories diverging from expert classifications occupy more central positions in the similarity network, suggesting more complex and ambiguous dynamic behavior.</p>

            <h2>Bounds on the Uniaxial Effective Complex Permittivity of Two-phase Composites and Optimal or Near Optimal Microstructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kshiteej J. Deshmukh, Graeme W. Milton</p>
            <p>Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor, characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial ($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of $\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor. Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in two-dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.</p>

            <h2>Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camron Farhang, Weihang Lu, Kai Du, Yunpeng Gao, Junjie Yang, Sang-Wook Cheong, Jing Xia</p>
            <p>The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirco Erpelding, Adrian Braemer, Martin Gärttner</p>
            <p>Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Naji, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, M. Abdi</p>
            <p>We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</p>

            <p>Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties. Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Nejad, Andrew Zhu, Kesha Sorathia, David P. Tew</p>
            <p>We present domain-based local pair natural orbital Møller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{á}rm{á}n boundary (BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2 methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations, and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.</p>

            <p>We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital Møller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach, Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals. Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs Born--von K{á}rm{á}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to 15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.</p>

We demonstrate the performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene (MLG), revealing spatially resolved electronic inhomogeneities and charge puddles. Our measurements clearly capture temperature-dependent variations in the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context. The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.</p>

            <p>In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks, particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation, incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous degree distributions and community structures, which are typical characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more biologically informed neural networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Tao, Fen Zuo</p>
            <p>The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</p>

This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings.

            <p>We compute the joint distribution of two consecutive eigenphase spacings and their ratio for Haar-distributed $\mathrm{U}(N)$ matrices (the circular unitary ensemble) using our framework for Jánossy densities in random matrix theory, formulated via the Tracy-Widom system of nonlinear PDEs.

This finding suggests the potential to extract subtle finite-size corrections from the energy spectra of quantum-chaotic systems and explains why the deviation of the gap-ratio distribution of the Riemann zeta zeros $\{1/2+i\gamma_n\}, \gamma_n\approx T\gg1$ from the sine-kernel prediction scales as $\left(\log(T/2\pi)\right)^{-3}$.</p>

            <p>Automated material model discovery disrupts the tedious and time-consuming cycle of iteratively calibrating and modifying manually designed models. Non-smooth L1-norm regularization is the backbone of automated model discovery; however, the current literature on automated material model discovery offers limited insights into the robust and efficient minimization of non-smooth objective functions. In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of the form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a metric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed data, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the solution. We investigate both the straightforward case where f is quadratic and the more complex scenario where it is non-quadratic or even non-convex. Importantly, we do not only focus on methods that solve the sparse regression problem for a given value of the regularization parameter a, but propose methods to efficiently compute the entire regularization path, facilitating the selection of a suitable a. Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss their roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we recapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the minimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also known as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically determines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set to zero. Third, we propose to use the proximal gradient method ISTA for automated material model discovery if f is not quadratic, and fourth, we suggest a pathwise extension of ISTA for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate the applicability of all algorithms for the discovery of hyperelastic material models from uniaxial tension and simple shear data.</p>

            <p>A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.</p>

            <p>Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Afonin, A.V. Tulub</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the polaron theory from solid state physics can serve as an interesting analogue model for non-perturbative QCD, at least in the description of nucleons and related low-energy physics of strong interactions. By drawing explicit analogies between polaron physics, arising for an electron moving in an ionic crystal, and physics of pion-nucleon interactions, certain rules for the "polaron/QCD correspondence" are proposed. In polaron theory, the effective fermion mass as a function of the coupling constant is known both in the weak and strong coupling limits. The conjectured "polaron/QCD correspondence" translates these results into strong interactions. It is then shown how application of these rules leads to unexpectedly good quantitative predictions for the nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon sigma term. The polaron approach also predicts that the quark degrees of freedom in the form of the constituent quark account for one-third of the nucleon mass, consistent with lattice predictions. We discuss possible physical reasons underlying the observed quantitative similarity between polaron physics and non-perturbative QCD.</p>

            <p>Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</p>

            <p>An explicit formula for the interaction energy of $n$ vortices in the abelian Higgs (or Ginzburg-Landau) model is derived, valid in the regime where all vortices are close to one another. An immediate consequence of this formula is that the interaction energy of a vortex pair with separation $d$ varies as $d^4$, not $d^2$. The formula contains $n-1$ real coefficients which are fixed by certain spectral data of the Jacobi operator of the cocentred $n$-vortex. The coefficients are computed numerically for $n=2$ and $n=3$ for couplings $0.1\leq \lambda\leq 2.5$. The resulting short range interaction potentials are compared with the results of full field theory simulations for $\lambda=0.5$ and $\lambda=2$, with excellent agreement at small to moderate vortex separation.</p>

            <p>Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.</p>

            <h2>Spectral properties of the zero temperature Edwards-Anderson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly</p>
            <p>An Ising model with random couplings on a graph is a model of a spin glass. While the mean field case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is very well studied, the more realistic lattice setting, known as the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model, has witnessed rather limited progress. In (Chatterjee,'23) chaotic properties of the ground state in the EA model were established via the study of the Fourier spectrum of the two-point spin correlation. A natural direction of research concerns fractal properties of the Fourier spectrum in analogy with critical percolation. In particular, numerical findings (Bray, Moore,'87) seem to support the belief that the fractal dimension of the associated spectral sample drawn according to the Fourier spectrum is strictly bigger than one. Towards this, in this note we introduce a percolation-type argument, relying on the construction of ``barriers'', to obtain new probabilistic lower bounds on the size of the spectral sample.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erdős-Rényi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erdős-Rényi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</p>

            <h2>Non-conservation of the valley density and its implications for the observation of the valley Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Kazantsev, Amelia Mills, Eoin O'Neill, Hao Sun, Giovanni Vignale, Alessandro Principi</p>
            <p>We show that the conservation of the valley density in multivalley insulators is broken in an unexpected way by the electric field that drives the valley Hall effect. This implies that time-reversal-invariant fully gapped insulators, in which no bulk or edge state crosses the Fermi level, can support a valley Hall current in the bulk and yet show no valley density accumulation at the edges. Thus, the valley Hall effect cannot be observed in such systems. If the system is not fully gapped then valley density accumulation at the edges is possible. The accumulation has no contribution from undergap states and can be expressed as a Fermi surface average, for which we derive an explicit formula. We demonstrate the theory by calculating the valley density accumulations in an archetypical valley-Hall insulator: a gapped graphene nanoribbon. Surprisingly, we discover that a net valley density polarization is dynamically generated for certain edge terminations.</p>

            <h2>Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Nedeltcho I. Zahariev, Hassan Chamati, Albert M. Varonov</p>
            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals the importance of the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of $d$-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. This result suggests that the long-sought pairing mechanism in high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates has possibly been found and that the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates. To test the developed theoretical scheme, we explored in detail the recent results of the scanned Josephson modulation microscopy experiment of the modulation of the order parameter due to apex distance super-modulation. Our analysis shows a satisfactory agreement between our theory and the named experiment.</p>

            <p>We performed a detailed study of the intrinsic electronic structure of YRu2Si2 employing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density-functional theory (DFT) based firstprinciples calculations. Electrical and magnetic measurements were conducted on well-oriented highquality single crystals. Bulk physical measurements indicate that the compound exhibits slightly enhanced Pauli paramagnetic behavior, accompanied by electrical transport properties reminiscent of metals. Our ARPES data reveal four fold symmetric Fermi surface with weakly-dispersing bands around the N point originating from Ru d orbitals. We observed the anisotropic characteristics of the band near the N point, showing weak dispersion in the XNX direction and minimal dispersion along the NGN direction. The electronic band structure near the Fermi level is primarily governed by the Ru d orbital, with minor contributions from the Y d and Si p orbitals. Polarization-dependent ARPES results indicate the multi-band and multi-orbital band-character of YRu2Si2. Due to the negligible correlation effect, the observed ARPES data is found to be in good agreement with the DFT results.</p>

            <h2>Ultra-delayed material failure via shear banding after straining an amorphous material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry A. Lockwood, Emily S. Carrington, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>We predict a phenomenon of catastrophic material failure arising suddenly within an amorphous material, with an extremely long delay time since the material was last deformed. By simulating a mesoscopic soft glassy rheology model in one dimension (1D), a mesoscopic elastoplastic model in 1D and 2D, and a continuum fluidity model in 1D, we demonstrate the basic physics to involve a dramatic ultra-delayed shear banding instability, in which strain suddenly strongly localises within the material and the stress drops precipitously. The delay time after the long historical shear strain was applied before failure occurs increases steeply with decreasing strain amplitude, decreasing working temperature, and increasing sample annealing prior to shear. In demonstrating the same physics -- which is directly testable experimentally and in particle simulations -- to obtain within three different constitutive models, we suggest it may be generic across amorphous materials. The counter-intuitive prediction of catastrophic material failure long after any deformation was last applied could have important consequences for material processing and performance.</p>

            <p>In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</p>

            <h2>Fokker-Planck approach to wave turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Schubring</p>
            <p>The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian. A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation. Similar equations are associated to divergences in higher-order cumulants. It is additionally shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.</p>

            <p>Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials</p>

Multiple fundamental frequencies and light effective quasiparticle masses are obtained by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula fits. The high resolution of the low-temperature FFT spectra allows us to investigate individual peaks in detail for the magnetic fields applied along all three crystallographic axes and the planes in between. Our investigation can confirm the density functional theory (DFT) calculated band structure and its corresponding Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.</p>

            <h2>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Boyer, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schrödinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</p>

            <h2>Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan Scott, Michal Kwasigroch</p>
            <p>The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory -- an extension of Read-Newns theory to the underscreened Kondo lattice -- we observe in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale. We also notice that in some compounds the destabilisation of local crystalline anisotropy can be the beginning of a cascade of decreasing energy scales. Once the anisotropy changes, further growth of magnetic correlations with cooling can lead to a rapid quenching of the hard-axis susceptibility, and at even lower temperatures, the high-temperature easy axis is revealed via a metamagnetic jump when a high magnetic field is applied along it.</p>

            <h2>The Mechanics of Nucleation and Growth and the Surface Tensions of Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Langford, Ahmad K. Omar</p>
            <p>Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions. Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos, Shoki Sugimoto, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</p>

            <p>The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</p>

We prove that negative electronic specific heat, $C_\mathrm{el} < 0$, is sufficient to trigger the instability. Specifically, the instability sets in as soon as the quasiparticle weight becomes negative over a range of energies, even before $C_\mathrm{el}$ turns negative. This is an inherently nonequilibrium phenomenon, occurring prior to the formation of any equilibrium phase. Depending on the system, it can proceed along different pathways, ultimately resulting in a structural transition to an insulating or metallic state.</p>

            <p>Advances in controlled polymerization have enabled the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers like molecular knots and linear[n]catenane. These aesthetic macromolecules with unique topological constraints in the form of mechanical bonds are well known for their fascinating transport and rheological properties in the development of molecular machines and in knotted protein dynamics in biological applications. The diffusion dynamics of such macromolecular structures with large internal degrees of freedom are generally studied by using an equivalent size parameter, i.e., hydrodynamic radius, defined using Zimm theory. Although diffusion rates are expected to depend strongly on the molecular topological constraints in macromolecules, their explicit effects on translational and reorientational dynamics are still unknown. Here, we perform an in silico study on the diffusion dynamics of seven topologically distinct polymer chains in the limit of infinite dilution using multi-particle collision dynamics. The modeled polymers are linear, ring, linear[2]catenane, trefoil knot, linear[3]catenane, cyclic[3]catenane, and Borromean ring. The molecular weights of these macromolecules are selected such that the resulting hydrodynamic radius is approximately equal to each other. We show that while the translational diffusion coefficients of these topologically distinct polymer chains are approximately equal to each other in agreement with the Zimm theory, there are significant differences among the values of the corresponding rotational diffusion coefficients. We show that the presence of mechanical bonds in the polymer chains slows down the rotational diffusion significantly, thus suggesting the role of molecular topology on reaction kinetics of macromolecules.</p>

Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. V. Sreenivasa Reddy, Guang-Yu Guo</p>
            <p>The CoSi-family of materials (CoSi, CoGe, RhSi and RhGe) forms a cubic chiral structure and hosts unconventional multifold chiral fermions, such as spin-1 and spin-3/2 fermions, leading to intriguing phenomena like long Fermi arc surface states and exotic transport properties. Recent interest on the phonon behavior in chiral materials is growing due to their unique characteristics, including topological phonons, protected surface states and the chiral phonons with non-zero angular momentums. In this study, we explore the topological and chiral phonon behavior in RhGe, using first-principles density functional theory calculations as well as the symmetry and topological analysis. In particular, we uncover six spin-1 triply degenerate nodal points at the $\Gamma$ point and six charge-2 double Weyl points at the R point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). Interestingly, these topological features are identical to that in the electronic band structure without the electron spin-orbit coupling, of the same material. We expect that this finding not only applies to the CoSi family but also is universal. Secondly, we find that chiral crystal RhGe hosts chiral phonon modes with a phonon angular momentum (PAM) and an associated phonon magnetic moment (PMM), everywhere in the BZ except at high symmetry points such as $\Gamma$, R, X and M. The PAM and PMM are large along the chiral rotation axis and also in the vicinity of the topological nodes. Our study also reveals that all the topological phonon modes are chiral. However, the reverse is not always true. Among other things, our finding of the coexistence of topological and chiral phonon modes in chiral RhGe not only deepens our understanding of the phonon behavior in the CoSi-family but also opens new pathways for developing advanced materials and devices.</p>

            <h2>Tightly bound solitons and vortices in three-dimensional bosonic condensates with the electromagnetically-induced gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zibin Zhao, Guilong Li, Huanbo Luo, Bin Liu, Guihua Chen, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li</p>
            <p>The $1/r$ long-range interaction, induced by laser illumination, offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solutions, we find that self-trapped states in this setting , with attractive nonlocal and repulsive local interactions, resemble tightly-bound compactons. However, these are not true compactons but rather \textit{tightly self-trapped modes} (TSTMs), with small-amplitude nonvanishing tails. The structure of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable % TSTMs with embedded vorticity, exist in the same setting, with winding numbers up to $S=6$ (at least). Addressing two-TSTM interactions, we find that pairs of ground states (GSs, with $S=0$), as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs (with $S_1=S_2$ and $S_1=-S_2$, respectively), form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex TSTMs, set in slow motion by kicks, are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a GS soliton, that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, shedding the angular momentum with emitted radiation, or, alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.</p>

            <p>Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the long-standing trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has limited their practical applications. We present DeePTB-NEGF, an integrated framework combining deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian prediction with non-equilibrium Green's Function methodology to enable accurate quantum transport simulations in open boundary conditions with 2-3 orders of magnitude acceleration. We demonstrate DeePTB-NEGF through two challenging applications: comprehensive break junction simulations with over $10^4$ snapshots, showing excellent agreement with experimental conductance histograms; and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FET) at experimental dimensions, reproducing measured transfer characteristics for a 41 nm channel CNT-FET ($\sim 8000$ atoms, $3\times10^4$ orbitals) and predicting zero-bias transmission spectra for a 180 nm CNT ($\sim 3\times 10^4$ atoms, $10^5$ orbitals), showcasing the framework's capability for large-scale device simulations. Our systematic studies across varying geometries confirm the necessity of simulating realistic experimental structures for precise predictions. DeePTB-NEGF bridges the longstanding gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a scalable tool for high-throughput and large-scale quantum transport simulations that enables previously inaccessible nanoscale device investigations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sylwia Gutowska, Karolina Górnicka, Paweł Wójcik, Tomasz Klimczuk, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</p>
            <p>This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Baconnier, Margot H. Teunisse, Martin van Hecke</p>
            <p>Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.</p>

In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</p>

            <h2>Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys using DFPT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surya T. Bijjala, Susan R. Atlas, Pankaj Kumar</p>
            <p>The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ground-state properties of the periodic Anderson model on the square lattice across various band fillings. Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.</p>

            <p>Soft pair potentials predict a reentrant liquid phase for high concentrations, a behavior not observed experimentally. Here, very soft microgels confined at an oil-water interface are used as a model system of particles interacting via a soft potential in 2D. Interfacial rheology measurements demonstrate the existence of different flow regimes that depend on the compression of the monolayer. Such a compression also leads to a non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli and of the yield stress of the monolayer. These results, together with the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer, are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D system of particles interacting with a Hertzian-like potential. Remarkably, due to the non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli, we observe \textit{isoelastic} points where the monolayer shows the same stiffness at very different concentrations. These points are the experimental manifestation of the predicted reentrant liquid phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. G. Vasin, S. V. Remizov, A. A. Elistratov</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.</p>

Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive, within a non-pertubative treatment of disorder effects, the third-order nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps. In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.</p>

            <p>Wide-band gap oxides such as ZnO offer a favorable environment for spin defect qubits due to their dilute nuclear spin background and potential for ultra-high purity. Identifying deep-level defect qubits is essential for room-temperature optical initialization and quantum emission, robust against environmental noise. In this work, we theoretically design deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. By employing first-principles calculations, we predict that the molybdenum-vacancy complex has promising spin and optical properties, including a spin-triplet ground state, optically-allowable transition in the visible range with a high quantum yield, and an exceptionally small Huang-Rhys factor around 5, compared to 10-30 in known defects in ZnO. In particular, we found a long spin decoherence T2 time at 4 ms after considering both nuclear spin baths and paramagnetic impurity baths' interactions, with the latter dominant at impurity concentration above 0.035 ppm. Finally, we predict the energy diagram with spin-selective intersystem crossing for a spin-photon interface, and suggest the protocols for efficient optical readout. With a strong spin-orbit coupling and the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion in the proposed defect, we reveal that it supports high-fidelity single-shot readout of electron-spin at high temperature and a wide range of magnetic field.</p>

We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</p>

            <p>We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha >D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha > 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains Lévy diffusion for $\alpha < 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha > D$.</p>

            <p>The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays ferromagnetism-like properties with compensated magnetization, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Furthermore, we extend the stacking rule to collinear compensated ferrimagnets, where the opposite-spin sublattices are not connected by any symmetry operator, yet the net magnetization remains zero. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 and Fe2MoSe4 bilayers. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.</p>

This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet.

            <p>Stability of elongated (``slender") quantum droplets (QDs) with embedded unitary and multiple vorticity is a problem that was not solved previously. In this work, we propose a solution which relies upon the use of the spatial modulation of the inter-species scattering length in the binary Bose-Einstein condensates, in the form of a two-dimensional axisymmetric Gaussian, shaped by means of the optical Feshbach resonance. The corresponding effective nonlinear trapping potential supports completely stable elongated QDs with vorticity $S=0$ and partly stable families of elongated QDs with $S=1,2,3,4$ (other nonlinear systems do not maintain stability of vortex droplets with $\geq 2$). We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with $% S=1$ moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with $S=\pm 1$ are quasi-elastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs. Application of a torque to the vector QD sets in the gyroscopic regime of robust precession, which realizes a macroscopic spin-orbit-coupling effect.</p>

            <p>The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by the interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1\textdegree\ hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3\textdegree, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37\textdegree\ twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands over unusually large ranges of density. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of behavior commonly seen in magic-angle samples near integer filling at low magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiefu Cen, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviors, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviors, interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction is the XXZ type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuke Lyu, Deeksha Chandorkar, Samarth Kapoor, So Takei, Erik S. Sørensen, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Peng, Shibo Fang, Pin Ho, Tong Zhou, Junwei Liu, Yee Sin Ang</p>
            <p>Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</p>

            <h2>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</p>

            <h2>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</h2>

            <p>DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Xing (Wilczek Quantum Center, School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China)</p>
            <p>We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira</p>
            <p>Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.</p>

            <h2>Searching for evidence of strengthening from short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Novin Rasooli, Matthew Daly</p>
            <p>The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains debated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct observation of this effect is elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that instead searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns suggesting a positive finding may be explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</p>

            <p>We report a novel approach to engineering large voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) and enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface of single-layer graphene (SLG) and NiFe (Py) through non-covalent functionalization with Platinum (II) 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl porphyrin (Pt-porphyrin). Using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown SLG, we demonstrate that Pt-porphyrin functionalization significantly increases the SOC and enables robust voltage modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy, as confirmed by spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJ/(V-m)) is achieved, accompanied by an order-of-magnitude enhancement in spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) compared to pristine SLG. The resonance field exhibits a clear, reversible shift under applied gate voltage, confirming robust electric-field modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the structural integrity and effective charge transfer at the functionalized interface. Electrical characterization of back-gated graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) further reveals tunable electronic properties upon functionalization. Our results establish functionalized graphene/ferromagnet interfaces as a promising platform for low-power, voltage-controlled spintronic devices, paving the way for scalable, energy-efficient memory and logic technologies</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suryashekhar Kusari, Arnab Das, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Arti Garg</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p>

            <p>The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</p>

            <p>A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions.

            <p>Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M.S. Kim</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on Rényi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha>1$, while is a constant for $\alpha<1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael K.-H. Kiessling, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan</p>
            <p>The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega>0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nakshatra Gangopadhay, Sayan Choudhury</p>
            <p>Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</p>

            <p>The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaibhav Sharma, Erich J Mueller</p>
            <p>We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can simultaneously extract many quantitative features of a state including some traditional quantities such as entanglement depth, k-uniformity and entanglement entropy. Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</p>

            <h2>Order in disorder: increased carrier mobility of downscaled amorphous semiconductors for high-speed thin film transistors in flexible electronics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuezhou Luo, Andrew John Flewitt</p>
            <p>Amorphous semiconductors are important channel semiconductors in thin film transistors (TFTs) which serve not only active-matrix displays, but also flexible electronics for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, a great limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities relative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established band fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous semiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling, without any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the intrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long gap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device uniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band tail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation length scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and medium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Masi, Itai Einav</p>
            <p>The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</p>

            <p>There are various methods for modeling phase transformations in materials science, including general classes of phase-field methods and reactive diffusion methodologies, which most importantly differ in their treatment of interface energy. These methodologies appear mutually exclusive since the respective numerical schemes only allow for their primary use case. To address this issue, a novel methodology for modeling phase transformations in multi-phase, multi-component systems, with particular emphasis on applications in materials science and the study of substitutional alloys is introduced. The fundamental role of interface energy in the evolution of a material's morphology will be studied by example of binary and ternary systems. Allowing full control over the interface energy quantity enables more detailed investigations and bridges the gaps between known methods. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases, such as vacancy-mediated diffusion. Furthermore a scheme for relating Onsager and Diffusion coefficients is proposed, which allows us to study the intricate coupling that is observed in multicomponent systems. We hope to contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mircea Bejan, Benjamin Béri, Max McGinley</p>
            <p>We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saverio Rossi, Leonardo Di Bari, Martin Weigt, Francesco Zamponi</p>
            <p>Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences - particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary dynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms.</p>

To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering.

            <h2>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</p>

            <h2>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin S. Sloth</p>
            <p>I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubbled-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time-scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</p>

Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential. Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.</p>

            <p>When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</p>

            <p>A fourth-order Schrödinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non-parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schrödinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler (Lent and Kirkner in J Appl Phys 67:6353, 1990; Ben Abdallah et al. in ZAMP 48:135-155, 1997; Ben Abdallah in J. Math. Phys. 41:4241-4261, 2000), where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated, and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the second-order Schrödinger equation in the effective mass approximation.</p>

            <p>The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</p>

However, such processes are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process, or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically, focusing on processes that can be interpreted as driven by interactions between populations of different types of individuals in the network. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics that significantly simplifies the problem, and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on networks.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <p>Evidence is presented that the accuracy of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics framework is improved using the coupled entropy, which carefully establishes the physical measures of complex systems. While Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset, questions have persisted as to how to evaluate whether its proposed solutions properly characterize the uncertainty of heavy-tailed distributions. The entropy of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is $1+\kappa+\ln\sigma$, where $\kappa$ is the shape or nonlinear coupling and $\sigma$ is the scale. A generalized entropy should retain the uncertainty due to the scale, while minimizing the dependence of the nonlinear coupling. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD instead subtracts a function of the inverse-scale and converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. Colloquially, the Tsallis entropy is too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) rectifies the positive dependence on the scale but introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy measures the uncertainty of the GPD to be $1+\ln_\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\sigma=1+\frac{1+\kappa}{\kappa}(\sigma^\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}-1)$, which converges to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. The training of the coupled variational autoencoder is an example of the unique ability of the coupled entropy to improve the performance of complex systems.</p>

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time.

We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <h2>Long-Term Stability of Superconducting Metal Superhydrides</h2>

            <p>Zhou et al., in their recent publication (Nat. Commun. 16, 1135, 2025), reported the synthesis of lanthanum superhydride, LaHx (x = 10.2-11.1), by laser heating LaH3 with NH3BH3 at a pressure of 170 GPa and investigated the temporal evolution of the NMR spectra of the reaction products. They observed a gradual decrease in the 1H-NMR signal intensity assigned to the synthesized metal hydride, accompanied by an increase in molecular hydrogen within the sample chamber over a period of 50 days. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that LaH10 progressively decomposes into LaH3 and H2 within two months after synthesis at its formation pressure of 170 GPa. Here, we demonstrate that, under their formation conditions, metal superhydrides are thermodynamically more stable than metal trihydrides. Furthermore, we present direct experimental evidence - based on X-ray diffraction and four-probe electrical resistance measurements - confirming the stability of both the crystal lattice and high-temperature superconducting properties of the Fm-3m-LaH10 phase for more than five years. This long-term stability is consistent with predictions from quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <h2>Ultrasensitive Magnetometer based on Cusp Points of the Photon-Magnon Synchronization Mode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinlin Mi, Jinwei Rao, Lijun Yan, Xudong Wang, Bingbing Lyu, Bimu Yao, Shishen Yan, Lihui Bai</p>
            <p>Ultrasensitive magnetometers based on spin resonances have led to remarkable achievements. However, the gyromagnetic ratios of these spin resonances that determine the responsivity of magnetometers to weak magnetic fields are inherently constrained by the Land$\acute{e}$ g-factor of particles, such as the electron, with a constant gyromagnetic ratio of $\gamma_e=2\pi\times28$ GHz/T. Here, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive magnetometer based on the cusp point (CP) of photon-magnon synchronization modes (PMSMs). The PMSM's gyromagnetic ratio at the CP is enhanced to $37\gamma_e$ and further amplified to $236\gamma_e$ by utilizing the sixth-order oscillating mode of the PMSM. Moreover, the emission linewidth of the PMSM can be reduced to 0.06 Hz, resulting in excellent sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. These outstanding properties position our magnetometer to potentially achieve superior sensitivity to conventional magnetometers. Our work introduces a cost-effective prototype for the next generation of magnetometry, and may advance scientific research and technologies that rely on ultrasensitive magnetic field detection.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <h2>Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kateryna Foyevtsova, Ilya Elfimov, George A. Sawatzky</p>
            <p>An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p>

            <p>We show how amplitude modulated, coherent high-frequency drives can be used to access otherwise difficult to reach collective resonances and off-resonantly induce parametric instabilities. In particular, we demonstrate that difficult to access antiferromagnetic resonances in the THz range can be parametrically excited with signals at optical frequencies via a mechanism that we call Modulated Floquet Parametric Driving (MFPD). We study spin pumping and the formation of entangled, two-mode squeezed magnon pairs in anisotropic antiferromagnets under MFPD. Furthermore, we show that MFPD induces transitions to symmetry breaking steady-states in which dynamical spin patterns are formed by resonant magnon pairs.</p>

            <h2>Off-resonant light-induced topological phase transition and thermoelectric transport in semi-Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vassilios Vargiamidis, P. Vasilopoulos, Neophytos Neophytou</p>
            <p>We show that a semi-Dirac (SD) system with an inversion symmetry breaking mass exhibits a topological phase transition when irradiated with off-resonant light. Using Floquet theory, we derive the band structure, Chern numbers, phase diagram, and we show that as the light intensity is swept at fixed mass, the SD system undergoes normal-Chern-normal insulator transition. Along the phase boundaries we observe single semi-Dirac-cone (SSDC) semimetal states in which one SD cone is gapless and the other gapped. The nontrivial Berry curvature distribution $\Omega(\mathbf{k}) \neq -\Omega ( - \mathbf{k} )$ generates an orbital magnetization $M$ and anomalous Nernst ($\alpha_{xy}$) and thermal Hall ($\kappa_{xy}$) conductivities. We show that $M$ remains constant as the Fermi level $E_F$ scans the insulating gap, but it changes linearly with it in the Chern insulator (CI) phase, as expected. In the normal insulator phase, we find that $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits a dip-peak profile which is reversed in the CI phase. We also find that switching the light's circular polarization from left to right induces a sign change in $M$, $\alpha_{xy}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$, regardless of the topological phase, thereby allowing us to reverse the direction of flow of the transverse charge and heat currents. Further, we evaluate the components of the charge ($\sigma_{aa}$), thermoelectric ($\alpha_{aa}$), and thermal ($\kappa_{aa}$) conductivity tensors ($a=x, y$) and examine the effect of light on them. With a linear dispersion along the $y$-direction, we find that $\alpha_{yy}$ and $\kappa_{yy}$ are significantly larger than $\alpha_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$, respectively, due to the much larger squared Dirac velocity $v_y^2$ compared to $v_x^2$.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$, a charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, offers a platform to explore this interplay. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ via high-field magnetotransport measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using three distinct field-current configurations, we resolve four out of five FS pockets predicted in the CDW phase, with no evidence of residual non-CDW features - in contrast to recent ARPES studies. Remarkably, we identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical hole pocket and a high-frequency quantum oscillation contribution to the magnetoresistance attributable to magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29 eV. Additionally, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance (MR) for all field orientations when current flows along the $a-$axis, with a distinct high-field linear MR regime emerging near the $c-$axis, consistent with FS hot spots and magnetic breakdown. Our results establish TaTe$_4$ as a paradigmatic system where CDW-driven FS reconstruction governs the bulk electronic structure, enabling new routes to probe the novel physics that can arise in the intersection between correlated electronic states and topological band features.</p>

            <h2>Thermoelectric optimization and quantum-to-classical crossover in gate-controlled two-dimensional semiconducting nanojunctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chang Chen, Yu-Chen Chang</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <h2>Control of nonreciprocal charge transport in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructures with Fermi level tuning and superconducting-layer thickness</h2>

            <p>Nonreciprocal charge transport (NCT) is defined as a phenomenon where electrical resistance depends on the current direction. It has been drawing much attention because it sensitively reflects the symmetry breaking of material systems. A topological insulator (TI)/superconductor (SC) heterostructure where the topological surface state (TSS) of the TI layer is proximitized with the SC layer is one such system that presents a sizable NCT due to a large spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity. Here, we report a control of the magnitude and sign of NCT: reversal of the direction of NCT by tuning the Fermi energy of TSS of the TI layer with respect to the charge neutral point by systematic regulation of Sb composition $x$ in a TI/SC heterostructures of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$/FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$. The result is consistent with the model of a TSS proximitized with superconductivity. Furthermore, we find a significant enhancement of the magnitude of NCT in the TI/SC heterostructures by reducing the thickness of the SC layer. The enhancement can be ascribed to the inversion-symmetry breaking of the FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$ SC-layer itself adjacent to the TI layer. Our results highlight the essential role of the TSS for exhibiting NCT and offer new knobs to control the direction and magnitude of NCT.</p>

            <h2>Modulation of energy and angular momentum radiation of two-dimensional altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong-Mei Zhang, Zhi- Ping Niu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the energy and angular momentum radiation of altermagnets under Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and external magnetic fields. Using an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we derive electronic energy bands and calculate optical conductivity via the Kubo formula. Results show that RSOC strength, altermagnet interactions strength, and Neel vector direction notably affect the optical conductivity of altermagnet metals. Energy radiation is highly sensitive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, with a saturation effect beyond a particular value, and its peak emission rate is lower than that of graphene due to reduced conductivity. Different from usual semi-conductor, semi-metal or Dirac materials, eg. graphene or silicene, altermagnets generate angular momentum radiation with specific Rashba spin-orbit coupling and altermagnet interaction strength. Angular momentum radiation is minimally reactive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling at low altermagnet interactions strength values but exhibits drastic oscillations between extreme values as altermagnet interactions strength reaches a critical point, showing high sensitivity. These findings suggest that adjusting these parameters can tailor altermagnet applications in spintronics and quantum technologies, potentially leading to innovative devices with customized radiation attributes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Avanzini, Massimiliano Esposito, Emanuele Penocchio</p>
            <p>We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals new key principles for their design and optimization.</p>

            <p>Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</p>

            <p>A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed a cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also agrees with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared, and they give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</p>

Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering, not to be confused with multiple Andreev reflection. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.</p>

            <p>Experimental studies on moiré materials have predominantly focused on twisted hexagonal lattice with low-energy states near the $\Gamma$- or K-points, where the electronic dispersion is typically isotropic. In contrast, we introduce a class of semiconducting transition metal carbides (MXenes) $M_2$C$T_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y; $T$ = O, F, Cl) as a new platform for M-valley moiré materials, which exhibit pronounced anisotropic properties. Using Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and Zr$_2$CO$_2$ as representative examples, we perform large-scale \emph{ab initio} calculations and demonstrate that their AB-stacked twisted homobilayer hosts three threefold rotational-symmetry-related M-valleys with time-reversal symmetry. These systems show striking anisotropic band flattening in the conduction band minimum. To elucidate the underlying physics, we construct a simplified moiré Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of the band structure, revealing the origins of anisotropic flattening through the mechanisms of band folding and interlayer tunneling. Our findings expand the current landscape of moiré materials, establishing valley- and spin-degenerate, two-dimensional arrays of quasi-one-dimensional systems as promising platforms for exploring many interesting correlated electronic phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal Lepek, Kordian Makulski, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak</p>
            <p>In this article, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the fractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that impose a predetermined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified by their nearest local hubs without enforcing rigid distance constraints. This flexibility leads to a key methodological shift: instead of fixing the box size in advance, we first determine the number of boxes and then compute their average size. We argue that this procedure is fully consistent with the recently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and closely related to the concept of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are embedded. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, but also (despite relaxing constraints on box diameter) covers networks using boxes of more similar sizes than, for instance, the classical greedy coloring (GC) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze nine complex networks (three model-based and six real-world) representing a broad spectrum: from networks with confirmed fractality, through those with initially uncertain, but here confirmed, fractal properties (such as the Internet at the level of autonomous systems), to large-scale networks that have so far remained beyond the reach of existing algorithms due to their size.</p>

            <p>CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate. This work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent conduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck thermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and by electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a multicarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands dominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore, DFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi level and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is experimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped Cr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable electronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in devices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</p>

            <p>Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Banik Rai, Nitesh Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusplike feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this article, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the nonorthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, nonorthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a nonorthogonal external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Many-body localization in a slowly varying potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Jian Li, Yi-Ting Tu, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0<s<1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV and QP models may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-projected wave function methods capture static correlation by breaking and restoring the symmetries of a system. In this article, we present the symmetry-projected spin antisymmetrized geminal power (spin-AGP) state projected onto space group symmetry as well as complex conjugation, spin-flip, and time-reversal symmetries.

            <h2>Uncertainty-aware electronic density-functional distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teitur Hansen, Jens Jørgen Mortensen, Thomas Bligaard, Karsten Wedel Jacobsen</p>
            <p>We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.</p>

            <p>Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow dynamics below their melting temperatures, maintaining an amorphous structure reminiscent of normal liquids. Distinguishing microscopic structures in the supercooled and high-temperature regimes remains a debated topic. Building on recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our study automatically extracts features, unveiling fundamental mechanisms driving structural changes at varying temperatures. We employ the self-attention mechanism to generate attention coefficients that quantify the importance of connections between graph nodes, providing insights into the rationale behind GNN predictions. Exploring structural changes with decreasing temperature through the GNN+self-attention using physically-defined structural descriptors, including the bond-orientational order parameter, Voronoi cell volume, and coordination number, we identify strong correlations between high attention coefficients and more disordered structures as a key indicator of variations in glass-forming liquids.</p>

            <p>Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer-breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moiré superlattices. The dislocations, forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers, bring about spatial modulation of the interlayer distance, generating effective potentials that promote the emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer-breathing modes inside perfect dislocations. For parallel MX$_2$ bilayers, perfect dislocations host multiple quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains. In contrast, antiparallel bilayers exhibit only a single quasi-bound band arising for orientations close to the edge-dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar</p>
            <p>On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM finding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared wavelength range.</p>

            <p>The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</p>

            <p>Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.</p>

            <h2>Canonical Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaldo Spalvieri</p>
            <p>In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.</p>

            <h2>Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c \equiv H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis described by the $N$-spin Curie-Weiss model where $N^{-1/2}\sim\sigma$. Our work provides a panoramic view of finite-time scalings of the hysteresis phenomenon, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Ontological differentiation as a measure of semantic accuracy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Garcia-Cuadrillero, Fabio Revuelta, Jose Angel Capitan</p>
            <p>Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across ~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sameer Kumar, Niels de Graaf Sousa, Amin Doostmohammadi</p>
            <p>The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.</p>

            <p>In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.</p>

When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p>We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</p>

The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</p>

            <p>Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Di Lucente, Francesco Libbi, Nicola Marzari</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.</p>

            <p>The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We benchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG establishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations. These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science. The OMatG code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kordian Makulski, Mateusz Samsel, Michal Lepek, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak</p>
            <p>This paper presents a versatile model for generating fractal complex networks that closely mirror the properties of real-world systems. By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man-made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and scale-invariant properties of hierarchically nested boxes. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorporates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model's applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks.</p>

            <h2>Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nils O. Winkler, Oliver M. Drozdowski, Falko Ziebert, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)</p>
            <p>Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. Exploring parameter space beyond the isoform parameters typical for animal cells, we also find cell oscillations in length and velocity, which might be realized for genetically engineered systems. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit, which then is used to calculate a state diagram, and the effect of actin polymerization at the boundaries, that leads to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.</p>

            <h2>Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz J. Samsel, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak</p>
            <p>We investigate the full temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks, focusing on the susceptible-infected (SI) model of disease transmission. Combining theoretical analysis with large-scale numerical simulations, we uncover two universal patterns of epidemic growth, determined by the structure of the underlying network. In small-world networks, the prevalence follows a Gompertz-like curve, while in fractal networks it evolves according to Avrami-type dynamics, which is typical of spatially constrained systems. These regimes define distinct universality classes that remain robust across arbitrary transmission rates. Notably, our approach provides explicit analytical formulas for the global epidemic prevalence and class-specific scaling relations capturing its dependence on the transmission rate. We show that the commonly assumed early exponential growth occurs only in small-world networks, where it corresponds to the short-time approximation of the Gompertz function. In contrast, this exponential phase is entirely absent in fractal networks, where spreading is markedly slower and governed by different mechanisms. Our approach clarifies the structural origins of these contrasting behaviors and offer a unified framework for understanding epidemic dynamics across diverse network topologies.</p>

            <h2>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz</p>
            <p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p>

            <h2>Towards a multi-dimensional picture of nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijian Wu, Thomas Philippe, Aymane Graini, Julien Lam</p>
            <p>While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) often fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event emphasizing the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</p>

            <h2>Coherence-decoherence interplay in quantum systems due to projective stochastic pulses: The case of Rabi oscillations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sushanta Dattagupta, Shamik Gupta</p>
            <p>The interplay of coherence and decoherence is played out in a three-level quantum system, in which the third level is incoherently coupled to the second one which itself is in coherent interaction with the first level. The study is based on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the system is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the absence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution restricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the second level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions between the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing non-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The pulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as random variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A representative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator mimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an analytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator. When the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal behavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that the system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the quantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At short times $t \ll 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average frequency at which pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate. Consequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At long times $t \gg 1/\lambda$, decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form $P_1(t) \sim \exp(-\lambda t)$.</p>

            <h2>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon B. Le, Dima Watkins</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the "destructive interference" of many connected neurons and miniature "phase transitions" from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse</p>
            <p>We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell > r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell>r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Majorana edge reconstruction and the $ν=5/2$ non-Abelian thermal Hall puzzle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tevž Lotrič, Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel, Steven H. Simon, S. A. Parameswaran</p>
            <p>Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer $\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Finite-temperature criticality through quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Teza, Francesco Campaioli, Marco Avesani, Oren Raz</p>
            <p>Critical phenomena at finite temperature underpin a broad range of physical systems, yet their study remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks near phase transitions. Quantum annealers have attracted significant interest as a potential tool for accessing finite temperature criticality beyond classical reach, but their utility in precisely resolving criticality has remained limited by noise, hardware constraints, and thermal fluctuations. Here we overcome these challenges, showing that careful calibration and embedding allow quantum annealers to capture the full finite-temperature critical behavior of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. By tuning the energy scale of the system and mitigating device asymmetries, we sample effective Boltzmann distributions and extract both the critical temperature and the associated critical exponents. Our approach opens the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium critical phenomena in a broad class of systems at finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peizhi Mai</p>
            <p>Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.</p>

            <h2>Correlated quantum shift vector of particle-hole excitations</h2>

            <p>Excitons are a prime example of how electron interactions affect optical response and excitation. We demonstrate that, beyond its spectra, the bound nature of an exciton's electron-hole pair produces a correlated quantum geometry: excitonic excitations possess a quantum shift vector that is independent of light polarization. We find this counterintuitive behavior has dramatic consequences for geometric response: e.g., in noncentrosymmetric but non-polar materials, vertical excitonic transitions possess vanishing shift vector zeroing their shift photocurrent; this contrasts with finite and strongly light polarization dependent shift vectors for non-interacting delocalized particle-hole excitations. This dichotomy makes shift vector a sharp diagnostic of the pair localization properties of particle-hole excitations and demonstrates the non-perturbative effects of electron interactions in excited state quantum geometric response.</p>

            <p>Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement. Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations in strongly coupled systems.</p>

            <p>We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</p>

            <p>The coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity in ferroelectric (FE) metals defies conventional wisdom and enables novel functionalities in electronic and optoelectronic systems. However, intrinsic FE metals remain extremely rare and challenging. Here, using first-principles calculations, we identify that a huge spontaneous polarization of 16.6-20.2 $\mu\text{C}/\text{cm}^2$, a moderate switching barrier of 68.5 meV/f.u., and a low carrier concentration of $ \sim 2.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ coexist in topological semimetal EuAuBi. Further electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that the metallic carriers interact weakly with the FE phonon mode, consistent with the decoupled electron mechanism. Moreover, EuAuBi exhibits a pronounced bulk photovoltaic effect characterized by a giant polarization-dependent shift current with the magnitude of conductivity up to 370 $\mu\text{A}/\text{V}^2$. Thus, a feasible FE metal verification setup is proposed based on the shift current measurement. These results not only demonstrate that EuAuBi is a promising FE metal, but also propose a practical route for FE metals identification, which could promote the FE metals study greatly.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.</p>

While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes. Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point, excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the increased role of quantum fluctuations.</p>

Observations of this unconventional form of superconductivity are unfortunately still very limited, and significant efforts are being made to search for candidate materials. Most existing theoretical studies focus on systems with strictly non-dispersive bands, which, from an experimental point of view, represents an extremely difficult technological constraint to achieve. It is therefore crucial to understand to what extent this constraint can be relaxed. In other words, to what extent can superconductivity in flat bands survive weak perturbations?

            <p>The tribological performance of 2D materials makes them good candidates toward a reduction of friction at the macroscale. Superlubricity has been observed for graphene, MoS\textsubscript{2} and MXenes and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is used to reduce or tune friction, but other materials are investigated as potential candidates for low-lubricity applications. Specifically, borophene is predicted to have ultra-low friction. Here, we experimentally investigate frictional properties of borophene and use a borophene-hBN lateral heterostructure to directly compare the tribological properties of the two complementary 2D materials. In particular, we investigate the friction between a sliding tip and (i) the weakly corrugated $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene layer on Ir(111) or (ii) the hBN/Ir(111) superlattice structures with a strongly corrugated moiré reconstruction. Our experimental study performed in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature combined with a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model calculation confirms the superlubricity predicted for borophene, while hBN, which exhibits a higher friction, is nevertheless confirmed as a low friction material. Ab initio calculations show that the lower friction of $\mathcal{X}_6$-borophene with respect to hBN can be rationalized by weaker tip/surface interactions. In addition, we assess structural and electrical properties of borophene and hBN by using scanning probe techniques and compare their dissipation under the oscillating tip to investigate the possible path of energy dissipation occurring during friction. Our study demonstrates the low frictional properties of borophene and the potential of lateral heterostructure investigations to directly compare the properties of these 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Muonium (Mu), a bound state of a positively charged muon and an electron, can diffuse through crystal lattices and interact with defect centers in insulators and semiconductors. We demonstrate that this Mu's diffusive property can be used to probe defects in a diamond crystal lattice; specifically, substitutional nitrogen atoms (N$_\text{s}^0$) and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in type-Ib diamond. Upon interaction with these defects, Mu can exchange its electron's spin or change its charge state, which result in muon spin relaxation. However, muons in diamond (and semiconductors in general) can be in a few distinctive muonium states, with each state contributing to the muon signal. In addition, these states can undergo site and charge exchange interaction, forming a dynamic network. Hence, to study the Mu interaction with point defects, the muon data have to be deconvoluted to isolate signals from the diffusing species. To achieve this goal, we have modeled the Mu state exchange dynamics and numerically simulated the time evolution of muon spin polarization by the density matrix method. With a global curve fit to a set of longitudinal field scan data, one can extract the Mu transition rates that involve interaction with the defect centers. The diffusing tetrahedral interstitial Mu was found to interact with the paramagnetic N$_\text{s}^0$ center via electron spin exchange. In contrast, they are converted to form a diamagnetic center upon interaction with the negatively charged NV center.</p>

            <p>Local strain engineering is a promising technique to tune the properties of two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. However, many existing methods are static and limit the systematic exploration of strain-dependent material behavior. Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS}_2$) via nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Hyperuniformity at the Absorbing State Transition: Perturbative RG for Random Organization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Ma, Johannes Pausch, Gunnar Pruessner, Michael E. Cates</p>
            <p>Hyperuniformity, where the static structure factor obeys $S(q)\sim q^{\varsigma}$ with $\varsigma> 0$, emerges at criticality in systems having multiple, symmetry-unrelated, absorbing states. Important examples arise in periodically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids; these lie in the random organisation (RO) universality class, for which analytic results for $\varsigma$ are lacking. Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory and perturbative RG about a Gaussian model, we find $\varsigma = 0^+$ and $\varsigma= 2\epsilon/9 + O(\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d>d_c=4$ and $d=4-\epsilon$ respectively. Our calculations assume that renormalizability is sustained via a certain pattern of cancellation of strongly divergent terms. These cancellations allow the upper critical dimension to remain $d_c = 4$, as is known for RO, while generic perturbations (e.g., those violating particle conservation) would typically flow to a fixed point with $d_c=6$. The assumed cancellation pattern is closely reminiscent of a long-established one near the tricritical Ising fixed point. (This has $d_c=3$, although generic perturbations flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with $d_c = 4$.) We show how hyperuniformity in RO emerges from anticorrelation of strongly fluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield the remaining exponents to order $\epsilon$, surprisingly without recourse to functional RG. These exponents coincide as expected with the Conserved Directed Percolation (C-DP) class which also contains the Manna Model and the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (q-EW) model. Importantly however, our $\varsigma$ differs from one found via a mapping to q-EW. That mapping neglects a conserved noise in the RO action, which we argue to be dangerously irrelevant. Thus, although other exponents are common to both, the RO and C-DP universality classes have different exponents for hyperuniformity.</p>

            <h2>The effect of fiber plasticity on domain formation in soft biological composites -- Part I: a bifurcation analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Agoras, Fernanda F. Fontenele, Nikolaos Bouklas</p>
            <p>The main objective of this work is to shed light on the effect of fiber plasticity on the macroscopic response and domain formation in soft biological composites. This goal is pursued by analyzing the plane-strain response of two-phase laminates. In the context of this problem, the effect of fiber plasticity is accounted for by allowing the elastically stiffer layers (``fiber'' phase) to also yield plastically and by taking the soft layers (``matrix'' phase) to be purely elastic solids. The analysis is carried out at finite elastic and plastic strains, but it is restricted to unidirectional, non-monotonic loading paths, applied by initially increasing the macroscopic stretch along the direction of the layers up to a prescribed maximum value and then decreasing the same stretch down to a minimum value. A simple expression is derived for the critical conditions at which the homogenized behavior of the laminate loses strong ellipticity for the first time along the loading path. The relevance of this result stems from the fact that the loss of macroscopic ellipticity of these composites is known to coincide with the onset of bifurcations of the long-wavelength type. It follows from this result that, just like hyperelastic laminates, elastoplastic laminates may lose macroscopic ellipticity whenever their incremental strength in shear perpendicular to the layers vanishes for the first time. For situations in which loss of macroscopic ellipticity does take place, a corresponding post-bifurcation solution for the homogenized behavior of the laminate is computed. The deformed state of the material described by this solution is characterized by twin lamellar domains that are formed at a length scale much larger than the width of the original, microscopic layers, but still much smaller than the overall dimensions of the macroscopic specimen under consideration.</p>

            <p>We report on the temperature-dependent optical response of thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (YBCO) in the visible spectral range under cryogenic conditions. Specifically, we observe an increase in transmittance near the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), which saturates within a few kelvins below Tc. The increase in transmittance is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in reflectance as the temperature drops below Tc, and both quantities track the superconducting phase transition. Changes in transmittance are found to be wavelength dependent, with the maximum variation occurring at 633 nm and minimal at 450 nm. These observations establish a correlation between the variation in optical response and the superconducting phase transition, even in the visible regime. The results of our experiment highlight the potential for using non-contact optical measurements to determine Tc. The effect can be explained using the two-fluid model, which can account for the observed temperature and wavelength dependence of the transmittance of the superconducting thin films.</p>

            <h2>Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel</p>
            <p>Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less than $1\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.</p>

            <h2>Phase Stability and Transformations in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites from Machine Learning Force Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia Liang, Johan Klarbring, Aron Walsh</p>
            <p>Lead halide perovskites (APbX$_3$) offer tunable optoelectronic properties but feature an intricate phase-stability landscape. Here we employ on-the-fly data collection and an equivariant message-passing neural-network potential to perform large-scale molecular dynamics of three prototypical perovskite systems: CsPbX$_3$, MAPbX$_3$, and FAPbX$_3$. Integrating these simulations with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively "forbids" the beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$ tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement $\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\unicode{x2013}$ alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution, offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved phase stability.</p>

            <p>Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$. Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free, geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</p>

            <h2>Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Chaduteau, Derek K. K. Lee, Frank Schindler</p>
            <p>The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alfredo Scigliani, Hadi Mohammadigoushki</p>
            <p>We report the flow dynamics of two shear-banding wormlike micellar solutions with distinct surfactant chemistries in a Taylor-Couette (TC) setup following a startup shear. The solutions, formulated with CTAB/NaSal and CPyCl/NaSal, exhibit comparable bulk rheology and equilibrium microstructural properties. By varying the TC gap size, we systematically examine elasticity number over a range of 128000-4470000, while flow curvature spans from 0.022 to 0.171. Under a step shear into the stress plateau, both solutions exhibit a pronounced stress overshoot that intensifies with increasing elasticity number and flow curvature, followed by the development of growing flow heterogeneities. Beyond a critical threshold of elasticity number and curvature, the CTAB/NaSal solution exhibits transient flow reversal, whereas the CPyCl/NaSal solution, despite developing similar heterogeneities, does not undergo flow reversal under any tested conditions. We hypothesize that this difference arises from the stronger electrostatic repulsions between CPyCl head groups due to their larger size, coupled with the higher dissociation rate of Cl counterions. Additionally, the quasi-steady velocity profiles are significantly influenced by elasticity number and flow curvature. Wall slip at the outer cylinder exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on these parameters: it is negligible at low values of elasticity number and flow curvature, peaks at intermediate values, and diminishes at high values. Our findings highlight how surfactant chemistry, elasticity number, and flow curvature control shear-banding flows in wormlike micelles.</p>

            <p>We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.</p>

            <p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ansätze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo Menesse, Ana P. Millán, Joaquín J. Torres</p>
            <p>The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms, the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest recurrent circuits.</p>

            <p>Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across chemically diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, the accuracy and utility of these models have been assessed relying on descriptors based on formation energies or idealized harmonic atomic vibrations. Yet, the rigorous and physically interpretable quantification of their capability to describe both realistic anharmonic atomic dynamics and technologically relevant observables remains a pressing problem. Here, we address this problem, leveraging the Wigner formulation of heat transport and the Grüneisen approach to thermal expansion to connect the atomic-physics awareness of foundation models to their utility in predicting experimentally observable thermomechanical properties, presenting standards and fine-tuning protocols needed to achieve first-principles accuracy. We apply our framework to a database of 103 solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating that it overcomes the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials -- high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness -- and its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</p>

The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.</p>

            <p>The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged solvent-in-salt states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.</p>

            <p>Lifshitz invariant is a symmetry invariant composed of multiple order parameters that contain a single spatial derivative in a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy, which may induce a nonuniform configuration of the order parameters. In multiband superconductors, we find phase transitions from a uniform superconducting state to qualitatively distinct two pair-density-wave (PDW) states with small and large momenta $\boldsymbol{q}$ based on the GL theory. The former is induced by the Lifshitz invariant, while the latter originates from the drag effect. In the PDW states, the Higgs and Leggett modes (i.e., collective amplitude and relative phase oscillations of the order parameters) are shown to couple to electromagnetic fields linearly. We construct microscopic models of multiband superconductors with Lifshitz invariant that exhibit PDW states, and calculate the linear optical conductivity using the diagrammatic approach. We find optically active Higgs and Leggett modes in the small $\boldsymbol{q}$ PDW state, indicating that the PDW state is a suitable platform to explore collective modes of multiband superconductors in the linear response regime.</p>

            <p>We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.</p>

            <p>In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local level, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the formation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of self-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and some types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active phase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium case, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has recently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance, although it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (for example domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can in other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For example, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a process that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other new phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial tension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created by active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions governing different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena can be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single conserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a velocity field in cases where momentum conservation is also present. More complex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters (especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order parameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics; or in systems that support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting phases.

            <h2>Wannier interpolation of spin accumulation coefficient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atsuo Shitade, Emi Minamitani</p>
            <p>The spin Hall (SH) effect is widely understood as a phenomoenon in which spin current flows perpendicular to an electric field. In the presence of a spin-orbit coupling, however, spin current is ambiguous, and the SH conductivity depends on the definition of spin current. In this article, we develop an \textit{ab initio} computational scheme for the spin accumulation coefficient, which characterizes the spin accumulation and would be an alternative indicator of the SH effect. The proposed method has been implemented into an open-source software Wannier90 and serves high-precision \textit{ab initio} research on the SH effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sára Lévay, Philippe Claudin, Ellák Somfai, Tamás Börzsönyi</p>
            <p>We perform discrete element method (DEM) simulations of elongated grains in a shear cell for various particle aspect ratios and contact frictions, with an additional heterogeneous force perturbation in the flow direction. For a perturbation in the form of a single Fourier mode, we show that the response of the system consists of transverse secondary flows that average onto a pattern of four vortices. We also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.</p>

            <p>Our study explores the mixture of polar particles in apolar environment. We employ a coarse-grained approach to model the mixture, where polar particles are in minority. The interaction between polar and apolar components is incorporated via a coupling term in the free energy. Coupling generates local interaction in the system which results in the formation of string like structures connecting a pair of half integer topological defects. The increase in the coupling strength or the density of polar particles results in the: Sharper strings with larger probability of connecting the topological defects of same charge and the enhanced dynamics of topological defects. However, the ordering kinetics of the system shows the delayed coarsening for larger coupling or polar density. Our results can be used to develop controlled kinetics as well as to detect the impurities in liquid crystals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Terasawa, Yukiyasu Ozeki</p>
            <p>To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</p>

            <p>Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.</p>

            <p>We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions occur. By mapping this Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical results for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial expansions, and the high-pressure regime. In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. We also examine spatial correlations in particle arrangements and radial fluctuations, shedding light on the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</p>

            <p>This study presents a sustainable approach to synthesize bio-graphite from Pterocarpus marsupium (Indian Kino) leaves without using chemical catalysts, activating agents, or organic solvents. The resulting bio-graphite was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a modified Hummers method. The bio-graphite derived rGO was further incorporated with orthorhombic structured MoO$_3$ at different percentages (1, 3, and 6 wt.%) using ultrasonication. Structural, morphological, and functional characterizations were conducted using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, revealing a bandgap of 2.82 eV for the rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ composite. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated via methylene blue degradation under natural sunlight. The rGO(3 wt.%)-MoO$_3$ nanocomposite showed superior performance, achieving 90% degradation in 150 minutes when compared to 65% by pure MoO$_3$. The Scavenger tests confirmed superoxide radicals $(\cdot O_2^-)$ as the main reactive species. This work highlights the potential of bio-graphite derived rGO-MoO$_3$ nanocomposites as efficient, eco-friendly photocatalysts for wastewater treatment.</p>

            <p>We propose a lattice model for the realization of exotic quartic semi-Dirac fermions, i.e. quasiparticles exhibiting a dispersion with quartic momentum dependence in a given direction, and a linear dependence in the perpendicular direction. A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce short range electron-electron interactions which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase. Without interactions, or in the presence of long range correlations, the lattice is unstable towards formation of either anisotropic Dirac cones, or simple (quadratic) semi-Dirac phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeseok Hur, Meesoon Ha, Hawoong Jeong</p>
            <p>Economic inequality is driven by the structure of agent networks, interactions among agents, and the abilities of individual agents. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where heterogeneous agent abilities and growth rates are tuned on sparse regular networks. In particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary M Raines, Andrey V Chubukov</p>
            <p>We study superconductivity in paramagnetic and ferromagnetically-ordered phases in a two-dimensional electron system with parabolic fermionic dispersion and short-range repulsive interaction. In the paramagnetic phase, we find that a weak momentum dependence of a paramagnon propagator parametrically reduces the onset temperature for the pairing compared to that in phenomenological theories which assume a strong dispersion of a paramagnon and also changes the topology of the gap function. In the ferromagnetic phase, we show that the order instantly polarizes low-energy fermionic excitations. We derive the fully renormalized pairing interaction between low-energy fermions, mediated by two transverse Goldstone modes and show that it is attractive in a spatially-odd channel. The pairing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase is found to be a fraction of the Fermi energy, significantly larger than in the paramagnetic phase near the transition. Our results are relevant for understanding superconductivity in proximity to itinerant ferromagnetism in multi-valley graphene systems, particularly the ones with full valley and spin polarization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Seung-Cheol Lee</p>
            <p>The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>A new class of optical quasiparticles called magnetic excitons recently emerged in magnetic van der Waals materials. Akin to the highly effective strategies developed for electrons, the strong interactions of these excitons with the spin degree of freedom may provide innovative solutions for long-standing challenges in optics, such as steering the flow of energy and information. Here, we demonstrate transport of excitons by spin excitations in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Key results of our study are the observations of ultrafast, nearly isotropic exciton propagation substantially enhanced at the Neel temperature, transient contraction and expansion of the exciton clouds at low temperatures, as well as superdiffusive behavior in bilayer samples. These signatures largely defy description by commonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of incoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the drag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic properties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons. The universal nature of the underlying exciton-magnon scattering promises driving of excitons by magnons in other magnetic semiconductors and even in non-magnetic materials by proximity in heterostructures, merging the rich physics of magneto-transport with optics and photonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avishek Das, Pieter Rein ten Wolde</p>
            <p>The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being widely researched for their interesting electronic properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical and thermal properties can be finely modulated using a variety of methods, including strain, passivation, doping, and tuning of defect density. However, measuring defect densities, such as those associated with vacancy-type point defects, is inherently very difficult in atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure defect density in ~15x20$\mu$m monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, favourable signal scaling with lateral resolution makes wafer-scale characterisation immediately possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anne Matthies, Nicolas Dannenfeld, Silvia Pappalardi, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study both numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators that can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic decay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical predictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy between analytics and the finite-size numerical data.</p>

In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</p>

            <p>We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the AC field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</p>

Using the generalized Aubry-André model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p>Controlling spin currents in topological insulators (TIs) is crucial for spintronics but challenged by the robustness of their chiral edge states, which impedes the spin manipulation required for devices like spin-field effect transistors (SFETs). We theoretically demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by synergistically applying circularly polarized light and gate-tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (rSOC) to a 2D TI. Laser irradiation provides access to Floquet sidebands where rSOC induces controllable spin precession, leading to the generation of one-way, switchable spin-polarized photocurrents, an effect forbidden in equilibrium TIs. This mechanism effectively realizes SFET functionality within a driven TI, specifically operating within a distinct Floquet replica, offering a new paradigm for light-based control in topological spintronics.</p>

            <p>Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the Néel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.</p>

In exploring the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC based on Josephson trijunctions constructed on topological insulators, the expected Majorana phase diagram of a single trijunction has been experimentally verified. If Majorana zero modes indeed exist in this kind of trijunctions, coupling between them in multiple trijunction devices would be further expected. In this study, we fabricated Josephson devices containing two adjacent Josephson trijunctions on the surface of Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3, and observed that the minigap reopens for both trijunctions in their phase spaces where a closure would otherwise be expected if the trijunctions existed independently.

            <p>Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p>

            <h2>The quantum Mpemba effect in long-range spin systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shion Yamashika, Filiberto Ares</p>
            <p>One of the manifestations of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is that a tilted ferromagnet exhibits faster restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry after a quantum quench when starting from a larger tilt angle. This phenomenon has recently been observed experimentally in an ion trap that simulates a long-range spin chain. However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the presence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent spin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We show that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of symmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the QME. We find that this effect occurs across a wide parameter range in long-range systems, in contrast to its absence in some short-range counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of the flux-free sector of the Kitaev honeycomb against environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Sattler, Maria Daghofer</p>
            <p>The Kitaev honeycomb model (KHM) consists of spin-$1/2$ particles on a honeycomb lattice with direction-dependent Ising-like interactions. It can alternatively be described in terms of non-interacting Majorana fermions, can be solved exactly, and has a quantum spin-liquid ground state. Open boundaries then host Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that are robust against some types of disorder. We analyze the fate of the MZMs when they couple to an environment via a Lindblad master equation. By computing the time evolution of the density matrix, we find that when decoherence occurs, the steady state is mostly the maximally mixed state. Among the few exceptions is a parameter regime that realizes the superconducting Kitaev chain model with periodic boundary conditions. We consistently observe a quantum Zeno effect in the density matrix as well as in the entropy and fidelity, while it is not found in the energy gap of some gapped spin liquids. We thus present a comprehensive overview over MZMs coupled to a spin bath that is relevant to proposals to detect MZMs of Kitaev layers on surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

            <p>The identification of high-temperature unconventional charge order and superconductivity in kagome quantum materials is pivotal for deepening our understanding of geometrically frustrated and correlated electron systems, and for harnessing their exotic properties in future quantum technologies. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkably rich phase diagram in the kagome superconductor YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, uncovered through a unique combination of muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), magnetotransport, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study reveals the emergence of a charge-ordered state with a propagation vector of (1/2, 0, 0), setting a record onset temperature of 800 K for such an order in a kagome system and for quantum materials more broadly. In addition, we observe time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking below $T_{2}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 25 K and field-induced magnetism below $T_{1}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 90 K, indicating the presence of a hidden magnetic state. These transitions are mirrored in the magnetoresistance data, which show a clear onset at ${\sim}$ $T_{1}^{*}$ and a pronounced increase below ${\sim}$ $T_{2}^{*}$, ultimately reaching a maximum magnetoresistance of 45${\%}$. Band structure calculations identify two van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level, one of which resides within a flat band, suggesting a strong interplay between electronic correlations and emergent orders. At low temperatures, we find bulk superconductivity below $T_{\rm c}$ = 3.4 K, characterized by a pairing symmetry with either two isotropic full gaps or an anisotropic nodeless gap. Together, our findings point to a coexistence of high-temperature charge order, tunable magnetism, and multigap superconductivity in YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, positioning it as a compelling platform for exploring correlated kagome physics.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials with novel spin textures from strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential components for a wide array of proposed spintronic devices. Topological insulators have necessary strong SOC that imposes a unique spin texture on topological states and Rashba states that arise on the boundary, but there is no established methodology to control the spin texture reversibly. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing Bi2Se3 films by altering the step-edge termination directly changes the strength of SOC and thereby modifies the Rashba strength of 1D edge states. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy shows that these Rashba edge states arise and subsequently vanish through the Se functionalization and reduction process of the step edges. The observations are corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which show that a subtle chemical change of edge termination fundamentally alters the underlying electronic structure. Importantly, we experimentally demonstrated fully reversible and repeatable switching of Rashba edge states across multiple cycles at room temperature. The results imply Se functionalization as a practical method to control SOC and spin texture of quantum states in topological insulators.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

            <h2>Unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in plasmonic photocatalysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Chen, Shengxiang Wu, Shiwu Gao</p>
            <p>The damping of surface plasmons generates hot carriers, which holds promise for photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis. Recent studies have revealed the nonequilibrium characters of the plasmonic hot carriers and their nonadiabatic coupling to molecular vibrations. Yet, the precise mechanism of plasmonic photocatalysis remains elusive and controversial. Here, we present a unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in the dynamics of vibrational excitation and photodissocation, where a quantitative comparison between the two mechanisms can be made. We revisit a well-studied system, O$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoparticles. The nonthermal hot carriers are found to promote molecular dissociation in the low-temperature or high-intensity regime. With increasing laser intensity, the dissociation rate exhibits a transition from a linear to nonlinear dependence due to the onset of vibrational heating as observed in experiment. Our model provides a unified framework to understand the mechanism and dynamics of photocatalysis and reveals the nonthermal pathways for energy harvesting and conversion with surface plasmons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Yves Desaules, Thomas Iadecola, Jad C. Halimeh</p>
            <p>Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagomé geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moiré TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.</p>

            <p>A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Qi, Ramanjit Sohal, Xie Chen, David T. Stephen, Abhinav Prem</p>
            <p>Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory for the pseudogap and the transition to $d$-wave superconductivity in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).</p>

We identify multiple topological phase transitions between magic angles, driven by band inversions at high-symmetry points in momentum space. Notably, the central bands can exhibit phases with Chern numbers C = 2, revealing previously unreported topological states in TBG.</p>

            <p>It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.</p>

            <p>Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling in the conventional sense requires that the Rabi cycling process between two interacting states is faster than other dissipation rates. Some recent experimental findings show intriguing properties that were attributed to polaritonic states (e.g., plexcitons) even though the above criterion is not satisfied. Here, we theoretically predict and provide experimental evidence of polariton-like behavior in a system that does not show Rabi splitting. The photoluminescence of an exciton-cavity system consisting of a two-dimensional exciton monolayer (tungsten disulfide, WS2) coupled to a planar, open, one-mirror optical cavity configuration is studied. We experimentally observed a transition from the weak coupling regime crossing an exceptional point to form polariton-like states by varying the coupling strength and the cavity loss. Our observations are fully in agreement with a theoretical quasi-normal mode analysis, which predicts this transition and confirms the presence of exceptional points in the system. These results provide evidence that polaritonic effects can be experimentally observed even when the conventional strong coupling condition is not satisfied.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay of superconductivity and magnetic disorder has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a fully self-consistent calculation of the complex renormalization by exchange interactions and hence the complete phase diagram of conventional $s$-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities as well as the related physical properties including the optical response. We show that a small amount of magnetic disorder can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state, where the single-particle excitation gap vanishes whereas the superconducting order parameter $\Delta_0$ remains finite. In this phase, the linear optical conductivity exhibits a finite absorption over the low-frequency regime, particularly for photon energies below the conventional threshold $2|\Delta_0|$, even at low temperatures, in sharp contrast to the gapped state. The nonlinear response, however, remains coherent and is dominated by the Higgs-mode dynamics rather than gapless quasiparticle background. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between dissipative single-particle excitations and coherent collective dynamics of the condensate, a feature likely general to other gapless superconductors, and introduces a fundamentally different detection scheme, using THz spectroscopy to probe the signatures of Shiba states.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism-induced non-collinear superconducting diode effect and unidirectional superconducting transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene, forming moiré superlattices, possesses distinct electronic and optical properties derived from the hybridization of energy band and the emergence of van Hove singularities depending on its twist angle. Extensive research has been conducted on the global characteristics of moiré superlattice induced by long-range periodicity. However, limited attention has been given to the local properties within a moiré unit cell, which undoubtedly differ due to the variations in three-dimensional atomic arrangement. Here we demonstrate the highly localized excitations of carbon 1s electrons to unoccupied van Hove singularities in a twisted bilayer graphene using an electron energy loss spectroscopy based on a monochromated transmission electron microscope. The core-level excitations associated with the van Hove singularities show a systematic twist angle dependence which is analogous to the optical excitations. Furthermore, local variations in those core-level van Hove singularity peaks within a moiré unit cell have been corroborated for the first time, which can originate from core-exciton lifetimes and band modifications influenced by the local stacking geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Barresi, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of quantum vortex dipoles in a strongly interacting, spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid at zero temperature. Using fully microscopic time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that the dipole trajectory is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of spin polarization. The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal (dissipative) and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous condensates.</p>

            <p>Chiral superconductors are sought after for their promising but elusive Majorana zero modes. We show that a one-dimensional semiconductor in proximity to a conventional superconductor and a helical magnet can exhibit chiral superconductivity, without the need for external magnetic fields or intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. The effective proximity-induced gap and the triplet gap arising from magnon fluctuations can be made to interfere constructively. The heterostructure can be tuned into a topological regime with Majorana zero modes at its ends, over a range of chemical potentials proportional to the spin-electron coupling.</p>

            <h2>Light Induced Half-Metallic Phase in Insulators and Correlated Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suryashekhar Kusari, Arnab Das, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Arti Garg</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filiberto Ares, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese</p>
            <p>We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show, using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David X. Horvath, Benjamin Doyon, Paola Ruggiero</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol. Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results. In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first cumulants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Méndez, R. Flaquer-Galmés</p>
            <p>We derive the characteristic function of stochastic functionals of a random walk whose position is reset to the origin at random times drawn from a general probability distribution. We analyze the long-time behavior and obtain the temporal scaling of the first two moments of any stochastic functional of the random walk when the resetting time distribution exhibits a power-law tail. When the resetting times PDF has finite moments, the probability density of any functional converges to a delta function centered at its mean, indicating an ergodic phase. We explicitly examine the case of the half-occupation time and derive the ergodicity breaking parameter, the first two moments, and the limiting distribution when the resetting time distribution follows a power-law tail, for both Brownian and subdiffusive random walks. We characterize the three different shapes of the limiting distribution as a function of the exponent of the resetting distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations, which show excellent agreement with the analytical results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov</p>
            <p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $-1/2<H<0$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</p>

            <p>In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p>

            <h2>New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Wong, Chiu Fan Lee</p>
            <p>The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Etienne Fodor</p>
            <p>In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which transition from a state of pure vertical motion to a horizontal diffusive state upon increased density. Depending on the details of the system, we observe both continuous and discontinuous transitions in numerical simulations. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to a coarse-grained model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</p>

            <p>Phyllosilicate clays have diverse applications in packaging industries and are found highly suitable for formulation, including thermoplastic starch (TPS), polyethylene (PE), or their combination. We developed CG MARTINI-3 parameters of the pyrophyllite using Lifshitz theory and experimental surface tension data. These initial bead assignments of pyrophyllite and periodic tetramethylammonium-montmorillonite (TMA-MMT) sheet were fine-tuned using optimal reproduction of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties obtained via all-atom (AA) simulation of TPS with a periodic pyrophyllite sheet. These developed models predicted the correct AA radial distribution function and two-body excess entropy for polymer-sorbitol pairs, showcasing the robustness of the developed CG model in predicting the properties not used in parameterization. These composite simulations revealed acceleration (for pyrophyllite) or retardation (for TMA-MMT) of khun segment dynamics (compared to melt) with the depletion of polymer near the surface. The developed CG parameters were used to investigate the long-time behavior of TPS-polyethylene (PE) melt and their Cloisite-15A-based composite systems. The coordination number indicated compatibilization of the TPS-PE phase, achieved by binding TPS through its bare polar surface and PE via alkyl-mediated interactions, which consequently reduced the TPS-PE interfacial surface tension from 45 mN/m to 13.06 mN/m. Additionally, high TPS-clay coordination, sustained localization of clay at the TPS-PE interface, and clay aggregation observed in CG simulation closely agree with experimental observations. Further, the CG model effectively captured the clay-mediated variation in the overall morphology of the TPS-PE system and their direct impact on chain conformational properties, making this CG model highly suitable for a material design perspective.</p>

            <p>Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</p>

            <p>We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean, macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</p>

            <p>We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries. The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong (non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis informed by the SymTFT framework.</p>

            <p>Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</p>

            <p>With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Metasurface with bound states in the continuum (BICs) offer exceptional potential for optical sensing due to their inherently high quality (Q) factors. However, the detection of symmetry-protected BICs remains experimentally challenging due to their non-radiative nature. Introducing slight asymmetry makes these resonances observable, though it reduces the Q-factor. In real devices, intrinsic material losses further affect the resonance behavior and sensing performance. While it is often assumed that sensing is optimized at the critical coupling when radiative and non-radiative losses are balanced, the precise conditions for achieving the best limit of detection (LOD) and figure-of-merit (FOM) remain under active discussion. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate BIC-based sensing in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate that the LOD exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on asymmetry, reaching an unexpected optimum where radiative and non-radiative losses are not equal. Moreover, we show that this optimum differs between reflection and transmission sensing schemes. Our results provide practical guidelines for optimizing Q-factor, sensitivity, and signal amplitude together, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of BIC-based sensing.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under Möbius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.</p>

Artificial magnetism and negative refractive index are two specific types of behavior that have been demonstrated over the past few years, illustrating the new physics and new applications possible when we expand our view as to what constitutes a material. In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research, and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agata Zdanowicz, Daniel Pęcak, Piotr Magierski, Gabriel Wlazłowski</p>
            <p>We present a new method for extracting a mass parameter using time-dependent density functional theory for an arbitrary physical system, provided the adiabatic limit is achievable. This approach works for collective variables also in the presence of a medium, in particular for the nuclei interacting with a neutron background. We apply the method to extract mass parameters of impurities in the neutron star crust, like their inertial masses and quadrupole mass parameters. The extracted mass parameters at various depths of the inner crust are compared with other methods, including the hydrodynamic approach. The presented method opens avenues for the construction of an effective model of neutron star crust grounded in microscopic calculations.</p>

            <p>Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as this http URL we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Hence they do not lead to a field-driven photocurrent individually, but when superposed can break individual symmetries and generate photocurrents. For unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase the tailored light exhibits TRS while breaking all other crystal symmetries, which imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems as we show both theoretically and experimentally. We employ state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liubov Gosteva, Marc Brachet, Léonie Canet</p>
            <p>Spectrally truncated three-dimensional (3D) Euler flows reach an absolute equilibrium. Yet they show non-trivial temporal correlations, similar to the ones of turbulent flows. In this work, we investigate Navier-Stokes equation in equilibrium conditions, both at finite viscosity and in the inviscid limit. We determine the space-time velocity correlations, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. We characterise the crossover in the dynamical scaling from $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$ at finite viscosity to $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ in the inviscid limit, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We show that, although the static properties of spectrally truncated Euler flows radically differ from their hydrodynamical limit, they share a similar emergent $k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling.</p>

            <p>We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.</p>

            <p>Short carbon atomic wires, the prototypes of the lacking carbon allotrope carbyne, represent the fundamental one-dimensional system and the first stage in carbon nanostructure growth, which still exhibits many open points regarding their growth and stability. We introduce an in situ UV resonance Raman approach for real-time monitoring of the growth of carbon atomic wires during pulsed laser ablation in liquid without perturbing the synthesis environment. We track single-chain species' growth dynamics, achieving size selectivity by exploiting the peculiar optoelectronic properties of carbon wires and the tunability of synchrotron radiation. We systematically explore diverse solvents, finding size- and solvent-dependent production rates linked to the solvent's C/H ratio and carbonization tendency. Carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics reveal a complex interplay between formation and degradation, leading to an equilibrium. Water, lacking in carbon atoms and reduced polyynes' solubility, yields fewer wires with rapid saturation. Organic solvents exhibit enhanced productivity and near-linear growth, attributed to additional carbon from solvent dissociation and low relative polarity. Exploring the dynamics of the saturation regime provides new insights into advancing carbon atomic wires' synthesis via PLAL. Understanding carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics can contribute to optimizing PLAL processes for nanomaterial synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Wave/particle duality in monitored Jaynes--Cummings resonances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance, arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation, at the expense of its temporal symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic Turbulence via an Instanton Gas Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Schorlepp, Katharina Kormann, Jeremiah Lübke, Tobias Schäfer, Rainer Grauer</p>
            <p>Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lebedev-Stepanov</p>
            <p>An analytical solution is obtained for the problem of the slow movement of a small drop of liquid in another immiscible liquid in an infinitely large reservoir with the boundary condition of partial slip at the liquid-liquid interface. That generalizes the conventional Navier condition of partial slip that given at the liquid-solid interface, since the solid (rigid) state can be considered as a liquid with infinite viscosity. A generalized Hadamard-Rybczynski equation (HRE) is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the conventional HRE. For infinite viscosity of the droplet, generalized HRE becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the all components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids, including diagonal tensor components. Generalized HRE is applied to the interpretation of the experiment in which the velocity of falling of a spherical droplet of silicate oil in the castor oil is investigated. Streamlines have been built corresponding to both the Hadamard-Rybczynski model and the partial slip approach. Presumably, the best applicability of the generalized HRE should be expected for the interface of hydrophobic liquid and hydrophilic one (water - hydrocarbons, water - higher alcohols, in general: aqueous emulsions, water - lipophilic organic liquids and oils, etc.). These are quite important emulsions in practical terms, for example, for the oil industry and medicine. Experimental methods for determining the slip length are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Fanfarillo, Gustavo Diez, Victor Gómez Mayordomo, Miguel Bosch, J. Ricardo Arias-Gonzalez, Belén Valenzuela</p>
            <p>We develop a microscopic model of perception of an interoceptive sensation in which spin-like variables encode an organism's internal evaluation of embodied vital norms associated with the sensation. Spins can take positive, negative, or neutral values. These local valorizations interact on a lattice embedded in the environmental context, and their collective configuration gives rise to a macroscopic perceptual state. By applying a coarse-graining procedure to a family of symmetric spin models, we derive a macroscopic Landau-type functional that makes explicit the mechanism by which key phenomenological features of perception, emerge from microscopic evaluative interactions. A central result is that the inclusion of a neutral evaluative state fundamentally alters the structure of the perceptual landscape, enhancing entropy, lowering the critical threshold, and increasing sensitivity to contextual input. These results establish a principled link between microscopic evaluative processes and large-scale perceptual organization, offering a flexible framework for integrating perceptual regulation and neurobiological modeling. The model integrates notions of neuroscience and cognitive science using the formalism of condensed matter field theory and providing novel theoretical insights and experimental predictions for conditions such as mental disorders and chronic pain.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase this http URL, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</p>

            <p>A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable, error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.</p>

Reports of one-dimensional defects hosting a Fermi liquid or a TLL have suggested a dependence on the underlying substrate, however, unveiling the physical details of electronic contributions from the substrate require cross-correlative investigation. Here, we study TLL formation within defectively engineered WS$_2$ atop graphene, where band structure and the atomic environment is visualized with nano angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and non-contact atomic force microscopy. Correlations between the local density of states and electronic band dispersion elucidated the electron transfer from graphene into a TLL hosted by one-dimensional metal (1DM) defects. It appears that the vertical heterostructure with graphene and the induced charge transfer from graphene into the 1DM is critical for the formation of a TLL.</p>

            <p>We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify. This emergence leads to a critical theory which seems to be different from those in the Ising universality class. Instead, within the data obtained from finite-size scaling analysis, we find the critical theory to be not inconsistent with Ashkin-Teller universality in the sense that the transitions of the model reproduces a critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$ close to unity. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>Materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to conduct heat away from hot spots in high power electronics and optoelectronic devices. Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has a high thermal conductivity due to its special phonon dispersion relation. Previous experimental studies of c-BAs report a room-temperature thermal conductivity between 1000 and 1300 W m-1 K-1. We synthesized high purity isotopically enriched c-BAs single crystals with room-temperature thermal conductivity of around 1500 W m-1 K-1. Using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), we measured thermal conductivity and found a 1/T2 temperature dependence between 300 K and 600 K - slightly stronger than predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models. Brillouin and Raman scattering revealed minimal changes in phonon frequencies over the same temperature range, suggesting that the observed 1/T2 dependence is not caused by temperature dependent changes in phonon dispersion. To probe defect densities in the BAs crystals we studied, we conducted transient reflectivity microscopy (TRM) measurements of absorption at sub-bandgap photon energies. We observe a correlation between TRM signal intensity and thermal conductivity. Notably, samples with thermal conductivity near 1500 W m-1 K-1 still exhibited nonzero TRM signals, suggesting the presence of defects despite the high thermal conductivity.</p>

            <p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles derived from natural cellulose, with potential applications ranging from rheological modifiers and emulsion stabilizers to photonic pigments and sensors. For most applications, precise control over CNC morphology and surface chemistry is essential, but the relationship between process parameters, CNC characteristics, and their resulting behavior is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of centrifugation and ionic strength on CNC morphology after dialysis using transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron diffraction. We find that the centrifugation step commonly applied during CNC purification promotes the formation of compact composite nanoparticles made of aligned crystallites, referred to as 'bundles', that are associated preferentially along their hydrophobic faces. In stark contrast, transient exposure to high ionic strength leads to fractal-like, irregular composite nanoparticles. We then examine the consequence of these morphological differences on the cholesteric self-organization of the CNCs: aligned bundles reduce the cholesteric pitch in suspension, causing a blue-shift in the color of dish-cast photonic films, while misaligned particles promote gelation, producing colorless films. This study reveals the importance of sample history, in particular, the often-disregarded purification steps, on CNC characteristics and their ensemble behavior, thereby unlocking new routes for tailoring this promising nanomaterial.</p>

            <p>The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a fingerprint in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.</p>

By expressing the proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show that the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a number-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit expressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the suitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to derive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Tanogami</p>
            <p>Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</p>

            <h2>Coadjoint-orbit bosonization of a Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengxing Ye, Yuxuan Wang</p>
            <p>We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</p>

            <p>An ensemble of electrons trapped above superfluid helium offers a paradigm system for investigating and controlling collective charge dynamics in low-dimensional electronic matter. Of particular interest is the ability to spatially control and engineer surface plasmons for integration with hybrid quantum systems and circuit quantum electrodynamic device architectures. Here we present experiments using an electron-on-helium microchannel device that hosts microwave-frequency plasmons, generated via local microwave excitation in an electrostatically defined central channel. By precisely varying the electron density, we demonstrate tunability of plasmon mode frequencies over several GHz. Additionally, we find that the power dependence of these modes can be used to investigate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources of spectral broadening. These results demonstrate the versatility of electrons on helium for probing collective excitations in low-dimensional Coulomb liquids and solids, and demonstrate a path for integrating engineered plasmons in electrons on helium with hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.</p>

            <h2>Slip-dominated structural transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanka Ghosh, Oguz Umut Salman, Sylvain Queyreau, Lev Truskinovsky</p>
            <p>We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</p>

            <p>We show that the remarkably small Fermi-liquid coherence scale and large effective mass observed in LiV$_2$O$_4$ are due to the proximity of a Hund-assisted orbital-selective Mott state. Our work is based on an ab initio dynamical mean-field approach, combining several quantum impurity solvers to capture the physics from high to very low temperature. We find that the Hund coupling plays a crucial role in rearranging the orbital populations and in generating the heavy mass and low coherence scale. The latter is found to be approximately 1-2 Kelvin, even though the most correlated orbital is found to be significantly doped ~10% away from half-filling. A flat quasiparticle band appears near the Fermi level as a result of the strong electronic correlations. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to experiments.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bei Xu, Fan Yang, Ran Qi, Hui Zhai, Peng Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</p>

            <h2>The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudro R. Biswas, Charles S. Wright, Kunaal Joshi, Srividya Iyer-Biswas</p>
            <p>What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</p>

            <p>Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we propose to simulate quantum mechanical supersymmetric model and realize quantum mechanical SUSY in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium coexistence between a fluid and a hotter or colder crystal of granular hard disks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Maire, A. Plati, F. Smallenburg, G. Foffi</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.</p>

            <p>The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eslam Ahmed, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Qi, Karin M. Rabe</p>
            <p>We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We also show that 8 of these 12 structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (oIII), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (oIV), monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) and distorted monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (dm) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.</p>

BKT transitions signaling the onset of Ising and supersolid order are clearly identified, and the Wannier entropy is experimentally recovered just above the supersolid phase. At low temperatures, with an experimental resolution of about 23 $\mu$eV, no discrete coherent magnon modes are resolved within a broad scattering continuum. Alongside gapless excitations, a pseudo-Goldstone mode with a 0.06 meV gap is observed. A second, higher-energy continuum replaces single-spin-flip excitations of the Ising model. Under applied fields, the continuum evolves into coherent spin waves, with Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone sectors responding differently. The experiments and simulations show excellent quantitative agreement.</p>

            <p>Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</p>

            <p>The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model for broad range of strongly correlated phases, particularly the high-Tc superconductor. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize a highly-tunable extended t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. Through engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, the fermionic t-J model with independently tunable exchange and hopping couplings is achieved. With the high tunability, we explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime well beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates, and predict an unprecedented many-body self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement with emergent conserved quantities. The self-pinning effect leads to novel nonthermal quantum many-body dynamics, which violates eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in Krylov subspace. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body physics with t-J model, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in neutral atom systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</p>

            <h2>The origin of anomalous non-linear microwave absorption in Josephson junction qubits: mysterious nature of two level systems or their dynamic interaction?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander L. Burin</p>
            <p>Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are distributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \propto 1/p^{3-\eta}$ ($0\leq \eta <1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.</p>

            <p>Since the advent of quantum mechanics, classical probability interpretations have faced significant challenges. A notable issue arises with the emergence of negative probabilities when attempting to define the joint probability of non-commutative observables. In this work, we propose a resolution to this dilemma for quantum spin chains, by introducing an exact representation of their dynamics in terms of classical continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). These CTMCs effectively model the creation, annihilation, and propagation of pairs of classical particles and antiparticles. The quantum dynamics then emerges by averaging over various realizations of this classical process.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ajit C. Balram, Anirban Sharma, J. K. Jain</p>
            <p>Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.</p>

            <p>The two-state Togashi-Kaneko model demonstrates how, at finite system sizes, autocatalysis can lead to noise-induced bistability between the cellular concentrations of different molecular species. Here, we show that, in the biologically relevant scenario of species-dependent export rates, the nascent stochastic switching between molecular species also drives a concomitant switching between periods of growth or decay in the total population size. We demonstrate this behavior using stochastic simulations as well as the numerical integration of a Fokker-Planck equation that approximates the finite system-size limit. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise approximations, we further find analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is faster than the dynamics in the total population size. We envisage that other models in the voter class -- including spin systems, flocking and opinion dynamics -- may also exhibit aperiodic growth and decay in population size, as well as be amenable to similar techniques.</p>

Addressing all three bottlenecks, we design an algorithm that combines local persistent Event-Chain Monte Carlo moves with global cluster moves, in a O(1)-complexity implementation. Through systematic performance analysis, we show that such an algorithm outperforms traditional Metropolis algorithms by more than a magnitude factor and is competitive with current state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. We then use this approach to determine the dissipative spin chain's phase diagram, thereby reinforcing prior analytical predictions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence and transformation of pinch-point singularities in the excitation spectrum of electronic flat band systems on kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interactions. While pinch points are widely recognized as signatures of classical spin liquids, they also appear in electronic flat-band systems when there exists a singular band-touching point to dispersive bands. We explore how SOC modifies the pinch-point structure in the chiral spin flat-band metallic state, which we term spinor-ice. The pinch point profile can rotate or redistribute its spectral weight, governed by a prefactor in the spectral function that primarily depends on the direction of the ground-state spin polarization, where we show that SOC flat bands could be experimentally probed by rotating the spin polarization of the injected electron to infer internal magnetic structures. These observations are discussed in conjunction with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the application to the potential SOC flat-band material $\rm CsW_2O_6$. We also demonstrate the persistent residual pinch-point features under Coulomb interactions and deviations from the ideal flat-band limit.</p>

We obtain a specific condition that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ must fulfil in order to be able to solve the SDE via mapping the generic process, using a suitable space-time transformation, onto the simpler Wiener process. By taking advantage of this transformation, we obtain the propagator in the case of open, reflecting, and absorbing \emph{time-dependent\/} boundary conditions for a large class of diffusion processes. In particular, this allows us to derive the first-passage time statistics of such a large class of models, some of which were so far unknown. While our results are valid for a wide range of non-autonomous, non-linear and non-homogeneous processes, we illustrate applications in stochastic thermodynamics by focusing on the propagator and first-passage-time statistics of isoentropic processes that were previously realized in the laboratory with Brownian particles trapped with optical tweezers.</p>

            <h2>Subleading-order theory for condensation transitions in large deviations of sums of independent and identically distributed random variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naftali R. Smith</p>
            <p>We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 < x < \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty < x < \infty$. We assume $0 < \alpha < 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 < \alpha < \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c < \alpha < 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.</p>

            <p>Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies and complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. We present a universal scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we discover that Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined geometries in collective modes of two dimensional Dirac fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankan Biswas, Avraham Klein</p>
            <p>It is well known that the time-dependent response of a correlated system can be inferred from its spectral correlation functions. As a textbook example, the zero sound collective modes of a Fermi liquid appear as poles of its particle-hole susceptibilities. However, the Fermi liquid's interactions endow these response functions with a complex analytic structure, so that this time/frequency relationship is no longer straightforward. We study how the geometry of this structure is modified by a nontrivial band geometry, via a calculation of the zero sound spectrum of a Dirac cone in two dimensions. We find that the chiral wavefunctions, that encode the band geometry, fundamentally change the analytic structure of the response functions, which encode its Riemannian geometry. As a result, isotropic interactions can give rise to a variety of unconventional zero sound modes, that, due to the geometry of the functions in frequency space, can only be identified via time-resolved probes. These modes are absent in a conventional Fermi liquid with similar interactions, so that these modes can be used as a sensitive probe for the existence of Dirac points in a band-structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh</p>
            <p>Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. We report a novel flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state. Finally, we present simulations for flocking in an agent-based model consisting of local update rules of colloidal pairs that slide and rotate upon collision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Farajollahpour, R. Ganesh, K. V. Samokhin</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has been detected in several materials using spin-sensitive probes. These measurements require rather complex setups that make it challenging to track variations in altermagnetic order, e.g., to identify a temperature-tuned altermagnetic phase transition. We propose a simple transport measurement that can probe the order parameter for $d$-wave altermagnetism. We suggest magnetoconductivity anisotropy -- the difference between the two principal values of the magnetoconductivity tensor. This quantity can be easily measured as a function of temperature, without any spin-selective apparatus. It acquires a nonzero value in a $C_4K$ phase, where $C_4$ rotations and time reversal $K$ are not symmetries but their combination is. This effect can be traced to the modification of phase space density due to Berry curvature, which we demonstrate using semiclassical equations of motion for band electrons. As an illustration, we build a minimal tight-binding model with altermagnetic order that breaks $C_4$ and $K$ symmetries while preserving $C_4K$.</p>

            <h2>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takafumi Kita</p>
            <p>The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of high temperature superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1=19 meV, Delta2=6-8 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, this allows us to put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Furthermore, a clear bosonic mode with energy Omega=30+-2 meV is observed, which further supports a sign reversal gap. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>We study two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. In the absence of fluctuations, these form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity rotates uniformly in time at a fixed frequency. Fluctuations are described by the (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order. For weak chirality, the system is in the linear regime of the KPZ equation for a wide range of length scales, over which it exhibits quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for velocity and density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HE effects, we synthesized 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, {\delta}-ZrH1.6, {\epsilon}-ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH) , using bulk metal foils as precursors and sulfuric/oleic acid as hydrogen donors. Through high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, the physical critical pressure ({\Delta}Pph) and equivalent pressure ({\Delta}Peq) concept were introduced to elucidate the mechanisms of the synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides. Quantitative analysis of 18 metal hydrides establishes that the criterion |{\Delta}Peq| > {\Delta}Pph governs HE-driven hydride synthesis. Conversely, when |{\Delta}Peq| < {\Delta}Pph , hydrogen-induced brittle fracture initiates. This mechanism enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides (LiH) while concurrently explaining failure modes in metals such as Fe. Our approach successfully converts HE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SangEun Han, Igor F. Herbut</p>
            <p>We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. this http URL. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</p>

            <p>Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</p>

            <p>We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.</p>

            <p>The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</p>

            <p>In this work, we identify the local structural defects that control the non-affine displacement fields in jammed disk packings subjected to athermal, quasistatic (AQS) simple shear. While complex non-affine displacement fields typically occur during simple shear, isolated effective quadrupoles are also observed and their probability increases with increasing pressure. We show that the emergence of an isolated effective quadrupole requires the breaking of an interparticle contact that is aligned with low-frequency, spatially extended vibrational modes. Since the Eshelby inhomogeneity problem gives rise to quadrupolar displacement fields in continuum materials, we reformulate and implement Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method (EIM) for jammed disk packings. Using EIM, we show that we can reconstruct the non-affine displacement fields for jammed disk packings in response to applied shear as a sum of discrete Eshelby-like defects that are caused by mismatches in the local stiffnesses of triangles formed from Delaunay triangulation of the disk centers.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking considerations play an important role in allowing reliable and accurate predictions of complex systems in quantum many-body simulations. The general theory of perturbations in symmetry-breaking phases is nonetheless intrinsically more involved than in the unbroken phase due to non-vanishing anomalous Green's functions or anomalous quasiparticle interactions. In the present paper, we develop a formulation of many-body theory at non-zero temperature which is explicitly covariant with respect to a group containing Bogoliubov transformations. Based on the concept of Nambu tensors, we derive a factorisation of standard Feynman diagrams that is valid for a general Hamiltonian. The resulting factorised amplitudes are indexed over the set of un-oriented Feynman diagrams with fully antisymmetric vertices. We argue that, within this framework, the design of symmetry-breaking many-body approximations is simplified.</p>

            <p>The theory of Self-Consistent Green's Function (SCGF) is reformulated in an explicit Nambu-covariant fashion for applications to many-body systems at non-zero temperature in symmetry-broken phases. This is achieved by extending the Nambu-covariant formulation of perturbation theory, presented in the first part of this work, to non-perturbative schemes based on self-consistently dressed propagators and vertices. We work out in detail the self-consistent ladder approximation, motivated by a trade-off between numerical complexity and many-body phenomenology. Taking a complex general Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) propagator as a starting point, we also formulate and prove a sufficient condition on the stability of the HFB self-energy to ensure the convergence of the initial series of ladders at any energy. The self-consistent ladder approximation is written purely in terms of spectral functions and the resulting set of equations, when expressed in terms of Nambu tensors, are remarkably similar to those in the symmetry-conserving case. This puts the application of the self-consistent ladder approximation to symmetry-broken phases of infinite nuclear matter within reach.</p>

Meanwhile, the lower bound adapts the cavity method of Chen so that it can be combined with the synchronization technique of Panchenko; this part requires no convexity assumption. In order to guarantee that the resulting Parisi formula has a minimizer, we formalize the pairing of synchronization maps with overlap measures so that the constraint set is a compact metric space.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik Bates, Youngtak Sohn</p>
            <p>There is a rich history of expressing the limiting free energy of mean-field spin glasses as a variational formula over probability measures on $[0,1]$, where the measure represents the similarity (or "overlap") of two independently sampled spin configurations. At high temperatures, the formula's minimum is achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem. Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses. Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational formula, here we present this formula's Crisanti-Sommers representation. In the process, we gain new access to a problem unique to the multi-species setting. Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB for one implies RSB for the other. Moreover, the level of symmetry breaking must be identical, even in cases of full RSB. In the presence of an external field, any type of interaction suffices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Franchini, Riccardo Balzan</p>
            <p>An influential theory of increasing returns has been proposed by the economist W. B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between two competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are two competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism: each new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd number of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this sample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost surely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization [G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where the new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability, and buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be reduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of physical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the Friedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation analysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows to find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable. Interestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we observe a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We also find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating function of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable perturbations theory.</p>

            <p>Integrating magnetic skyrmions into neuromorphic computing could help improve hardware efficiency and computational power. However, developing a scalable implementation of the weighted sum of neuron signals - a core operation in neural networks - has remained a challenge. Here, we show that weighted sum operations can be performed in a compact, biologically-inspired manner by using the non-volatile and particle-like characteristics of magnetic skyrmions that make them easily countable and summable. The skyrmions are electrically generated in numbers proportional to an input with an efficiency given by a non-volatile weight. The chiral particles are then directed using localized current injections to a location where their presence is quantified through non-perturbative electrical measurements. Our experimental demonstration, which currently has two inputs, can be scaled to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs using a crossbar array design, potentially nearing the energy efficiency observed in biological systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Manshouri, Moslem Zarei, Mehdi Abdi, Sougato Bose, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</p>

            <h2>The Structure of the Majorana Clifford Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valérie Bettaque, Brian Swingle</p>
            <p>In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study their analogues for systems composed of Majorana fermions. In this case, a crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system with fundamentally fermionic degrees of freedom. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving Majorana Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\F$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group when acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on the same sector.</p>

            <h2>Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard A. Davison, Luca V. Delacretaz</p>
            <p>We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</p>

            <h2>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <p>Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis. Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nanako Shitara, Andrés Montoya-Castillo</p>
            <p>Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing robust quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors operating at molecular scales. However, current noise spectroscopies rely on severe approximations that sacrifice accuracy and precision. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. It self-consistently extracts noise spectra that characterize the interactions between a quantum sensor and its environment from commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is resilient to measurement errors. We quantify confidence intervals and sensitivity measures to identify experiments that improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that previous measurements had overestimated the strength of low-frequency noise by an order of magnitude. Our method uncovers previously hidden structure with unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tista Banerjee, Suchetan Das, K. Sengupta</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</p>

            <p>We present an optical tweezer array of $^{87}$Rb atoms housed in an cryogenic environment that successfully combines a 4 K cryopumping surface, a <50 K cold box surrounding the atoms, and a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens. We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.</p>

            <p>Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schrödinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</p>

            <p>Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Balasubramanian, Charlie Cummings</p>
            <p>We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact simple gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state (GHZ)-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.</p>

            <p>We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</p>

            <p>The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

            <p>In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</p>

Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</p>

            <p>Controlling bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in fluid systems is crucial for the safety and efficacy of medical and industrial processes. Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.</p>

            <p>The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-André models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-André models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</p>

            <p>The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean field problems such as the Schrödinger-Poisson equation is notoriously capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH) equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.</p>

            <p>Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <p>{\alpha}-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride ({\alpha}-RuCl3) has attracted significant attention because of its potential for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid. In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.</p>

            <h2>Effective anisotropic interaction potentials for pairs of ultracold molecules shielded by a static electric field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijit Mukherjee, Luis Santos, Jeremy M. Hutson</p>
            <p>Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Determining the complex second-order optical susceptibility in macroscale van der Waals heterobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyuan Zhu, Taejun Yoo, Kanchan Shaikh, Amalya C. Johnson, Qiuyang Li, Fang Liu, Hui Deng, Yuki Kobayashi</p>
            <p>We report on the experimental characterization of the second-order susceptibility in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayers, including their hidden complex phases. To this end, we developed a heterodyne-detection scheme for second-harmonic generation and applied it to macroscale heterobilayer samples prepared using the gold-tape exfoliation method. The heterodyne scheme enabled us to distinguish the relative orientation of the crystal domains, and further, it allowed us to characterize the complex phases of the susceptibility relative to a reference quartz sample. By comparing the results from the monolayer regions and the heterobilayer region over several hundred microns of the sample area, we determined that the contribution of interlayer effects to second-harmonic generation is within the experimental uncertainty arising from the sample inhomogeneity. The results here provide fundamental quantitative information necessary for the precise design of nanophotonic systems based on stacking engineering.</p>

            <p>Recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity on multilayer nickelates under high pressure have stimulated great interest. The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of topological Kondo insulating state in MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongdong Han, Yiyu Xia, Zhengchao Xia, Wenjin Zhao, Yichi Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak</p>
            <p>Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in moiré materials.</p>

            <p>When thinned down to just a few atomic layers, the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 offers an exceptional platform for exploring a wide range of topological phenomena. In this work, we overcome longstanding challenges in synthesizing high-purity MnBi2Te4 crystals and report the observation of a myriad of quantized topological states in high-quality five-septuple-layer (5-SL) samples under magnetic fields up to 45 Tesla. We show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport. Our results establish high-quality MnBi2Te4 as a robust platform for exploring emergent topological states and for advancing novel quantum device applications.</p>

            <h2>Polariton transport in 2D semiconductors: Phonon-mediated transitions between ballistic, superdiffusive and exciton-limited regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Roberto Rosati, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.</p>

            <p>Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.</p>

            <h2>Prediction of High-Temperature Half Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semi-magnetic Topological Insulator of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. U. Muzaffar, Kai-Zhi Bai, Wei Qin, Guohua Cao, Yutong Yang, Shunhong Zhang, Ping Cui, Shun-Qing Shen, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K, driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aastha Jain, Dheeraj Kumar Singh</p>
            <p>We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet within the random-phase approximation. We find that the non-reciprocal behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned in-plane and not out-of-plane. Furthermore, the spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior in a direction in the momentum space reciprocal to an in-plane direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic moments. In that case, the first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>Transient size segregation of a bi-disperse granular mixture flowing over a periodic chute is studied using the Discrete Element Method and continuum simulations. A recently developed particle force-based size segregation model is used to predict the time-dependent flow properties of binary mixtures starting from rest. A two-way coupled continuum model that solves the momentum balance and convection-diffusion equations by incorporating the mixture segregation model along with the generalized inertial number-based rheological model is developed for predicting the evolution of segregation. The predicted concentration profiles and other flow properties of the mixture are found to be in good agreement with the DEM data for a variety of compositions. The evolution of the centre of mass of the two species with time is also very well captured for different initial configurations and size ratios using the particle force-based segregation model.</p>

            <p>Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.</p>

            <p>Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</p>

            <p>The selection of an appropriate solvent has long been a critical factor in the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) nanosheets. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) remains one of the most commonly used solvents due to its favourable surface tension compatibility, particularly with tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which facilitates a relatively high yield of exfoliated nanosheets. However, prolonged exposure of the nanosheets to NMP promotes oxidation, consequently diminishing their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly solvent system, consisting of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionised water (DI), induces significantly less oxidation and results in enhanced HER performance. Notably, this green solvent system achieves the lowest overpotential of 0.209 V vs RHE after 24 hours of chronoamperometry.</p>

            <p>Simple binary oxide glasses can exhibit a compression behavior distinct from that of their crystalline counterparts. In this study, we employed high-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell to investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$ up to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Weberszpil</p>
            <p>Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</p>

Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</p>

            <h2>Effective behavior of heterogeneous media governed by strain gradient elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harkirat Singh, Mayank Raj, Kaushik Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Various mechanical phenomena depend on the length scale, and these have inspired a variety of nonlocal and higher gradient continuum theories. Mechanistically, it is believed that the length scale dependence arises due to an interplay between the length scale of heterogeneities in the material, the length scale of the material being probed and the phenomenon under study. In this paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by studying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by strain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find that the overall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other words, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this scale. We also find that the overall behavior may be described by a kernel-based nonlocal elasticity theory, and approximated locally by a fractional strain gradient elasticity. Consequently, one can obtain various scaling laws with exponent between zero (classical elasticity) and one (strain-gradient elasticity). We also learn the overall behavior using a Fourier neural operator.</p>

            <h2>Phenomenological model of decaying Bose polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ragheed Alhyder, Georg M. Bruun, Thomas Pohl, Mikhail Lemeshko, Artem G. Volosniev</p>
            <p>Cold atom experiments show that a mobile impurity particle immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate forms a well-defined quasiparticle (Bose polaron) for weak to moderate impurity-boson interaction strengths, whereas a significant line broadening is consistently observed for strong interactions. Motivated by this, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the most relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most one boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to which the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant states can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations involving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave function combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first motivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes correlations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to recover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral and the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an intuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the importance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay in a many-body setting.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen a vast increase in research onto van der Waals magnetic materials, due to the richness of many-body effects and the versatility for next-generation technologies. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-wave orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. To solve this issue, here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary absorption and photoemission spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and demonstrating that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism in this material is attributable to the orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights that can be readily generalized to many other low-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Modeling of a twisted-Kagome HoAgGe spin ice using Reduced-Configuration-Space Search and Density Functional Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gunnar F. Schwertfeger, Po-Hao Chang, Predrag Nikolic, Igor I. Mazin</p>
            <p>The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also parametrically frustrated.</p>

            <h2>Electrons in quantum dots on helium: from charge qubits to synthetic color centers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. I. Dykman, J. Pollanen</p>
            <p>Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</p>

The stability of Pt-Porphyrin functionalized SLG at room temperature granted the execution of voltage-dependent Spin Torque Ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJV-1m-1) was determined at the interface, and the Spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) was improved by an order of one in functionalized graphene to compare with pristine SLG</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Hall, Thomas Schaefer</p>
            <p>We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.</p>

            <h2>Unusual electronic structure in underdoped cuprate superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Li, Minghuan Zeng, Huaiming Guo, Shiping Feng</p>
            <p>The underdoped cuprate superconductors are characterized by the opening of the pseudogap, while such an aspect of the pseudogap effect should be reflected in the low-energy electronic structure (LEES). Here the effect of the pseudogap on LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated within the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. The strong coupling of the electrons with the spin excitation induces the pseudogap-state in the particle-hole channel and superconducting (SC) state in the particle-particle channel, where the pseudogap and SC gap respectively originate from the electron normal and anomalous self-energies, and are evaluated by taking into account the vertex correction. As a natural consequence of the interplay between the pseudogap-state and SC-state, the SC transition temperature Tc exhibits a dome-like shape of the doping dependence, however, in a striking contrast to Tc in the underdoped regime, the pseudogap crossover temperature T* is much higher than Tc in the underdoped regime, and then it decreases with the increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with Tc at the end of the SC dome. Concomitantly, the spectral weight on the electron Fermi surface (EFS) at around the antinodal region is suppressed strongly by this pseudogap, and then EFS is truncated to form four disconnected Fermi arcs centered around the nodal region with the largest spectral weight located at around the tips of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Moreover, the dip in the peak-dip-hump structure observed in the energy distribution curve and checkerboard charge ordering found in the ARPES autocorrelation are intrinsically connected with the emergence of the pseudogap. The theory therefore indicates that the same spin excitation that governs both the pseudogap-state and SC-state naturally leads to the exotic features of LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric Enhancement and Hierarchical Scaling in One-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jundi Wang, Yuxiao Chen, Huaqing Huang</p>
            <p>The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in periodic crystals and moiré materials. Here, we systematically investigate quantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover novel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic crystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that quasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the absence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical wavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the Aubry-André-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a sensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the critical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci chain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an anomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within the minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative renormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical structure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states across narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between wavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting quasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum geometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of quantum oscillators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michel Caffarel</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.</p>

            <h2>Growth and prediction of plastic strain in metallic glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tero Mäkinen, Anshul D. S. Parmar, Silvia Bonfanti, Mikko Alava</p>
            <p>Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding challenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional reliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly or gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends strongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding generalizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power, they often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability, methodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a macroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation in the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method reduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical alternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses prepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic strain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed samples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth parameters from stress-strain data within $\sim$5\% strain, enabling early prediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The predictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates with the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding. This work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant framework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early mechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for material characterization and design.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.</p>

            <p>Twisted van der Waals materials provide a tunable platform for investigating two-dimensional superconductivity and quantum phases. Using spectra-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene and track their evolution from insulating phases. Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states. This gate-dependent transition from an insulating phase to a modulated superconductor uncovers an unexpected spatial hierarchy in pairing behavior and offers direct microscopic insights to constrain theories of superconductivity in moiré systems.</p>

Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux.

Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.</p>

            <p>Entanglement underpins quantum information processing and computing, yet its experimental quantification in complex, many-body condensed matter systems remains a considerable challenge. Here, we reveal a highly entangled electronic phase proximate to a quantum metal-insulator transition, identified by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering interferometry. This approach reveals that entanglement across atomic sites generates characteristic interference patterns, which our model accurately reproduces, enabling extraction of a full entanglement spectrum and resolution of the underlying quantum states. Our analysis of the pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 demonstrates that the system undergoes pronounced quantum fluctuations in its spin, orbital and charge degrees of freedom, even in the presence of a long-range 'all-in-all-out' antiferromagnetic order. Importantly, the observed entanglement signatures facilitate the coexistence of multiple exotic symmetry-breaking orders. Complementary investigations using Raman spectroscopy corroborate the presence of these hidden orders and their emergent excitations. In particular, we observe a two-magnon-bound state below the lowest single-magnon excitation energy, which, together with split phonon modes, provides strong evidence for cubic symmetry-breaking orders of magnetic origin juxtaposed with the all-in-all-out order. Our work thus establishes a direct link between quantum entanglement and emergent unconventional orders, opening new avenues for investigating quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>We revisit Landau's theory by renormalizing quadratic coefficients from nonlinear polynomial equations to adapt them to the system's dimensionality. These coefficients are employed to perform detailed specific-heat calculations for several high-temperature superconductors near the superconducting transition. We phenomenologically explain the change in the specific heat jump using Ginzburg-Landau theory, which is applicable to any spatial arrangement and interactions between electrons that influence the system's symmetries. We discuss the effects that may lead to the rapid and non-monotonic variation of the specific heat jump, $\Delta{C_p}/T_{c}$, across the transition over relatively small ranges of fluctuations, focusing particularly on changes attributed to the Sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state. We quantitatively explain the considerable reduction, disappearance, or significant enhancement of the specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition, considering strong fluctuation corrections to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of low-dimensional systems. Additionally, we study the evolution of specific heat jumps by varying the system's dimensionality and discuss the results in relation to experimental observations of specific-heat jumps in iron-, yttrium-, and bismuth-based superconductors, as well as in $\beta$-pyrochlore oxides superconductors like $KOs_2O_6$.</p>

The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features.

Second, unlike moiré systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.</p>

A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications.

            <p>The rheology of dense granular shear flows is influenced by friction and particle shape. We investigate numerically the impact of non-spherical particle geometries under shear on packing fraction, stress ratios, velocity fluctuations, force distribution, and dissipation mechanisms, for a wide range of inertial numbers, friction coefficients and aspect ratios. We obtain a regime diagram for the dissipation which shows that lentil-like (oblate) particles exhibit an extended sliding regime compared to rice-like (prolate) particles with the same degree of eccentricity. Additionally, we identify non-monotonic behaviour of slightly aspherical particles at low friction, linking it to their higher fluctuating rotational kinetic energy. We find that angular velocity fluctuations are generally reduced when particles align with the flow, except in highly frictional rolling regimes, where fluctuations collapse onto a power-law distribution and motion becomes less correlated. Moreover, for realistic friction coefficients power dissipation tends to concentrate along the major axis aligned with the flow, where slip events are more frequent. We also show that flat particles develop stronger fabric anisotropy than elongated ones, influencing macroscopic stress transmission. These findings provide new insights into the role of particle shape in granular mechanics, with implications for both industrial and geophysical applications.</p>

            <p>Low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) topological materials such as MoTe$_2$ host efficient charge-to-spin conversion (CSC) mechanisms that can be harnessed for novel electronic and spintronic devices. However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.</p>

            <h2>Coexistent multifractal mesoscopic fluctuations in Integer Quantum Hall Transition and in Orbital Hall Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan L. Pessoa, Antônio M. S. Macêdo, Anderson L. R. Barbosa</p>
            <p>We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel insights to future IQHT analysis.</p>

            <h2>The role of dimensionality in the magnetic properties of CeIn$_3$ nanowires</h2>

            <p>In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongling Liu, Zheng-Yang Zhuan, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</p>

            <h2>Efficient transport of indirect excitons in a van der Waals heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiwen Zhou, W. J. Brunner, E. A. Szwed, H. Henstridge, L. H. Fowler-Gerace, L. V. Butov</p>
            <p>Exciton transport is fundamental for understanding transport phenomena in bosonic systems and for embracing excitation energy transfer in materials. Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in separated layers. Long IX lifetimes allow them to form quantum bosonic states and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved photoluminescence imaging. These measurements probe the kinetics of IX cloud expansion and reveal the transport characteristics. We found IX transport with anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. This efficient IX transport agrees with long-range ballistic transport and is consistent with the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction of superfluid in moire superlattices.</p>

            <h2>Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie Love, István A. Kovács</p>
            <p>Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Deciphering the interplay between wetting and chemo-mechanical fracture in lithium-ion battery cathode materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wan-Xin Chen, Luis J. Carrillo, Arnab Maji, Xiang-Long Peng, Joseph Handy, Sarbajit Banerjee, Bai-Xiang Xu</p>
            <p>Crack growth in lithium-ion battery electrodes is typically detrimental and undesirable. However, recent experiments suggest that stabilized fracture of cathode active materials in liquid electrolytes can increase electrochemically active surfaces, shorten diffusion pathway, enhance (de)lithiation and improve overall capacity. To decipher the fundamental couplings between electrolyte wetting and fracture evolution and evaluate their influences on macroscopic battery performance, we conducted an integrated experiment-simulation study on $\alpha$-V2O5 single crystals and polycrystalline NCM as model cathode materials. Despite synthesis challenges, single-crystal $\alpha$-V2O5 offers clearer fundamental insights than polycrystalline counterparts with grain-boundary complexities. Fracture patterns and lithiation heterogeneities on the samples were mapped using advanced scanning techniques after chemical (de)lithiation cycles, exhibiting excellent agreements with simulations by the developed multiphysics model. Results reveal a mutually reinforcing interplay between wetting and fracture: (i) electrolyte infiltration at fracture surfaces enhances (de)lithiation and compositional heterogeneity; (ii) wetting influences fracture dynamics, including fracture modes, propagation distance and directionality. The validated modelling framework is further applied to simulations on polycrystalline NCM particles under constant-current (dis)charging, highlighting the critical role of wetting in promoting fracture and improving overall capacity. This work bridges fundamental understanding of wetting-fracture coupling with practical implications for battery performance optimization via controlled fracture engineering.</p>

            <h2>Nitrogen-related short-range order in Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels: first principles and cluster expansion study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Su, Brian J. Blankenau, Namhoon Kim, Jessica A. Krogstad, Elif Ertekin</p>
            <p>Nitrogen (N) is a key alloying element that enhances the performance of Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels, improving austenite stability, corrosion resistance, and yield strength. However, the role of N in modifying chemical ordering, particularly short-range order (SRO) and long-range order (LRO), is complex due to the multi-sublattice nature and magnetic interactions in these alloys. In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with the spin cluster expansion (spin CE) method to systematically investigate the effects of N on chemical ordering in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Our atomistic models confirm a strong affinity between N and Cr, which drives the formation of N-Cr SRO and, at higher N concentrations, stabilizes M4N-type ordered phases (M = metal). Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low N concentrations promote local N-Cr or N-N SRO, while increasing N content leads to the emergence of Cr-and N-rich LRO structures. We also show that the presence of N suppresses intrinsic Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr SRO by competing with these interactions, particularly at high concentrations. The impact of Cr content on ordering diminishes as N approaches its solubility limit. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in high-N austenitic steels. Finally, we discuss the influence of kinetic and magnetic effects on SRO evolution in high-N alloys. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding N-driven chemical ordering and offers insights into microstructural changes during nitriding processes.</p>
