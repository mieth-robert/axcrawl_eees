            <h2>Electronic structure of SLSiN under charge density modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashkan Shekaari</p>
            <p>First-principles density-functional theory calculations were carried out to assess how incremental unit-cell charging alters the electronic behavior of SLSiN (single-layer Si$_3$N$_4$). The net charge per cell was systematically tuned from $n\,=\,0$ (the neutral/reference configuration) to $n\,=\,\pm\,1,\pm\,2$, and $\pm\,3$ elementary charges, and for each charged configuration the band structure and density of states were evaluated at the PBE level. In its neutral state, SLSiN exhibits zero electronegativity, signifying both its indifference to additional electron density and its intrinsic stability when integrated into heterostructures. Altogether, these results reveal that precise control of the charge density can drive SLSiN across an insulator-to-metal transition.</p>

            <h2>Andreev molecules at distance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erik S. Samuelsen, Yuli V. Nazarov</p>
            <p>Andreev molecule states arise from hybridization of Andreev bound states in different Josephson Junctions. Extensive theoretical and experimental research concentrates on direct coherent electron coupling between the junctions: this implies the distance between the junctions is of the order of superconducting coherence length, that is, short. We propose and discuss the possibility to create Andreev molecules at long (in principle, arbitrary long) distance between the junctions. In this case, the hybridized states are excited quasi-particle singlets and the coupling is provided by an embedding electric circuit. To achieve a strong hybridization, one aligns the energies of the Andreev bound states with associated phase differences. In fact, a recent experiment realizes such setup. With circuit theory we derive the hybridization level splitting and estimate the scale of the effect. Since the phenomenon encompasses excited states, we derive and solve the associated Lindblad equation under condition of persistent resonant excitation. By analyzing the resulting dissipative dynamics we identify relevant regimes where the hybridization and resonant excitation peaks are most pronounced. The low-frequency mutual inductance of the Josephson junctions is an important signature of the molecular state and associated non-local Josephson effect. We demonstrate the peak structures for both mutual and self-inductance, and compute them in various frequency regimes. In an interesting common case the embedding circuit includes an oscillator, which can be used both to enhance hybridization and for state readout with two-tone spectroscopy. We derive and solve Lindblad equations for the conditions of two-tone spectroscopy to demonstrate the the readout of molecular states.</p>

            <h2>Trimer superfluidity of antiparallel dipolar excitons in a bilayer heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pradyumna P. Belgaonkar, Michal Zimmerman, Snir Gazit, Dror Orgad</p>
            <p>We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Mass-gap description of heavy impurities in Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Eugen Dizer, Emilio Ramos Rodr√≠guez, Richard Schmidt</p>
            <p>We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</p>

            <h2>Hamiltonian parameter inference from RIXS spectra with active learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marton K. Lajer, Xin Dai, Kipton Barros, Matthew R. Carbone, S. Johnston, M. P. M. Dean</p>
            <p>Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3, NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3, that were previously missing from the literature.</p>

            <h2>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen</p>
            <p>The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum oscillation and topology change of the uncondensed Landau Fermi surface in superconducting CeCoIn5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sangyun Lee, Duk. Y. Kim, Andrew J. Woods, Priscila F. S. Rosa, E. D. Bauer, Filip Ronning, Shi-Zeng Lin, R. Movshovich</p>
            <p>Metals typically have multiple Fermi surface sheets, and when they enter the superconducting state, some electrons on these sheets may remain uncondensed, or their superconducting pairs can be rapidly destroyed by a magnetic field. Detecting uncondensed electrons within the superconducting state provides key information about the underlying electronic structure; however, this task remains a significant experimental challenge. Here we demonstrate quantum oscillations from the uncondensed electrons in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5, observed through thermal conductivity measurements with a magnetic field rotating within the tetragonal a-b plane. We detect a fine structure in thermal conductivity, characterized by multiple small resonances (oscillations) in a rotating magnetic field. Remarkably, the phase of these resonances shifted by as much as {\pi} for a field above 9.7 T where spin-density wave (SDW) order emerges and coexists with superconductivity. This phase shift is naturally explained by a change in the Berry phase of the uncondensed Fermi surface, driven by the Fermi surface reconstruction associated with the onset of SDW order. Our work unambiguously shows the existence of uncondensed electrons in the superconducting state of CeCoIn5, thus resolving a longstanding debate on this issue.</p>

            <h2>Spatial filtering of interlayer exciton ground state in WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Disheng Chen, Kevin Dini, Abdullah Rasmita, Zumeng Huang, Qinghai Tan, Hongbing Cai, Ruihua He, Yansong Miao, Timothy C. H. Liew, Wei-bo Gao</p>
            <p>Long-life interlayer excitons (IXs) in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructure are promising for realizing excitonic condensates at high temperatures. Critical to this objective is to separate the IX ground state (the lowest energy of IX state) emission from other states emissions. Filtering the IX ground state is also essential in uncovering the dynamics of correlated excitonic states, such as the excitonic Mott insulator. Here, we show that the IX ground state in WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer can be separated from other states by its spatial profile. The emissions from different moire IX modes are identified by their different energies and spatial distributions, which fits well with the rate-diffusion model for cascading emission. Our results show spatial filtering of the ground state mode and enrich the toolbox to realize correlated states at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>The Solid-state Physics of Rydberg-dressed Bosonic Mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ming Duan, Liang-Jun He, Fabian Maucher, Yong-Chang Zhang</p>
            <p>We explore phases of two-component Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates in three spatial dimensions. The competition between the effective ranges of inter- and intra-component soft-core interactions leads to a rich variety of ground states. These include states resembling ionic compounds with face-centered cubic or simple cubic lattice structure. Upon increasing the scattering length, the dimensionality of the symmetry-breaking is lower due to the suppression of large densities, leading to segregated planar or tubular density profiles. We also show that these states are not only stable ground states, but can also emerge dynamically upon time evolution.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional charge density wave in Kagome metal BaFe2Al9</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liucheng Chen, Mingwei Ma, Xiaohui Yu, Fang Hong</p>
            <p>The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally, CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems. Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Exciton photoemission from a ground state of a solid Ta2Pd3Te5</h2>

            <p>Excitons are bosonic quasiparticles with a variety of applications in optoelectronics, photosyn thesis, and dissipationless informatics, and their lifetime can become sufficiently long to form a quantum condensate. While exciton condensation has been predicted to occur as a ground state of a solid, so called an excitonic insulator, whose material realization has been elusive. Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta2Pd3Te5 below its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase transition. This measurement further discloses the size and the unusual odd parity of the exciton wave function. The present finding opens an avenue toward applications of coherent excitons in solid systems and searching for exotic quantum phases of exciton condensates.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Christianen, Atac Imamoglu</p>
            <p>Exciton spectroscopy serves as a sensitive probe of electronic states in two-dimensional semiconductors. A prominent feature in optical spectra is the trion peak arising from the binding of a charge carrier to an exciton. The splitting between the exciton and trion peaks is usually interpreted as the trion binding energy, but we theoretically show that this view is incomplete. Since dark excitons are more strongly bound than the bright exciton, the trion wave function is asymmetric and a large contribution to the measured splitting is the difference between the bright and dark exciton binding energies. Our model quantitatively explains the measured trion energies in MoSe2 and WSe2, demonstrating the importance of the internal structure of the exciton for the interpretation of the optical response of transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Physics from Spin-Phonon Coupling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zhang, Langxuan Chen, Pengfei Zhang</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$ symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit, as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.</p>

            <h2>Atomic-scale Frustrated Josephson Coupling and Multi-condensate Visualization in FeSe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nileema Sharma, Matthew Toole, James McKenzie, Sheng Ran, Xiaolong Liu</p>
            <p>In a Josephson junction involving multi-band superconductors, competition between inter-band and inter-junction Josephson coupling gives rise to frustration and spatial disjunction of superfluid densities among superconducting condensates. Such frustrated coupling manifests as quantum interference of Josephson currents from different tunneling channels and becomes tunable if channel transparency can be varied. To explore these unconventional effects in the prototypical $s^\pm$-wave superconductor FeSe, we use atomic resolution scanned Josephson tunneling microscopy SJTM for condensate resolved imaging and junction tuning -- capabilities unattainable in macroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively demonstrate frustrated Josephson tunneling by examining two tunneling inequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunneling pathways is found tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0-pi transition with decreasing SJTM junction resistance. Simultaneous visualization of both superconducting condensates reveals anti correlated superfluid modulations, highlighting the role of inter-band scattering. Our study establishes SJTM as a powerful tool enabling new research frontiers of multi condensate superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Floquet topological phases in the SSH lattice</h2>

            <p>Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases, although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably, fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Abelian-Higgs vortices in the oscillating axion background</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoya Kitajima, Shota Nakagawa</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of Abelian-Higgs vortices in the background of a coherently oscillating axion field. We show that the electric field is induced in the magnetic core of the vortex due to the axion-photon conversion. Moreover, because the electromagnetic field is confined in the vortex and excluded from the superconducting bulk regions due to the Meissner effect, the vortex tube can be regarded as a cylindrical cavity, and our numerical analysis shows that the resonant cavity mode (TM010 mode) can be efficiently enhanced in this tube. We also focus on the interaction of two vortices in the oscillating axion background, resulting in attractive or repulsive forces, even in the case with the BPS limit. These new features open up a new possibility for the axion dark matter search using superconducting devices.</p>

            <h2>N√©el Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin and Anomalous Hall Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyu Tang, Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N√©el-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Matteo Magoni, Hannes Pichler</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS with nontrivial spatial connectivity. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</p>

            <p>Topological electronic states such as topological insulators and quantum Hall states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field for electron systems.</p>

We observed the ODMR signal from an ensemble of NV centers under high pressures, reaching up to 20 GPa, with a culet diameter of 600 $\mu$m. We also performed ODMR measurements on multiple microdiamonds sealed inside a sample chamber and found that the resonance frequency varied with the pressure distribution. The combination of NPD and microdiamonds containing NV centers is auspicious for pressure and magnetic imaging under concurrent high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.</p>

            <h2>Topological Majorana flat bands in the Kitaev model on a Bishamon-kikko lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiyu Fukui, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>We unveil an interesting example of topological flat bands of Majorana fermions in quantum spin liquids. We study the Kitaev model on a periodically depleted honeycomb lattice, under a magnetic field within the perturbation theory. The model can be straightforwardly extended while maintaining the exact solvability, and its ground state is a quantum spin liquid as on the honeycomb lattice. As fractionalized excitations, there are unpaired localized Majorana fermions in addition to the itinerant Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes. We show that in the absence of the magnetic field the Majorana fermions have completely flat bands at zero energy, and by applying the magnetic field, they turn into topological flat bands with nonzero Chern number. By varying the anisotropy of the interactions and the magnitude of the magnetic field, we clarify that the system exhibits a variety of topological phases that do not appear in the original model. We emphasize that the topological flat bands that give this rich topology come from the hybridization of the Majorana flat bands and unpaired Majorana fermions, which is unique to the flat bands of fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids. Our findings would stimulate the exploration of a new type of Kitaev materials exhibiting rich topology from topological Majorana flat bands.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Electric Control of Individual Molecules on Surfaces</h2>

            <p>Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC) for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway towards electrically controlled quantum operation.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Coherence with a Clock Transition and Dynamical Decoupling in the Cr$_7$Mn Molecular Nanomagnet</h2>

            <p>Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn, a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields $T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of molecular-based spin qubits.</p>

            <p>In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim) gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit gate set for spin-based quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Sizable superconducting gap and anisotropic chiral topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</h2>

            <p>Topological superconductors offer a fertile ground for realizing Majorana zero modes -- topologically protected, zero-energy quasiparticles that are resilient to local perturbations and hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for intrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the McMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed superconducting (SC) gap $\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter $\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable surface SC gaps ($\Delta > 10\,\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting remarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic level, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building on this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we uncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that ubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical simulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an anisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that the observed ABSs are of topological origin. The combination of a large, nontrivial pairing gap and accessible surface states establishes PtBi$_2$ as a compelling platform for investigating topological superconductivity and its associated Majorana modes.</p>

            <p>We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.</p>

            <p>J-aggregates are promising organic materials for nanophotonic applications due to their excitonic properties and ability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature, providing a robust platform for nanoscale light manipulation. While thin films composed of J-aggregates have demonstrated these advantages, colloidal J-aggregate nanoparticles remain underexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of colloidal J-aggregate flakes by electrostatic interaction of cyanine molecules (TDBC) and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). These flakes exhibit colloidal stability maintaining the J-aggregate conformation even in solvents that favoured their monomeric state. The characterization of the colloidal J-aggregate flakes reveals their capability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature. This was further confirmed at single-particle level by observing an angular-independent Reststrahlen band near the excitonic resonance. In addition, the colloidal flakes exhibit a strong scattering component that broadens the extinction band and redshifts the photoluminescence, indicating that the colloidal architecture influences the optical response. These findings introduce a versatile colloidal system for constructing excitonic nanostructures tailored for advanced photonic applications.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a dynamical regime emerges, characterized by a dual response in the inelastic spectrum composed of short-live dispersive excitations and a quasi-elastic component. Strongly frustrated exchange interactions combined with subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects are a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of this spin-liquid behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian B√∂nsel, Flore K. Kunst, Federico Roccati</p>
            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</p>

            <p>We report on the optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on the 1S exciton-polariton resonance in bulk ZnSe that is subject to an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the light wave vector $\mathbf k$ (Voigt geometry). For the symmetry allowed geometry with the $\mathbf{k}\parallel[111]$ crystal axes, the nonreciprocal dependence of the SHG intensity on the magnetic field direction is found. It is explained by an interference of the crystallographic and magnetic-field-induced SHG signals. Relative phases of these signals are evaluated from the rotational anisotropy diagrams. Phenomenological and microscopic models of the effect are developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of the nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductor crystals, and the first one for exciton-polaritons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. A. Saltykova, A. V. Yulin, I. A. Shelykh</p>
            <p>Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major role.</p>

            <p>The generation of indistinguishable single photons is a fundamental requirement for future quantum technologies, particularly in quantum repeater networks and for distributed quantum computing based on entanglement distribution. However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in epitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their practical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach to mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into an electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission enhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge environment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon extraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton dephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in visibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at the optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to 1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a quasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time (T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 = 2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions from rate equation modeling and quantum optical analysis as well as voltage-dependent linewidth measurements, demonstrating optimized electrical control of exciton dephasing.</p>

            <p>Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N√©el vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.</p>

The scheme can avoid the complexity of oscillating charge occupation in the probing quantum dot, making thus practical measurements more feasible. We also show how to extract the information of nonadiabatic transition and fermion parity violation caused during moving the MZMs together to fuse, from the initial states prepared with definite fermion parity. All the simulations, including the effective coupling between the fusing MZMs, and their coupling to the probing quantum dot, are based on the lattice model of a Rashba quantum wire in proximity contact with an s-wave superconductor, under the modulation of mini-gate voltage control.</p>

            <p>Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.</p>

            <p>Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials have already reached the stage of trial FAB integration. However, reliability limitations caused by various defects present a serious obstacle for their smooth way forward, especially when scaling the device geometries. Still the ongoing research is mostly focused on pure technology aspects, while reliability is often recalled only when showing a randomly measured gate transfer curve to manifest that the hysteresis is "negligible".In fact the hysteresis dynamics contain unique fingerprints of various mechanisms which may coexist or cancel each other, being more complex in scaled FETs, for instance because of simultaneous interaction of defects with the channel and top gate in thin insulators. To fill this gap, here by doing TCAD modeling for nanoscale MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs we introduce the universal hysteresis mapping method which can correctly capture commonly measured diverse hysteresis dynamics such as conventional clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis, as well as CW/CCW switching and time separation. Next we extend this method to bias-temperature instabilities (BTI) and show a clear correlation between complex hysteresis dynamics and abnormal BTI recovery. Finally, we validate our mapping method using available experimental data for MoS$_2$ FETs and demonstrate that it provides far more accurate results than a conventional constant current extraction of the hysteresis width, being also usable if a CCW hysteresis is caused by mobile ions.</p>

            <p>Computational methods for designing interactions between colloidal particles that induce self-assembly have received much attention for their promise to discover tailored materials. However, it often remains a challenge to translate computationally designed interactions to experiments because they may have features that are too complex, or even infeasible, to physically realize. Toward bridging this gap, we leverage relative-entropy minimization to design pair potentials for binary mixtures of colloidal particles that assemble crystal superlattices. We reduce the dimensionality and extent of the interaction design space by enforcing constraints on the form and parametrization of the pair potentials that are physically motivated by DNA-functionalized nanoparticles. We show that several two- and three-dimensional lattices, including honeycomb and cubic diamond, can be assembled using simple interactions despite their complex structures. We also find that the initial conditions used for the designed parameters as well as the assembly protocol play important roles in determining the outcome and success of the assembly process.</p>

We present dynamic compression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations studying the structural evolution of AM-EHEA AlCoCrFeNi2.1 when compressed to pressures up to 400 GPa. Our in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements capture the appearance of fcc and bcc phases at different pressure conditions, with pure- and mixed-phase regions.

            <p>An important aspect of materials research is the ability to tune different physical properties through controlled alloying. The Ln$_3$M$_4$X$_{13}$ (Ln = Lanthanide, M = Transition Metal, X = Tetrel) filled skutterudite family is of interest due to the tunability of its constituent components and their effects on physical properties, such as superconductivity and complex magnetism. In this work, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ (x = 0 -- 2) was synthesized via excess Sn-flux and characterized using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and heat capacity. Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and its Ge-solid-solution members crystallize in the Pm-3n space group, which has two unique Wyckoff positions for the tetrel (X) site. In the solid solution members, Ge shows preferential occupancy for one of the two Wyckoff sites, reaching $\sim$60$\%$ and 100$\%$ occupancy when x = 1 and 2, respectively. Magnetometry and heat capacity measurements of Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ indicated antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$ = 7.3 K. However, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{12}$Ge and Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{11}$Ge$_2$ showed notably lower-temperature antiferromagnetic phase transitions with substantial peak-broadening at $T_N$ = 5.5 K and 4.1 K, respectively. These data suggest that alloying Ge into Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ causes magnetic frustration within the structure, likely attributable to a change in the density of states from additional Ge $p$ states at the Fermi level. This work demonstrates that preferentially alloying Ge in Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ allows for more precise tunability of its magnetic structure, elucidating design principles for different quantum phases in intermetallic materials.</p>

Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.</p>

            <p>Size polydispersity in colloidal particles can disrupt order in their self-assembly, ultimately leading to a complete suppression of crystallization. In contrast to various computational studies, few experimental studies systematically address the effects of size polydispersity on the quality of colloidal crystals. We present an experimental study of structural order in thin films of crystals vertically dried from colloidal dispersions with a systematically varying polydispersity. As expected, an increase in polydispersity leads to a deterioration in order with significant drops in the local bond-orientational order at 8% and 12% polydispersity. Our results align with previously suggested models of epitaxial-like growth of 2D layers during convective assembly. Our results can offer critical insights into the permissible limits for achieving colloidal crystals from more polydisperse systems such as those synthesized through more sustainable methods.</p>

            <p>Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</p>

            <p>We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena, and we perform a detailed comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative predictions. Our results expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</p>

            <h2>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsung-Cheng Lu, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Yizhi You</p>
            <p>Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory</h2>

            <p>We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.</p>

            <p>Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$, and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t) \sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems, identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of non-integrable behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueda Wen</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems, where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.</p>

            <p>An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics, signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their qubit counterparts.</p>

            <p>We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</p>

Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we propose quantum circuit implementations achievable with current state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems, from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however, such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</p>

            <p>Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</p>

            <p>The investigation of transport characteristics in high-temperature superconductors under magnetic fields is one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics and transport applications. For YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO), the measurements of magnetoresistance under a high magnetic field are technically challenging because the required magnetic field ($B$) to suppress the superconductivity is 100~T class. The low temperature (from 52 to 150 K) longitudinal magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$ab-plane$\parallel$$J$, where $J$ is an electrical current) was measured up to 103~T in optimally doped YBCO thin films. A radio frequency reflection method and the single-turn coil technique were employed. The electrical resistivity $\rho_{ab}$ exhibited a non-saturating magnetoresistance behavior until the highest field region, with the slope $\beta (=d \rho/d B)$ showing a pronounced deviation compared to the transverse magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$c-axis) case. These findings suggest a potential contribution due to the non-orbital origin in the high field phase of YBCO, because the quasiparticle orbital motion is expected to be absent in the longitudinal magnetoresistance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Gr√ºnebohm</p>
            <p>Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.</p>

            <p>Quantifying the entanglement between two continuous bosonic modes, such as magnons and photons, is not trivial. The logarithmic negativity, calculated through the quantum Langevin equations is subjected to thermal noise. However this method requires further approximation. The phase space of a generic nonlinear system contains topologically different regions, and the steady state may correspond to the different types of fixed points, such as Saddle Points, Stable or unstable Spirals, and Nodes. In the present work, we propose a new procedure. Namely, we derived the complete set of nonlinear equations, which includes equations for the magnon and photon number operators and phases. We show that not only number operators but also phases are important for exploring the character of the fixed point, and magnon-photon entanglement. We showed that methods of the qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations are also relevant for photon-magnon entanglement problems. Our main finding is that entanglement is not defined in the Saddle Point region. On the other hand, the maximum of the entanglement corresponds to the region near the border between the Stable node and Stable spiral regions. Our approach is quite general. However, we did calculations for a particular system: photon-magnon crystal based on the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film with the periodic air holes drilled in the film. Our interest focuses on magnons with a particular wavelength and frequency corresponding to the magnon condensate. Those magnons couple strongly with the photons of similar frequency. We discuss in detail the interaction between magnons and photons originating from the magneto-electric coupling and the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that this interaction is responsible for the robust photon-magnon entanglement in the system.</p>

We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom√© metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom√© lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom√© lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom√© metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom√© lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom√© metal FeGe.</p>

            <p>We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field, but the plateaus become much smaller with anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further show the anisotropic effect of the magnon excitations of the 0.6 plateau state using linear spin wave theory. The magnon bandwidth remains small when tuning the anisotropic interactions along the field where the magnetization plateau is stable, while the band becomes more dispersive with anisotropic interactions perpendicular to the field. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the Hamiltonian of the kagome strip chain is dominated by two separate spin chains. This can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in kagome strip chain materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.</p>

            <p>Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Amplitude mode in a multi-gap superconductor MgB$_2$ investigated by terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kota Katsumi, Jiahao Liang, Ralph Romero III, Ke Chen, Xiaoxing Xi, N. P. Armitage</p>
            <p>We have investigated the terahertz (THz) nonlinear response of the multigap superconductor MgB$_2$, using THz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz 2DCS). With broadband THz drive fields, we identified a nonlinear response at twice the lower superconducting gap energy $2\Delta_{\pi}$ at the lowest temperatures. Using narrow-band THz driving pulses, we observed first (FH) and third harmonic responses. The FH intensity shows a monotonic increase with decreasing temperature when properly normalized by the driving field strength. This is distinct from the single-gap superconductor NbN, where the FH signal exhibited a resonant enhancement at temperatures when twice the gap energy $2\Delta$ was resonant with the driving photon energy, which was interpreted to originate from the superconducting amplitude mode. Our results in MgB$_2$ are consistent with a well-defined amplitude mode only at the lowest temperatures and indicate strong damping as temperature increases. This likely indicates the importance of interband coupling in MgB$_2$ and its influence on the nature of the amplitude mode and its damping.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Local Pairs through Nonequilibrium Terahertz Spectroscopy in YBa2Cu3O7-Œ¥ Below Tc</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinzhong Zhang, Qingming Huang, Zhangqiang Yang, Zhiyuan Sun, Ye Yang</p>
            <p>Pairing states are essential to understanding the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Here the non-superconducting state in an optimally doped YBa_2 Cu_3 O_(7-{\delta}) film was driven out of equilibrium by an optical pump with low fluence at a temperature well below the critical temperature (T_c), and its recovery dynamics were exclusively measured using transient terahertz spectroscopy. The pump-fluence dependent experiments unveiled evidence of local pairs without superconductivity coexisting with the superconducting Cooper pairs. An energy gap opening induced by the local pairing with short-range coherence was invoked to rationalize the temperature-dependent recovery time of local pairs with a characteristic divergence at a temperature substantially below T_c. These local pairs displayed remarkable likeness to the short-range pair-density-wave state. Our finding sheds light on understanding the dynamic interplay between the coexisting superconducting and non-superconducting pairs in cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijiang Ji, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>We uncover the emergence of multiple topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) in a 1D spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain driven by Fibonacci modulation, transforming a trivial band structure into a cascade of topologically nontrivial phases. This intriguing phenomenon is marked by the appearance of zero-energy modes and transitions in the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological quantum number. Strikingly, as the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases grows, a behavior intricately linked to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. Unlike conventional TAI phases, which exhibit fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases exhibit multifractal behavior. Furthermore, this model can be experimentally realized in a Bose-Einstein condensate along the momentum lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal properties can be probed through quench dynamics. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic disorder-induced topological phases and their intricate multifractal nature.</p>

            <p>Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However, a second sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, signifying the entrance to the ground state. The ground state appears to have gapped excitations, as even the most abrupt extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K fully accounts for the $R\ln(2)$ entropy associated with the pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$ at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$ for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). For both scenarios, comparison of the measured $C_P$ with NLC calculations suggests that weak interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian become relevant below $T \sim 0.25$ K. The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI). Together with the peak in the heat capacity at $T_1$, this diffuse scattering from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is suggestive of a classical spin liquid regime above $T_1$ that is distinct from the zero-entropy quantum ground state below $T_1$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Bing Luo, Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. However, a topological semimetal that possesses both nodal points and nodal lines is rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this type of topological semimetal, which simultaneously exhibits hinge Fermi arcs and drumhead surface states. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-line structures and its conversion into a first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in a static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, and establish a foundation for further exploration of their potential applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rene Alvarez-Donado, Matias Sepulveda-Macias, Anne Tanguy</p>
            <p>We employed molecular dynamics simulations to explore comparatively the thermo-mechanical behavior of two glass materials-an oxide silica glass (SiO2) and a binary Cu-Zr-based metallic alloy (Cu50Zr50)-during shear and elongation deformation cycles. By calculating the energy balance and tracking the temperature evolution of both glasses under deformation cycles, we are able to propose, for each of them, a constitutive law which accurately reproduces the self-heating process due to plastic deformation. These relatively simple constitutive laws involve strain rate sensitivity and a non-linear temperature dependence of the thermal dilatancy coefficients, as well as strain gradient plasticity. To identify the right parameters, both glasses are equilibrated at very low temperature (10 K) and two independent deformation rates were applied to each sample for each type of deformation. Thermal attenuation is greatly amplified in silica compared to the metallic glass. Moreover, using precise atomic description of the instantaneous deformation, combined with exact coarse-graining procedure, we show, in silica, that self-heating is mainly supported by inhomogeneous strain gradient plasticity with nanometric characteristic lengthscales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jo√£o Costa, Pedro Ribeiro, Andrea De Luca</p>
            <p>We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems of non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under mild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in the thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently introduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge transport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality class, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as the classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies on a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the current is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the cumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact correspondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of noisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show that their transport properties are essentially classical.</p>

            <p>Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the role played by the initial dislocation density which significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. Since the initial micro-structure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be conjectured. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</p>

Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.</p>

            <h2>A collapsed interface approach to resolve grain boundaries in finite element simulations of polycrystalline diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lena Scholz, Yongliang Ou, Blazej Grabowski, Felix Fritzen</p>
            <p>Atomic diffusion affects the properties of various engineering materials, which predominantly occur in the polycrystalline state. A rigorous description of polycrystalline diffusion must therefore account for crystallographic defects, especially grain boundaries (GBs), whose structure and volume fraction - and hence the effective grain size - govern mass transport. Experiments and atomistic simulations consistently show that GBs can accelerate diffusion by up to several orders of magnitude and that fluxes along and across the interface are generally anisotropic. Conventional mesoscale models either neglect GBs or invoke idealized analytical corrections. Fully resolved finite-element meshes are accurate but computationally infeasible when nanometer-thin GB layers are involved. We introduce a collapsed-interface finite element that integrates the GB thickness analytically and embeds the result in a two-dimensional surface element. The formulation (i) treats in-plane and through-plane diffusivity independently, (ii) couples to the surrounding grain matrix without the need for mesh manipulations, and (iii) parametrizes both grain size and GB volume fraction via simple affine scalings, allowing systematic variation without remeshing. Effective diffusivity tensors are extracted by linear computational homogenization. The new finite element reproduces three-dimensional GB transport phenomena - channeled fluxes, concentration discontinuities - at a fraction of the computational cost of explicit models. Parametric studies spanning multiple orders of magnitude in GB diffusivity reveal four distinct diffusion regimes and quantify their impact on the overall response. The framework thus connects atomistic data and continuum predictions, providing an efficient tool for diffusion-driven design and optimization of polycrystalline materials.</p>

We explore how the eigenstates parametrically evolve as the inter-particle interaction is varied, paying attention to the fingerprints of chaos at the quantum phase-transition. Consequently, we demonstrate that the tomographic spectrum reflects the existence of mixed-regions of chaos and quasi-regular motion in phase-space. This tomographic semiclassical approach is much more efficient and informative compared to the traditional "level statistics" inspection. Of particular interest is the characterization of the fluctuations that are exhibited by the many-body eigenstates. In this context, we associate with each eigenstate a Higgs measure for the identification of amplitude modes of the order-parameter. Finally we focus on the formation of the lowest Goldstone and Higgs bands.</p>

            <p>Multi-alkali antimonides (MAAs) are promising materials for vacuum electron sources. While sodium-based MAAs have demonstrated superior characteristics for ultrabright electron sources, their synthesis remains challenging, often resulting in mixed stoichiometries and polycrystalline domains. To address this complexity and guide the characterization of experimentally grown photocathodes, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of four ternary MAAs: cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, representing the experimentally known phase of each stoichiometry, as well as hexagonal Na$_2$KSb and cubic NaK$_2$Sb, two computationally predicted polymorphs. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium and potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and L$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the experimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, particularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing useful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further investigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their counterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting their significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower core levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the experimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA photocathodes, complementing experiments on resolved phases and providing the spectral fingerprints of computationally predicted phases that could emerge in polycrystalline samples.</p>

            <p>Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</p>

Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.</p>

            <h2>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan T. Grimm, Alexander J. Staat, Joel D. Eaves</p>
            <p>The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</p>

            <p>Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdus Salam Sarkar</p>
            <p>The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion & storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchang Cai, Rui-Xing Zhang</p>
            <p>Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moir√© transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Yuhao Shi, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moir√© lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moir√© lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arabinda Bera, Debjyoti Majumdar, Timothy W. Sirk, Ido Regev, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole qubit.

The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier. We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable $s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.</p>

            <h2>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wesley W. Oliver, William M. Jacobs, Michael A. Webb</p>
            <p>Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</p>

            <p>CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruicheng Bao, Zhonghuai Hou</p>
            <p>Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. Specifically, using a simple depolarizing channel, we show that the relaxation of a dissipative transverse-field Ising chain can be significantly accelerated, underscoring the experimental feasibility of the protocol. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</p>

            <p>We study thermalization in a disordered one-dimensional interacting bosonic system described by the Aubry-Andre model using full exact diagonalization. We find a broad chaotic energy window where the system's eigenstates satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), demonstrated by the smooth energy dependence of observables like entanglement entropy and local particle number, whose fluctuations decrease with system size. Dynamically, we investigate the equilibration of initial Fock states and find that thermalization is not universal. The key finding is a direct and nontrivial correlation between an initial state's delocalization in the energy eigenbasis quantified by the Participation Ratio (PR) and its subsequent equilibration. States with a high PR consistently evolve toward the microcanonical ensemble prediction, whereas those exhibiting a low PR display deviations whose magnitude inversely correlates with the PR value. This connection is quantitatively confirmed by the trace distance, providing a powerful, experimentally relevant diagnostic for predicting which initial states will reach thermal equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Liu, Hui Jiang, Wen-Tan Xue, Qingya Li, Jiangbin Gong, Xiaogang Liu, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Wampler, Nigel R. Cooper</p>
            <p>We show that absorbing state phase transitions where the absorbing state itself exhibits long-range phase coherence can lead to critical behavior distinct from directed percolation. To do this, we investigate a simple, purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model, which may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W state with errors. The "error" Lindblad jump operators preserve the W state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates and show that local remnants of the coherence persist in the decohering phase. The distinct critical behavior stems from the spreading of coherence throughout the system at the critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaud Guillin (LMBP), Leo Hahn (LMBP), Manon Michel (LMBP)</p>
            <p>Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated microparticles in microchannel flows. While smooth-walled channels preserve the dependence of particle trajectories on initial orientation and lateral position, we show that introducing periodically textured walls can trigger robust alignment of the particle along the channel centerline. This geometry-driven alignment arises from repeated reorientation torques generated by spatially modulated shear gradients near the textured walls. A resistive force theory-based analysis reveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the elongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at intermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on particle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range for maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low Reynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the Reynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime. These findings offer a predictive framework for designing microfluidic devices that passively sort or focus anisotropic particles, with implications for soft matter transport, biophysical flows, and microfluidic engineering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gopal Chandra Pal, Cheuk Wing Edmond Lam, Chander Shekhar Sharma</p>
            <p>Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Non-coalescence between water droplets has so far been observed during collisions of droplets moving with relative centroidal velocity, or in the presence of specific enabling effects such as high intervening gas pressures, surfactants, or large droplet sizes (diameter $\gtrsim 1~\mathrm{mm}$). Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a much wider range of droplet diameters, from millimeters to as small as 100 microns, without the need for any of the above factors. Such non-coalescence occurs in sessile droplet clusters on water-repellent surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, the evolving interface of the coalescing droplets comes in apparent contact with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster, but does not necessarily trigger further coalescence. In fact, such apparent contact can manifest as a bouncing interaction, and depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, it can result in significant lateral momentum generation, consequently leading to spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of the participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9\% for closely packed clusters of three sessile droplets and increases further with an increase in the number of participating droplets. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.</p>

            <p>The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar√© group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT). We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS. Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</p>

            <p>Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.</p>

            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst</p>
            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Davoodi</p>
            <p>Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N√©el ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Martin Tang Bruland, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and magnon gaps without dissipative currents.</p>

            <h2>ŒΩ-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</p>

            <h2>Multichannel topological Kondo models and their low-temperature conductances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangjie Li, Elio J. K√∂nig, Jukka I. V√§yrynen</p>
            <p>In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator (LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.</p>

            <p>Understanding the generation, transport and capture of charge carriers in semiconductors is of fundamental technological importance. However, the ensemble measurement techniques ubiquitous in electronics offer limited insight into the nanoscale environment that is crucial to the operation of modern quantum-electronic devices. Here, we combine widefield optical microscopy with precision spectroscopy to examine the capture of photogenerated holes by negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. Simultaneous single-shot charge readout over hundreds of individual NVs allows us to resolve the roles of ionized impurities, reveal the formation of space charges fields, and monitor the thermalization of hot photo-carriers during diffusion. We measure effective NV- hole capture radii in excess of 0.2 um, a value approaching the Onsager limit and made possible here thanks to the near-complete neutralization of coexisting charge traps. These results establish a new platform for resolving charge dynamics beyond ensemble averages, with direct relevance to nanoscale electronics and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>High-throughput computational framework for lattice dynamics and thermal transport including high-order anharmonicity: an application to cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Li, Huiju Lee, Chris Wolverton, Yi Xia</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can exceed 50% of total kL in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and Cl2O-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hari Paudyal, Michael E. Flatt√©</p>
            <p>We present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of the long-range charge density wave (CDW) order and superconducting properties of the pristine and lithiated NbSe$_2$ monolayer. Stable CDW structures are obtained through atomic reconstruction driven by soft-mode distortions and lithiation, respectively, lead to significant electronic modifications that suppress the CDW order. This suppression is attributed to anisotropic atomic distortions, along with a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. As a result, the electron--phonon coupling strength is suppressed, particularly in the lithiated structure, due to reduced contributions from low-frequency phonons, primarily associated with in-plane Nb vibrations. Finally, we observe a sizable anisotropy in the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface, with a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 8~K in the distorted, and 4~K in the lithiated, CDW NbSe$_2$ monolayer.</p>

            <p>Unconventional antiferromagnets with spin-split bands, such as noncollinear magnets and the recently discovered altermagnets, serve as new constituents to explore unconventional superconductivity. Here, we unveil a new type and previously unappreciated nature of spin-valley locking in noncollinear antiferromagnets and exploit this texture to achieve pure spin-triplet superconductivity. Using chiral antiferromagnetic kagome lattices (e.g., Mn$_3$Ge and Mn$_3$Ga) coupled to conventional $s$-wave superconductors as prototypical examples, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic chirality strongly favors spin-triplet pairing via superconducting proximity effect, while suppressing spin-singlet pairing in the antiferromagnets away from the interfaces. Crucially, such a long-sought spin-triplet superconducting state is established without invoking the prevailing mechanism of spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Furthermore, the spin-triplet supercurrent is resilient to both in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman fields, which exhibits distinct superiority to Ising superconductivity, serving as a compelling experimental signature of the triplet pairing and spin-valley-locked texture.</p>

            <p>The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems. Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds. While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>A straightforward way to determine the electric field gradient $-$ principal axes frame (EFG-PAF) on single crystal samples with spin 3/2 nuclei is demonstrated. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy is used to determine the Rabi frequency for $^{35}$Cl in a single crystal of potassium chlorate (KClO$_3$) by comparing the NQR signal for powder and single crystal samples. By exploiting the geometrical dependence of the Rabi frequency with respect to the excitation direction, EFG-PAF is readily determined. Furthermore, relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$ were measured at multiple temperatures ranging from $17~\textrm{K}$ to $200 ~$K, extending the results of previous works to colder temperatures where new relaxation mechanisms become dominant. The experiments were performed in a cryogen-free cryostat, which posed distinct challenges compared to a conventional cryogenic cooling setup. The successful operation of the NQR probe within a cryogen-free cryostat has the potential to make the technique more accessible and widen applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Xu Lu, Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</p>

            <p>Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Recent studies reveal that $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents generated via the nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) exhibit significant potential for spintronics applications, with both computational and experimental validations. Addressing the scarcity of conductive altermagnets, we propose strain engineering as a reliable method for inducing altermagnetism. Focusing on rutile-structured $\mathrm{OsO}_2$, first-principles calculations show that minor equibiaxial tensile strain ($\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$=3\%) induces nonmagnetic-to-altermagnetic transitions, achieving an ASSE-driven spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim$7\% -- far surpassing conventional spin Hall angles ($\theta_{\text{IS}}$). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to nonrelativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's nonrelativistic origin. Further investigation reveals that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</p>

            <p>The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccol√≤ Francini, Pedro M. C√¥nsoli, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>Ferrimagnetism appears in the temperature-field phase diagrams of several candidate Kitaev materials, such as the honeycomb cobaltates Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$. In a number of instances, however, the exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of ongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out candidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be reconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined time-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration. Instead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of noncollinear multi-$\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\mathbf q$ discussed in the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by computing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma model with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave theory. If the model realizes a triple-$\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated magnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior observed in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains in the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if the $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground state, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite temperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as expected from the symmetry analysis. The implications of our general result for other Kitaev materials exhibiting ferrimagnetic behavior are also briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT, where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states. Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is crucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena, especially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions, highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We study electron transport in monolayer molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ subjected to a magnetic barrier. Our analysis employs a full-band continuum model to capture the relevant physical phenomena. We focus on how electron energy, magnetic field strength, and the geometric characteristics of the barrier affect the transmission and conductance. We observe sharp resonant tunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by magnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct resonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are closely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in significant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate that adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and valley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron spin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Intermediate-valence behavior is sometimes observed in lanthanide-based materials containing Ce, Yb, Sm or Eu. However, the number of actinide-based systems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we present the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which turns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material shows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K, which can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of intermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the 5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\delta$Eex/kB $\approx$ 400 K and the corresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\approx$ 140 K. The value of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2 signals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical resistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual resistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change of sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at T = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic susceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical analysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice dynamics.</p>

For Th(IV), the $5f$ states are mainly affected by the crystal-field interaction with the closest neighbors as can be seen from the corresponding spectrum of ThO$_2$. In turn, for U(VI) and U(V) oxides, the U $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization and high degree of covalency in the chemical bonding play a decisive role increasing the $5f$ occupancy and consequently governing the ground and excited state properties. That is additionally illustrated by results from the calculations of the U $5d$ x-ray photoemission spectra for U(V) in the lattice of La-doped UO$_2$.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study the electron localization properties of two-dimensional altermagnets subject to disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by convincing numerical evidence and propose a vortex-antivortex-like spin pair picture for its interpretation. Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly affect the spin-splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoresistance. Our findings provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism in candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Failed superconductivity in a Mott spin liquid material</h2>

            <p>A central challenge for understanding unconventional superconductivity in most strongly correlated electronic materials is their complicated band structure and presence of competing orders. In contrast, quasi-two-dimensional organic spin liquids are single-band systems with superconductivity arising near the bandwidth-tuned Mott metal-insulator transition in the absence of other orders. Here, we study chemically substituted $\kappa$-organics in which superconducting fluctuations emerge in the phase coexistence region between the Mott insulator and the Fermi liquid. Using magnetotransport and ac susceptibility measurements, we find that global superconductivity fails to set in as temperature $T\rightarrow 0$. Our results indicate instead the presence of superconducting domains embedded in the metallic percolating cluster that undergo a magnetic field-tuned quantum superconductor-to-metal phase transition. Surprisingly, albeit consistent with the percolation picture, universal conductance fluctuations are seen at high fields in macroscopic samples. The observed interplay of the intrinsic inhomogeneity and quantum phase fluctuations provides a new insight into failed superconductivity, a phenomenon seen in various conventional and unconventional superconductors, including cuprates.</p>

            <p>In moir√© crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations can be tuned by twist angles and stacking orders, forming various symmetry-broken states. Here we report twisted double rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system showing rich moir√© dependent topological phenomena. For small twist angles, programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moir√© filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed multiple first-order transitions and an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator. Interestingly, for a larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1 at fractional fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed, whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is absent. Our study demonstrated the twisted flatbands from rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to study topological correlated physics, offering a promising pathway toward developing new devices for quantum storage and computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre R. Rocha, Rodrigo G. Amorim, Wanderl√£ L. Scopel, Cesar E. P. Villegas</p>
            <p>Vertically stacked van der Waals structures are promising platforms that enable layer engineering, opening new avenues for the quantum control of elementary excitations, including optically generated bound electron-hole pairs. Here we employ excited-state density functional calculations to demonstrate strong interlayer excitonic coupling in one-dimensional van der Waals nanostructures derived from armchair graphene nanoribbons. The excitonic response exhibits prominent peaks in the near-infrared range, mainly attributed to intralayer excitons, while interlayer excitations with absorption peak strengths of up to 13\% of the maximum absorption are also observed. Both type-I and type-II band alignments are found, which promote the formation of intralayer and interlayer excitons. Notably, interlayer excitons in these systems exhibit long-lived radiative lifetimes at room temperature, ranging from 1 nanosecond to 9.4 microseconds. Our calculations suggest the potential to tune the excitonic response and lifetimes of bilayer graphene nanoribbons via careful engineering of the stacking order.</p>

            <p>The emergence of two-dimensional magnets within the van der Waals toolkit has introduced unprecedented opportunities to develop ultrathin spintronic technologies. Strong coupling between spin and optical properties in such materials can further enable novel spin-photonic capabilities of both fundamental and technological interest. Here, we investigate the optical and spin properties of the air-stable, layered A-type antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4) when doped with Yb3+. We show that the collective spin properties of CrPS4 are encoded in the sharp f-f luminescence of isolated Yb3+ dopants via strong magnetic superexchange coupling between the two, and that spontaneous magnetic ordering in CrPS4 induces large exchange splittings in the narrow Yb3+ f-f photoluminescence features below TN. Spin reorientation in CrPS4 via a "spin-flop" metamagnetic transition modulates the Yb3+ f-f luminescence energies and exchange splittings. This pronounced link between spin and optical properties enables the demonstration of optically driven spin-flop transitions in CrPS4.</p>

            <p>The honeycomb magnet Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ recently emerged as a promising candidate for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid with relatively low levels of structural disorder. While the precise spin Hamiltonian remains controversial, the potential existence of a quantum spin liquid or other novel quantum magnetic phases continues to stimulate investigation. Here, we study the temperature and magnetic field-dependent spin excitations of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ on a twin-free single crystal using magneto-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, focusing on magnetic anisotropy and field-induced unusual phases. We observe a low-energy continuum excitation above $T_N$ and a 0.5 THz (2 meV) spin wave excitation in magnetic order under zero field. Upon applying an in-plane magnetic field, the spin waves transform to a magnetic continuum over an intermediate field range, above which the system enters a spin-polarized state. Crucially, the spin excitation spectra reveal striking anisotropy between the $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ crystallographic axes, demanding description by a strongly anisotropic spin model. These findings establish Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ as a model system for investigating field-tunable quantum magnetism and potential spin liquid behavior in highly anisotropic systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fluctuations in two-dimensional altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Cichutek, Peter Kopietz, Andreas R√ºckriegel</p>
            <p>The magnetic properties of two-dimensional altermagnets can be obtained from a square lattice Heisenberg model with antiferromagetic nearest neighbor interaction and two types of next-nearest neighbor interactions arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory we calculate for this model the corrections to the renormalized magnon spectrum and the staggered magnetization to first order in the inverse spin quantum number $1/S$. We also show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the $\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading $1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</p>

            <p>Specific heat is a powerful probe offering insights into the entropy and excitation spectrum of the studied material. While it is well established, a key challenge remains the measurements of microcrystals or thin films especially in the sub-Kelvin, high magnetic field regime. Here we present a setup combining the high sensitivity of SiN$_x$ membrane based calorimetry with the absolute accuracy of Coulomb blockade thermometry to realise a nanocalorimeter for such tasks. The magnetic field independent technique of Coulomb blockade thermometry provides an on-platform thermometer combining a primary thermometry mode for in-situ calibration with a fast secondary mode suitable for specific heat measurements. The setup is validated using measurements of a 20 $\mu$g sample of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ achieving a resolution on the order of 0.1 nJ/K at 500 mK and an absolute accuracy limited by the determination of the sample's mass. Measurements of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ further highlight the benefits of measuring microcrystals with such a device.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Yu. Rudyak, Shahar Shinehorn, Yael Roichman</p>
            <p>In many situations, simply finding a target during a search is not enough. It is equally important to be able to return to that target repeatedly or to enable a larger community to locate and utilize it. While first passage time is commonly used to measure search success, relatively little is known about increasing the average rate of target encounters over time. Here, using an active Brownian particle model with chemotaxis, we demonstrate that when a searcher has no memory and there is no communication among multiple searchers, encoding information about the target's location in the environment outperforms purely memoryless strategies by boosting the overall hit rate. We further show that this approach reduces the impact of target size on a successful search and increases the total utilization time of the target.</p>

            <p>Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface. Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect. Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with high Chern number (C) enables multiple dissipationless edge channels for low-power-consumption electronics. We report the realization of multiple high-C QAH insulators including C=3,5,6, and 7 in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. In twist angles of approximately 1.40¬∞, we observe QAH effect with C=5 at a filling of one electron per moir√© unit cell, persisting up to 2 Kelvin. Furthermore, incommensurate QAH insulators with C=5,6, and 7 emerge at partial fillings. In twist angles of 0.89¬∞, Chern insulators with C=3 and C=6 appear at fillings of two and three electrons, respectively. Our findings establish twisted rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a highly tunable platform for multichannel, dissipationless electronics and for the exploration of exotic quantum Hall states beyond traditional Landau level paradigm.</p>

            <h2>Odd-even parity dependent transport in an annular Kitaev chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Wang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of magnetic flux and the odd-even parity of lattice points $N$ on electron transport in an annular Kitaev chain, with an explanation provided from the energy band perspective. Three transport mechanisms including direct transmission (DT), local Andreev reflection (LAR) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) are considered. In particular, the connection configuration of electrodes to different lattice sites is studied, where the case that the two electrodes connected to the sites are aligned along a diameter is called as symmetric connection and otherwise as asymmetric connections. For even $N$ and asymmetric connection, the vanished LAR and CAR in symmetric connection will emerge as peaks. A more prominent observation is that the symmetry of the two resonant peaks due to DT processes located at $\phi = \pi/3$ and $\phi = 2\pi/3$ for symmetric connection will be broken, and the peak at $\phi = \pi/3$ will be largely reduced, where $\phi$ is the magnetic flux per site. Moreover, the peaks around $\phi = \pi/3$ due to LAR and CAR processes grows drastically even larger than that from DT. For LAR and CAR processes, there is no peak around $\phi = 2\pi/3$ and transmission due to these two processes are completely suppressed for $\phi>\pi/2$. Moreover, it is found that the energy bands vary with $\phi$ in a period of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ for even or odd $N$. These behaviors reflect a complicated competition from DT, LAR and CAR processes and the parity of the lattice number in the Kitaev ring, which will be interested for the quantum device based on Kitaev chain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thorbj√∏rn Skovhus, Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen</p>
            <p>We present an efficient implementation of the magnetic force theorem which allows for direct evaluation of exchange parameters in q-space. The exchange parameters are calculated directly from Bloch states and the implementation does not rely on any mapping onto localized orbitals. This renders the approach well suited for high-throughput computations, where the construction of a localized basis set (for example Wannier functions) often is impractical. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by applying it to yttrium iron garnet, where we obtain excellent agreement with the experimental magnon dispersion without any prior assumptions of important exchange pathways. In particular, the calculations reveal the existence of several inequivalent exchange pathways associated with the same interatomic distances. Performing such calculations in q-space fully accounts for long-range exchange interactions and provides a convenient route for validating models obtained by fitting to inelastic neutron scattering data.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth triangular-lattice magnets serve as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum magnetic phenomena. Recently, the hexaaluminate \cmao\ has been proposed to host a $U(1)$ Dirac quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropy. Here, we report a systematic study of its analogue, \nzao, employing ac susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements establish a well-defined $J_\mathrm{eff}$ = 1/2 ground state with moderate Ising anisotropy ($g_c$ = 4.54, $g_\mathrm{ab}$ = 1.42). Muon spin relaxation measurements reveal persistent fluctuations emerging below $\sim$15\,K, and extending down to at least 0.28 K. AC susceptibility data further indicate an absence of magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50\,mK, despite an overall antiferromagnetic interaction with the Curie-Weiss temprature of $-0.42$\,K. These results suggest that \nzao\ is a good candidate material for realizing a quantum spin liquid state.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for exploring quantum phases from magnetic order in reduced dimensions. While there have been extensive studies on 2D magnetic materials based on 3$d$ electrons, experimental studies on 4$f$-electron counterparts are far fewer, particularly on their electronic structure. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy. Utilizing in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we uncover a large band splitting in the valence bands, which we attribute to the ferromagnetic order driven by exchange couplings between Sm 4$f$ moments and conduction electrons. Despite the small magnetic moment of Sm, the observed splitting is comparable to those of Eu- and Gd-based systems with much larger local moments. Interestingly, the surface state also exhibits splitting with similar magnitude and can be eliminated by overannealing, while the valence bands with ferromagnetic-like splittings remain robust. Our work provides spectroscopic insight to understand the electronic origin of magnetic order in Sm-based compounds. Our study also offers a platform to study 2D magnetic materials based on 4$f$ electrons.</p>

            <p>The influence of Sn alloying additions on the aqueous passivation behavior of Cu-Al alloys was revisited and found to function as a new third element effect in acidified 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The role of each element during the process of aqueous passivation was investigated using electrochemical and surface-sensitive ex-situ and in-operando spectroscopic techniques. The connection between passivation and the atomic arrangements of atoms in the solid solution was supported by first principles based cluster expansion calculations and Monte Carlo simulations probing the chemical short-range order in the Cu-Al-Sn system. High purity Sn, like high purity Cu, did not passivate in the test environment, whereas high purity Al formed a passive film with a stable passive current density of 0.01 mA/cm^2. Cu-xAl-Sn solid solution alloys where x greater than 18 at.%, containing less than 3 at.% Sn additions exhibited lower corrosion rates than Cu-xAl alloys, brought by Al(III) and Sn(IV, II) unidentified complex oxides formation on the surface. A strong influence of Sn on Al(III) passivation was observed, i.e., strongly suggesting a third element effect type behavior. Possible governing processes explaining the stainless steel type corrosion behavior are discussed, providing insights for exploring novel synergies in the design of corrosion resistant alloys.</p>

            <p>Optical lattice clocks have set records in clock precision and accuracy. Continuing to advance their performance, via probing as many atoms for the longest interrogation time affordable, requires experimentally and theoretically studying a many-body lattice system. Motivated by recent experimental results on a Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice clock, we present a theoretical overview of Ramsey and Rabi spectroscopy in one-dimensional chains. At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement conditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\approx 1-5$ atoms. We show that in the presence of spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock laser, the spectroscopy observables are modified by superexchange interactions within each chain, and depend strongly on the length of the chain. The thermal distribution of chain lengths thus plays a key role in the spectroscopy measurements. Our results offer insight into observable many-body effects in state-of-the-art lattice clocks and suggest new directions for optimizing clock performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Venkata Rama Manoj Pola, Alexey Lyulin</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the influence of resin composition on the thermal and structural properties of crosslinked epoxy networks using molecular-dynamics simulations. The systems studied are based on mixtures of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and butylated epoxy resin (BER), cured with diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). A multi-step crosslinking algorithm was used to generate highly crosslinked networks. We systematically explored how the addition of BER affects the network topology and thermophysical behavior of the resulting thermosets. Our results show that increasing BER content leads to a progressive loosening of the network, evidenced by longer inter-nitrogen path lengths and larger Voronoi atomic volumes. This structural loosening results in a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and higher atomic mobility as well as a reduction in the glass-transition temperature. To quantify local steric and topological effects, we introduce a confinement index that captures atomic-level crowding and connectivity. The index shows a strong correlation with the observed trend in glass-transition temperature, suggesting its potential as a predictive descriptor for polymer network behavior. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into how epoxy resin composition modulates network structure and thermomechanical properties.</p>

            <p>Cuprate superconductors have attracted extensive attention due to high critical temperatures. Conventional cuprates typically contain perfect CuO$_2$ planes which are considered as a key factor to superconductivity since the superconductivity takes place in them. However, in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ with $\delta=0.2$ and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes, superconductivity still arises even with a transition temperature as high as 73 K. Using combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we investigated the electronic correlation and electronic structure of Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.25}$ with alternating quasi-one-dimensional (1D) CuO planes and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes. We find that although different from the usual cuprates, the Cu atoms are still dominated by a 3$d^9$ configuration and the system is of a new kind of correlated single-orbital physics. The quasi-1D CuO planes, composed of parallel Cu-O chains, are slightly hole-doped quasi-1D Mott insulator, while the O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes are more hole doped, with a 2D correlated electronic structure, and may host superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Timescales for stochastic barrier crossing: inferring the potential from nonequilibrium data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. J. Archer, T. Ala-Nissila, T. J. W. Honour, S. P. Fitzgerald</p>
            <p>Kramers' rate theory forms a cornerstone for thermally activated barrier crossing. However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on obtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium. Instead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system of a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a double-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path integral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key timescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE and SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a well at time $t \ll \tau_{\rm B}$, where $\tau_{\rm B}$ is the Brownian diffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point appears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t \lessapprox \tau_{\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential well can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly, this timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant deviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \gg \tau_{\rm B}$. We further calculate \red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric potentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory at a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height. Our results have important implications for controlling activated processes at finite times and demonstrate the importance of reaching long enough times to faithfully construct potential landscapes from experimental or simulation data.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiesen Guo, Fan Yang, Yuzhou He, Xinyang Liu, Zheng Deng, Qinghua Zhang, Xiancheng Wang, Xianlei Sheng, Wei Li, Changqing Jin, Kan Zhao</p>
            <p>We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.</p>

            <h2>High temperature modulations, meso-scale interactions and hyperscaling breakdown in Ising models with frustration: some insights from thermodynamic geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumen Khatua, Riekshika Sanwari, Vikram Patil, Anurag Sahay</p>
            <p>In this work we revisit the Axial Third Nearest Neighbour Ising (A3NNI) chain and examine in detail some aspects of its phase behaviour ensuing from competing interactions and resulting frustration. We probe the phase behaviour with two complimentary tools: a microscopic two-point correlation function $\mathcal{C}(n)$ which we carefully construct after appropriate spin transformations, and a macroscopic, thermodynamic curvature $R$ which we obtain from the free entropy. We report novel observations of phenomena such as hyperscaling breakdown and intermediate-ranged modulations among others. The zero field thermodynamic curvature $R_0$ is shown to systematically sub-divide the ground state phases into regions of attractive or repulsive effective interactions of varying strength. Furthermore, $R_0$ brings forth the significance of some third order moments in describing the effects of frustration, including the multiphase lines. Combined use of both the probes in the short-ranged modulated order regime confirms and further clarifies the discussion in [1] regarding the appropriate measure of high temperature correlation length in this regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebasti√°n Alberti, Thierry Brotin, Jana J√°gersk√°</p>
            <p>Since the affinity of Cryptophane-A for methane was first reported in 1993, cryptophane-doped polymer films have been extensively studied as enrichment cladding layers in plasmonic, fiber-optic, and integrated waveguide-based optical sensors. While the use of cryptophane-doped layers has improved methane sensitivity compared to undoped claddings, controversy has grown over the years regarding their claimed selectivity and practical applicability. Key questions remain unresolved, including the extent of true methane enrichment at room temperature, cross-sensitivity to other gases, and the proportion of active cryptophane molecules within the polymer matrix. In this work, we employ Raman spectroscopy to provide direct and unambiguous evidence that Cryptophane-A exhibits measurable affinity for major ambient gases other than methane at room temperature. Notably, both nitrogen and carbon dioxide are shown to enter the cryptophane cavity and compete with methane for binding sites. This study underscores the value of Raman spectroscopy as a benchmark technique for investigating gas capture within host molecules at ambient conditions. It offers deeper insight into the binding behavior of Cryptophane-A and enables quantification of its relative affinities to atmospheric gases, thereby revealing both the limitations and the potential of cryptophane for future sensing applications.</p>

            <h2>Spectral Feature Extraction for Robust Network Intrusion Detection Using MFCCs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HyeYoung Lee, Muhammad Nadeem, Pavel Tsoi</p>
            <p>The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks. Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network landscapes.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Relations, Morphological Stability, and Asymptotic Freedom of Plasma-Surface Deposition Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Saucedo, Uday Lamba, Hasitha Mahabaduge</p>
            <p>Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure remains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely confined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop a predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG) analysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the plasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles. The central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic freedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the growing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales, a finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of continuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG framework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area, $\langle A \rangle \propto \exp(\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by fundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\Phi$) and ion collision time ($\tau_{\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed empirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to specific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable predictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within collision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\Lambda_c = 1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on crystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine for predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer R√©nyi Entropy Encodes Fusion Rules of Topological Defects and Boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Hoshino, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the stabilizer R√©nyi entropy (SRE), a computable measure of quantum magic, can serve as an information-theoretic probe for universal properties associated with conformal defects in one-dimensional quantum critical systems. Using boundary conformal field theory, we show that open boundaries manifest as a universal logarithmic correction to the SRE, whereas topological defects yield a universal size-independent term. When multiple defects are present, we find that the universal terms in the SRE faithfully reflect the defect-fusion rules that define noninvertible symmetry algebra. These analytical predictions are corroborated by numerical calculations of the Ising model, where boundaries and topological defects are described by Cardy states and Verlinde lines, respectively.</p>

            <p>Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</p>

            <p>We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems. Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to describe subtle quantum behaviors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sara Finocchiaro, Giovanni Luilli, Giuliano Benenti, Matteo G. A. Paris, Luca Razzoli</p>
            <p>In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</p>

            <p>Batteries are critical for electrified transportation and aviation, yet thermodynamic understanding of electrode materials remains lacking, as indicated by the often-seen violation of the second law of thermodynamics of open-circuit voltage (OCV) models. On the other hand, thermodynamic modeling rarely utilizes electrochemical data such as OCV, entropic heat (dOCV/dT), which contains rich thermodynamic information. This work introduces a framework of thermodynamic modeling of materials for electrochemical energy storage, using differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization of thermodynamic parameters. Using a modified Debye model that accounts for the phonon density of states, the thermodynamics of pure substances is modeled from experimental measurements of specific heat ($c_p$) as well as the phonon density of states $g(\omega)$. Thermodynamics of mixing is modeled with measured entropic heat and OCV data. We demonstrate the differentiable thermodynamic modeling framework with forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, i.e. determining phase diagram of graphite anode given thermochemical and electrochemical data, we show that in addition to accurate reproduction of phase diagram of LixC6, the fitted temperature-dependent OCV of graphite reaches 3.8 mV mean absolute error (MAE) for test set data measured at 10$^\circ$C, compared with 2.9-3.6 mV MAE for training set data measured at 25$^\circ$C - 57$^\circ$C. In the inverse problem, i.e. determining OCV of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode from phase diagram constrained by thermochemical and electrochemical data, we demonstrate accurate reproduction of LFP OCV as well as phase diagram. This framework offers a unified treatment of chemical and electrochemical thermodynamic data for electrode materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Wang, Zhi-Cheng Yang, Tianci Zhou, Xiao Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional random free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that can exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the Stabilizer R√©nyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect sampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the system transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase, the structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This transition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information, which exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic scaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase. Additionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes extensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation time to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic random circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation time that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for the critical nature of the phase.</p>

            <h2>Disordered pinning models with contact number constraint</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giambattista Giacomin, Marco Zamparo</p>
            <p>Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called \emph{contacts}. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this \emph{big jump phenomenon} is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</p>

Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</p>

Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite number of spin operators on different sites.

            <p>Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.</p>

            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

            <h2>Temporal Brewster anomaly and collimated wave steering in Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>Temporal disorder-random temporal fluctuations of material parameters-has recently emerged as an effective tool for controlling wave propagation, analogous to Anderson localization in spatially disordered systems. Here, we theoretically introduce and analyze the temporal Brewster anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems, demonstrating that Dirac waves remain delocalized along a vector potential with fixed direction despite random temporal variations in its magnitude. In contrast, waves propagating at any off-axis angle exhibit pronounced spatial localization and diffusive behavior. This directional selectivity arises from temporal impedance matching, previously identified as the mechanism suppressing temporal reflection along the vector potential axis. By analyzing temporal reflectance, wave group velocity, and pulse propagation, we establish that these systems function as dynamic directional filters, achieving collimated wave steering purely through temporal modulation. In Dirac materials, external electric fields or mechanical strain can dynamically control the orientation and strength of the vector potential modulation, enabling precise, real-time tuning of directional wave transmission. The temporal Brewster anomaly thus offers a robust and versatile approach for adaptive wave steering, promising significant technological applications in electronic and photonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic waves in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, exponential behavior at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields true log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated by extensive calculations using two complementary disorder models-delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations-demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry and temporal dynamics. Momentum conservation further constrains long-term behavior, linking initial conditions to energy growth. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.</p>

            <p>We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa>1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations reveal that these edge states exhibit robust localization and characteristic nodal structures, with their properties strongly dependent on the edge configurations of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states (emerging for $\kappa \ge 4$) are fragile and disappear under strong disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.</p>

            <p>A mixture of light-gas particles and Brownian heavy particles is analyzed within the framework of a post-Newtonian Boltzmann equation to determine the Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion. For each species, the equilibrium distribution function refers to the corresponding post-Newtonian Maxwell-J√ºttner distribution function. The expressions for the friction viscous coefficient in the first and second post-Newtonian approximations are determined, and we show their dependence on the corresponding gravitational potentials. A linear stability analysis in the Newtonian and post-Newtonian Fokker-Planck equations for the Brownian motion is developed, where the perturbations are assumed to be plane harmonic waves of small amplitudes. From a dispersion relation it follows that: (i) for perturbation wavelengths smaller than the Jeans wavelength two propagating modes -- corresponding to harmonic waves in opposite directions -- and one mode that does not propagate show up; (ii) for perturbation wavelengths bigger than the Jeans wavelength the time evolution of the perturbation corresponds to a growth or a decay and the one which grows refers to the instability.</p>

            <h2>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fatemeh Davoodi</p>
            <p>Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N√©el ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</p>

            <h2>Mesoscopic Fluctuations and Multifractality at and across Measurement-Induced Phase Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Poboiko, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin</p>
            <p>We explore statistical fluctuations over the ensemble of quantum trajectories in a model of two-dimensional free fermions subject to projective monitoring of local charge across the measurement-induced phase transition. Our observables are the particle-number covariance between spatially separated regions, $G_{AB}$, and the two-point density correlation function, $\mathcal{C}(r)$. Our results exhibit a remarkable analogy to Anderson localization, with $G_{AB}$ corresponding to two-terminal conductance and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ to two-point conductance, albeit with different replica limit and unconventional symmetry class, geometry, and boundary conditions. In the delocalized phase, $G_{AB}$ exhibits ``universal'', nearly Gaussian, fluctuations with variance of order unity. In the localized phase, we find a broad distribution of $G_{AB}$ with $\overline{-\ln G_{AB}} \sim L $ (where $L$ is the system size) and the variance $\mathrm{var}(\ln G_{AB}) \sim L^\mu$, and similarly for $\mathcal{C}(r)$, with $\mu \approx 0.5$. At the transition point, the distribution function of $G_{AB}$ becomes scale-invariant and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ exhibits multifractal statistics, $\overline{\mathcal{C}^{q}(r)}\sim r^{-q(d+1) - \Delta_{q}}$. We characterize the spectrum of multifractal dimensions $\Delta_q$. Our findings lay the groundwork for mesoscopic theory of monitored systems, paving the way for various extensions.</p>

            <h2>Solving Distance-Based Optimization Problems Using Optical Hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyao Li, Richard Zhipeng Wang, Natalia G. Berloff</p>
            <p>We present a practical approach to solving distance-based optimization problems using optical computing hardware. The objective is to minimize an energy function defined as the weighted sum of squared differences between measured distances and the squared Euclidean distances of point coordinates. By representing coordinates as complex numbers, we map the optimization problem onto optical fields, enabling its solution through either the canonical transformation (CT) method or the gain-based bifurcation (GBB) method. To further enhance the performance of the CT method, we introduce two techniques: asynchronous update and steepened gradient. Both the CT and GBB methods can effectively solve the distance-based problem and are adaptable to various optical hardware platforms. Our optical implementation is inspired by recent progress in analog optical computing for combinatorial optimization, highlighting its promise for efficient and scalable problem-solving in high-dimensional settings.</p>

            <h2>Subharmonic Shapiro steps in depinning dynamics of a 2D solid dusty plasma modulated by 1D nonlinear deformed periodic substrates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoye Wang, Nichen Yu, Ao xu, Chen Liang, C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt, Yan Feng</p>
            <p>Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional solid dusty plasma, which is modulated by one-dimensional nonlinear deformed periodic substrates, and also driven by the combination of the DC and AC forces. As the DC driving force increases gradually, pronounced subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are discovered under the combined modulation of the deformed substrate and the external AC drive. These observed subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are attributed to the dynamic mode locking. The data analysis results indicate that the nonlinear deformed substrate strongly influences these subharmonic Shapiro steps, which can be accurately diagnosed using the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles. Furthermore, the diagnostic of the kinetic temperature clearly indicates the difference between harmonic and subharmonic Shapiro steps, i.e., the particle motion is slightly less synchronized at subharmonic Shapiro steps, caused by the unstable locations of the deformed substrate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danish Ali Hamza, Jan Chwede≈Ñczuk</p>
            <p>Quantum effects, such as entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell correlations, can enhance metrological sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. These correlations are typically generated through interactions between atoms or molecules, or during the passage of a laser pulse through a birefringent crystal. Here, we consider an alternative method of generating scalable, many-body entangled states, and demonstrate their usability for quantum-enhanced metrology. Our setup is a one-dimensional (1D) array of double-well potentials holding independent and uncorrelated Bose-Einstein condensates. The beam-splitting transformation mixes the signal between adjacent wells and yields a strongly entangled state through a many-body equivalent of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We demonstrate this entanglement can improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In our analysis, we account for the effects of atomic fluctuations and identify the optimal measurement that saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.</p>

            <h2>Simulating and Sampling from Quantum Circuits with 2D Tensor Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel S. Rudolph, Joseph Tindall</p>
            <p>Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field. Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ans√§tze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a dual magneto-optical trap of $^{109}$Ag and $^{39}$K. For silver, a decreasing-field Zeeman slower loads a MOT of $1.5{\times}10^8$ atoms at a temperature of 0.74(5) mK, with laser cooling occurring primarily on the $D_2$ line of $4d^{10}5s\; {}^2S_{1/2}\rightarrow 5p\; {}^2P_{3/2}$ at 328 nm. We create a novel Ag "dark spot MOT," where shelving the atoms in a dark state enhances the captured atom number by a factor of two and the lifetime by a factor of four. For potassium, we obtain $2{\times}10^8$ trapped atoms, and further cooling on the $D_1$ transition via grey molasses results in a cloud of $1.2{\times} 10^8$ atoms at 7(1) $\mu$K. We observe evidence of photoionization loss of the K MOT in the presence of Ag laser-cooling light, with implications for optimal dual species loading strategies. Our results on Ag point to simple and general laser cooling strategies for other coinage metals (Au, Cu). Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for the production of alkali-coinage metal degenerate quantum mixtures and highly polar molecules.</p>

            <p>The stability of long-range order against quenched disorder is a central problem in statistical mechanics. This paper develops a generalized framework extending the Ding-Zhuang method and integrated with the Pirogov-Sinai framework, establishing a systematic scheme for studying phase transitions of long-range order in disordered systems. We axiomatize the Ding-Zhuang approach into a theoretical framework consisting of the Peierls condition and a local symmetry condition. For systems in dimensions $d \geq 3$ satisfying these conditions, we prove the persistence of long-range order at low temperatures and under weak disorder, with multiple coexisting distinct Gibbs states. The framework's versatility is demonstrated for diverse models, providing a systematic extension of Peierls methods to disordered systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanaprom Cholsuk, Tobias Vogl, Viktor Iv√°dy</p>
            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Opinion dynamics, the study of how individual beliefs and collective public opinion evolve, is a fertile domain for applying statistical physics to complex social phenomena. Like physical systems, societies exhibit macroscopic regularities from localized interactions, leading to outcomes such as consensus or fragmentation. This field has grown significantly, attracting interdisciplinary methods and driven by a surge in large-scale behavioral data. This review covers its rapid progress, bridging the literature dispersion. We begin with essential concepts and definitions, encompassing the nature of opinions, microscopic and macroscopic dynamics. This foundation leads to an overview of empirical research, from lab experiments to large-scale data analysis, which informs and validates models of opinion dynamics. We then present individual-based models, categorized by their macroscopic phenomena (e.g., consensus, polarization, echo chambers) and microscopic mechanisms (e.g., homophily, assimilation). We also review social contagion phenomena, highlighting their connection to opinion dynamics. Furthermore, the review covers common analytical and computational tools, including stochastic processes, treatments, simulations, and optimization. Finally, we explore emerging frontiers, such as connecting empirical data to models and using AI agents as testbeds for novel social phenomena. By systematizing terminology and emphasizing analogies with traditional physics, this review aims to consolidate knowledge, provide a robust theoretical foundation, and shape future research in opinion dynamics.</p>

            <p>Disorder and non-Hermitian effects together can upend how waves localize. In a 1D disordered chain, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can induce Anderson delocalization, defying the usual rule that disorder in low dimensions always localizes states. While weak disorder leaves the NHSE intact, strong disorder restores Anderson localization. Here, we study a surprising twist: coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorder anti-symmetrically correlated. Strikingly, once the inter-chain coupling exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes Anderson delocalization irrespective of disorder strength, reinstating the NHSE with no Hermitian counterpart. This transition arises from the interplay of non-reciprocal hopping, inter-chain coupling, and engineered disorder correlations, and is captured by a real-space winding number. To confirm this, we build an electrical-circuit analog and directly observe the re-emergent NHSE via voltage measurements. Our work uncovers unexplored and experimentally accessible physics at the crossroads of non-Hermiticity and disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Gang Su</p>
            <p>Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Here we investigate the intriguing interplay between Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization in a two-orbital model for bilayer nickelates, using a comprehensive tensor network approach: density matrix renormalization group for finite-size systems, infinite projected entangled-pair states in the thermodynamic limit, and thermal tensor networks for finite-temperature properties. We explain the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity observed in experiment, by identifying three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\mathrm{SC}}$. However, the former exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$, below which the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\mathrm{SC}}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\mathrm{SC}}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances with pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>Metallic hydrogen and hydride materials stand as promising avenues to achieve room-temperature superconductivity. Characterized by their high phonon frequencies and moderate coupling strengths, several high-pressure hydrides were theoretically predicted to exhibit transition temperatures ($T_c$) exceeding 250\,K, a claim further substantiated by experimental evidence. In an effort to push $T_c$ beyond room temperature, we introduce a dynamical method that involves stimulating hydrides with mid-infrared lasers. Employing Floquet first-principles simulations, we observe that in a nonequilibrium state induced by light, both the electronic density of states and the coupling to high-energy phonons see notable enhancements. These simultaneous improvements collectively result in an estimated 20\%-30\% rise in $T_c$ in practical pump conditions. Our theoretical investigation, therefore, offers a novel strategy to potentially raise the $T_c$ of hydrides above room temperature.</p>

            <p>The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals materials, with their layered structure, provide an optimal platform for probing such physical phenomena. However, achieving a facile and effective means to manipulate exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures remains challenging. In this study, we investigate the origin of exchange bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures. Our work demonstrates a method to modulate unidirectional exchange anisotropy, achieving an unprecedented nearly 1000% variation through simple thermal cycling. Despite the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS3, magneto-transport measurements reveal a huge 170 mT exchange bias at 5 K, one of the largest observed in van der Waals antiferromagnet-ferromagnet interfaces. This substantial magnitude of the exchange bias is linked to an anomalous weak ferromagnetic ordering in MnPS3 below 40 K. On the other hand, the tunability of exchange bias during thermal cycling is ascribed to the modified arrangement of interfacial atoms and changes in the vdW gap during field cooling. Our findings highlight a robust and easily adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic heterostructures, presenting a straightforward approach to enhance other interface-related spintronic phenomena for practical applications. A detailed study of the interface reveals migration of atoms between the layers, leading to the formation of amorphous region on either side of the van der Waals gap, underscoring the importance of precise characterization of interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, which are often presumed to have pristine interfaces.</p>

            <p>Kagome lattice can host abundant exotic quantum states such as superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW). Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM), CDW and canted AFM have been manifested upon cooling in kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of CDW and interaction with magnetism remains unclear. Here we investigate the evolution of CDW with temperature across the canted AFM by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). Interestingly, CDW-induced superlattice reflections become weak after the canted AFM, although long-range CDW order is still detectable by STM and REXS. We uncover a novel long-range CDW order with suppressed structural modulation, likely due to the competition for the underlying crystal structure between CDW and canted AFM. Additionally, occupational modulations of Ge1 in the kagome plane and displacive modulations of all atoms were extracted. The results confirm Ge dimerization along the c axis and suggest a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.</p>

            <p>We develop a microscopic theory for nonlinear optical response of moir√© exciton-polaritons in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our theory allows to study the tunnel-coupled intralayer and interlayer excitonic modes for a wide range of twist angles ($\theta$), external electric field, and light-matter coupling, providing insights into the hybridization regime inaccessible before. Specifically, we account for the Umklapp scattering processes of two exciton-polaritons responsible for enhanced nonlinearity, and show that it is crucial for describing interactions at strong hybridization. We reveal a regime of attractive nonlinearity for moir√© polaritons, stemming from the anisotropic Coulomb interactions, which can explain some of experimental features of optical response in TMD bilayers. Furthermore, within our theory we demonstrate that the attractive nonlinearity can be tuned into repulsive by applying an external electric field.

            <p>We investigate the stability of persistent currents in superfluid fermionic gases confined to a ring geometry. Our study, conducted at zero temperature using time-dependent density functional theory, cover interaction regimes from strong (unitary Fermi gas) to weak (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime) couplings. Stability is tested against the presence of an external defect within the ring. The dissipation mechanism associated with vortex generation is present in all interaction regimes. Vortex emission is accompanied by Cooper pair breaking, which occurs even beyond the vortex core in the weakly interacting regime. The pair-breaking mechanism prevents the imprinting of a persistent current with a winding number above a threshold, which decreases as the system approach the BCS regime. Our study reveals the existence of two types of critical winding numbers above which currents cease to be persistent in Fermi superfluids: one related to the proliferation of quantum vortices and the other to the onset of the pair-breaking mechanism.</p>

            <p>Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</p>

            <h2>Anharmonic quantum muon effects of light particles in a spin liquid material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Hotz, Matja≈æ Gomil≈°ek, Tina Arh, Thomas Hicken, Polona Umek, Andrej Zorko, Hubertus Luetkens</p>
            <p>The quantum behavior of light nuclei and other particles in materials challenges classical intuition and introduces novel phenomena. Here we demonstrate that muon spin spectroscopy ( $\mu$SR) is a powerful tool for exploring the quantum effects of light particles, such as the muon, in condensed matter. The muon's quantum nature is profoundly influenced by the surrounding, offering a unique probe for understanding the role of light atoms and their role in shaping local electronic environments. In Zn-barlowite, a candidate quantum spin liquid, we show that standard density functional theory (DFT) methods, which treat the muon as a classical point-like particle, fail to capture its strong quantum anharmonic effects. Only by modeling the muon as a spatially extended quantum particle, thus accounting for the anharmonicity, can the experimental $\mu$SR data be understood. This approach not only improves the interpretation of $\mu$SR results but also opens the door to studying the quantum effects of other light particles, like hydrogen and lithium nuclei, which can greatly influence material properties.</p>

            <h2>Ambient condition superconductivity via engineered polaronic environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Kempa, Michael J. Naughton</p>
            <p>A vanishing dielectric function is required for longitudinal plasmonic or polaronic modes in a polarizable uniform medium and, in general, heralds the presence of singular charge fluctuations. It is also known that a vanishing dielectric function of an environment strengthens Cooper pairing in a superconductor via resonant anti-shielding (RAS), regardless of pairing origin. We combine these notions in a strategy to strongly enhance superconductivity. Specifically, we propose a superlattice of an ultrathin superconductor film in direct contact with a monolayer of a metal-organic framework material. This structure possesses a momentum-independent and resonant effective dielectric function, a key feature for RAS-enhanced superconductivity. We show that the superlattice facilitates near perfect volumetric intermixing between the superconductor and the engineered dielectric environment. To estimate the critical temperature $T_c$ enhancement, we use the unrestricted Leuven's scaling method, which relates the spectral integral of the RAS-renormalized Eliashberg function $\alpha^2$F to $T_c$, which we showed previously to be in excellent agreement with ab initio simulations, and which we posit may underlie recent observations of enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe on SrTiO$_3$. We carried out a renormalization of the bare $\alpha^2$F, dividing it directly by |$\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)|^2$, where $\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)$ is the q-independent dielectric function of the dielectric environment. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in the RAS scheme. We also calculated the quantum Fisher information from the dynamic charge susceptibility in the normal state (for vanishing losses) in our proposed superlattice, and our estimate suggests the presence of superconductivity signatures well above $T_c$ due to quantum charge entanglement buildup.</p>

A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a data assimilation model for the bandgap of (Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$.

            <p>ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is the prototypical example of a material exhibiting negative thermal expansion (NTE). It is now widely accepted that in ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$, and in many other framework materials exhibiting NTE, a collection of low energy phonon modes, as opposed to just one or two, are responsible for the anomalous thermal properties. However, quantitative verification and analysis of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations which underpin this proposal are still lacking. In particular, probing the low energy phonons directly throughout reciprocal space using inelastic neutron scattering, as opposed to other techniques which only probe the Brillouin zone center, is technically challenging and hence rarely done. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements in a large number of Brillouin zones over a 400 K temperature range. We find excellent agreement between DFT calculations and experimental data at low temperature. However, the shifts in phonon modes predicted by DFT due to the reduction in lattice parameter (warming) are not observed. This is most likely due to counteractive anharmonic effects, which we verified using finite temperature molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Notwithstanding, both DFT and MD results are consistent with NTE in ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ arising from the tension effect, and by extension this explanation is supported by the neutron scattering results.</p>

The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both the wave vector $\vec{q}$ and the phonon frequency $\omega$. To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with frozen-phonon multislice calculations predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10--20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of considering phonon-specific behavior in ultrafast dynamics.</p>

            <p>Multi-Q magnetic structures on two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a key route to realizing topological physics in 2D magnetism. A major experimental challenge is to unambiguously confirm their formation by excluding the possibility of topologically trivial multi-domain single- or double-Q magnetic orders, which cannot be distinguished using conventional diffraction techniques. Here, we propose that long-wavelength spin dynamics offers a universal diagnostic for triangular lattices: triple-Q orders that preserve rotational symmetry and single- or double-Q orders that break it exhibit qualitatively distinct anisotropies in their Goldstone mode velocities, stemming from fundamental differences in their underlying spin configurations. We validate this concept using the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_{2}$, which hosts both a stripe-type single-Q state and a triple-Q tetrahedral ordering at different temperatures. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and spin dynamics simulations, we first refine the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the paramagnetic excitation spectra, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. We then show that the observed velocity profiles of the Goldstone modes agree with the high-temperature model's predictions: markedly anisotropic for the single-Q phase and near isotropic for the triple-Q phase. Importantly, this contrast persists across various exchange parameters, highlighting its model-independent nature and suggesting potential applicability to other 2D lattice systems. This work provides universal insight into the dynamical properties of topological multi-Q magnetic orderings in 2D lattice structures, offering a broadly applicable diagnostic to distinguishing them from topologically trivial single- or double-Q counterparts.

            <h2>Purely electrical detection of the spin-splitting vector in $p$-wave magnets based on linear and nonlinear conductivities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>A $p$-wave magnet has a momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero-net magnetization just as in the case of an altermagnet. It will be useful for high-density and ultra-fast memory, where the direction of the spin-splitting vector may be used as a bit. The spin-splitting vector corresponds to the N√©el vector in altermagnets. However, it is a nontrivial problem to detect the spin-splitting vector in a $p$-wave magnet because time-reversal symmetry is preserved, while this is not a problem in an altermagnet because the anomalous Hall conductivity is present due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show that it is possible to detect the in-plane component of the spin-splitting vector in the $p$-wave magnet by measuring the linear transverse and longitudinal Drude conductivity. Remarkably, this measurement is possible without using magnetization. Furthermore, we study the nonlinear Drude conductivity, the quantum-metric and the Berry curvature dipole induced nonlinear conductivity in the presence of tiny magnetization along the $z$\ axis. It is possible to detect the $z$-component of the spin-splitting vector by measuring the above nonlinear conductivities. We obtain analytic formulae for them in the first-order perturbation theory, which agree quite well with numerical results without perturbation.</p>

            <p>Manipulating magnetism at the THz timescale in atomically thin ferromagnets by exploiting the interactions of spins with optical phonon modes presents an innovative idea for THz spintronics and magnonics. Utilizing the coupling of phonon modes to the magnetization could lead to new ways of generating and controlling spin wave excitations in future applications. We use femtosecond optical laser pulses to generate excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, in bulk-like ferromagnet CrI3 flakes and probe the subsequent charge and spin dynamics with optical pump-probe spectroscopy. In CrI3, exciton formation is known to drive coherent optical phonon modes with 2.4 and 3.9 THz frequencies corresponding to the bending and stretching of the Cr-I bonds. We show that both phonon modes also lead to magnetization oscillations. This establishes spin-phonon coupling for both modes, contrary to previous observations that only report the 3.9 THz phonon mode can influence the CrI3 magnetization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan-Niklas Herre, Qiyu Liu, Roman Rausch, Christoph Karrasch, Dante M. Kennes</p>
            <p>We investigate the ergodicity-to-localization transition in interacting fermion systems subjected to a spatially uniform electric field. For that we employ the recently proposed Tensorflow Equations (TFE), a type of continuous unitary flow equations. This enables us to iteratively determine an approximate diagonal basis of the quantum many-body system. We present improvements to the method, which achieves good accuracy at small to intermediate interaction strengths, even in the absence of an electric field or disorder. Then, we examine two quantities that reveal the fate of Stark MBL in 1D and 2D. First, we investigate the structure of the resulting basis to determine the crossover between ergodic and localized regimes with respect to electric field strength. Second, we simulate long-time dynamics at infinite temperature. Our results in 1D show a localization transition at non-zero field for finite interaction that vanishes with increasing system size leading to localization at infinitesimally small field even in the presence of interactions. In 2D we find less clear signatures of localization and strong finite size effects. We establish that the TFE work accurately up to intermediate times but cannot capture higher order effects in interaction strength that lead to delocalization at longer times in finite-size Stark MBL systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Palash Saha, Louk Rademaker, Micha≈Ç Zegrodnik</p>
            <p>We study, the interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir√© MoTe\(_2\)/WSe\(_2\) heterobilayer. In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporates the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir√© unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferrimagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state. We discuss the obtained results in the context of available experimental data.</p>

            <p>Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan \textit{et al.} [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)}] and Chen \textit{et al.} [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)}], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</p>

            <p>Transition-metal ions with $5d^2$ electronic configuration in a cubic crystal field are prone to have a vanishing dipolar magnetic moment but finite higher-order multipolar moments, and they are expected to exhibit exotic physical properties. Through an investigation using resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy (RIXS), Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical ligand-field (LF) multiplet and $ab initio$ calculations, we fully characterized the local electronic structure of Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$, particularly, the crystal-field symmetry of the 5$d^2$ electrons in this anomalous material. The low-energy multiplet excitations from RIXS at the oxygen $K$ edge and Raman-active phonons both show no splitting. These findings are consistent with the ground state of Os ions dominated by magnetic octupoles. Obtained parameters pave the way for further realistic microscopic studies of this highly unusual class of materials, advancing our understanding of spin-orbit physics in systems with higher-order multipoles.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor, the pressurized $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$, we present a renormalized mean-field theory of a bilayer single-band $t$-$J$ model, highlighting the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang</p>
            <p>Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cram√©r-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Although single layers of CrS$_2$ were predicted to be stable by density functional theory calculations and reported in previous experimental studies, we were unable to synthesize CrS$_2$ under our range of experimental conditions.</p>

            <p>Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.</p>

            <p>A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials could, in principle, be coupled with other materials to produce a more robust superconducting state. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</p>

This manifests in distinct quasi-momentum distributions and energy spectra for bosons and spin-1/2 fermions, despite their fermionization. Furthermore, trapped fermions in higher branches exhibit novel spin textures, intricately linked to charge excitations, necessitating a coupled multi-chain description beyond single effective spin-chain models. Our findings unveil a rich interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in highly excited 1D systems, opening avenues for exploring novel quantum phenomena beyond the conventional paradigm of low-lying states.</p>

            <h2>Self-organized dynamics and emergent shape spaces of active isotropic fluid surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da Gao, Huayang Sun, Rui Ma, Alexander Mietke</p>
            <p>Theories of self-organized active fluid surfaces have emerged as an important class of minimal models for the shape dynamics of biological membranes, cells and tissues. However, due to their inherent geometric nonlinearities and the absence of general minimization principles in active systems, it remains a major challenge to systematically study the emergent shape spaces such theories give rise to. Here, we introduce a novel variational approach that allows for a direct computation of stationary surface geometries and flows, which enables the classification of non-equilibrium phase transitions in shape spaces described by active surface theories. To achieve this, we construct a dissipation functional systematically from the entropy production in active surfaces and show how generic symmetries imposed by Onsager relations can be exploited to also account for reactive non-dissipative terms in constitutive laws. This functional is supplemented by Lagrange multipliers that relax nonlinear geometric constraints, which leads to a tractable variational problem suitable for implicit dynamic simulations and explicit calculations of non-trivial steady state geometries and flows. We apply this framework to study the dynamics of open fluid membranes and closed active fluid surfaces, and characterize the space of stationary solutions that corresponding surfaces and flows occupy. These analyses rationalize the interplay of first-order shape transitions of internally and externally forced fluid membranes, reveal degenerate regions in stationary shape spaces of mechanochemically active surfaces and identify a mechanism by which hydrodynamic screening controls the geometry of active surfaces undergoing cell division-like shape transformations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janik Sch√ºttler, Rosalba Garcia-Millan, Michael E. Cates, Sarah A. M. Loos</p>
            <p>We revisit the elementary problem of moving a particle in a harmonic trap in finite time with minimal work cost, and extend it to the case of an active particle. By comparing the Gaussian case of an Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and the non-Gaussian run-and-tumble particle, we establish general principles for thermodynamically optimal control of active matter beyond specific models. We show that the open-loop optimal protocols, which do not incorporate system-state information, are identical to those of passive particles but result in larger work fluctuations due to activity. In contrast, closed-loop (or feedback) control with a single (initial) measurement changes the optimal protocol and reduces the average work relative to the open-loop control for small enough measurement errors. Minimum work is achieved by particles with finite persistence time. As an application, we propose an active information engine which extracts work from self-propulsion. This periodic engine achieves higher information efficiency with run-and-tumble particles than with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. Complementing a companion paper that gives only the main results [arXiv:2407.18542], here we provide a full account of our theoretical calculations and simulation results. We include derivations of optimal protocols, work variance, impact of measurement uncertainty, and information-acquisition costs.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of persistent current in a non-Hermitian disordered ring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suparna Sarkar, Soumya Satpathi, Swapan K. Pati</p>
            <p>We have studied the Aharonov-Bohm flux-induced magnetic response of a disordered non-Hermitian ring. The disorder is introduced through an on-site quasiperiodic potential described by the Aubry-Andr√©-Harper (AAH) model, incorporating a complex phase that renders the model non-Hermitian. Our findings reveal that this form of non-Hermiticity enhances the persistent current, without requiring hopping dimerization. We explore both non-interacting and interacting scenarios. In the former, we examine spinless fermions, while in the latter, we consider fermions with Hubbard interactions. The Non-Hermitian phase induces both the real and imaginary components of the current. We thoroughly analyze the energy eigenspectrum, ground state energy, and persistent current in both real and imaginary spaces for various system parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the combined effects of non-Hermiticity and disorder strength on persistent currents. We find an enhancement in both the real and imaginary components of the persistent current with increasing disorder strength, as well as the non-Hermiticity, up to a critical value. Furthermore, we observe an enhancement in persistent current in the presence of Hubbard correlation. Our findings may provide a new route to get nontrivial characteristics in persistent current for a special type of non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Pinch-line spin liquids as layered Coulomb phases and applications to cubic models</h2>

            <p>Spin liquids form fluctuating magnetic textures which have to obey certain rules imposed by frustration. These rules can often be written in the form of a Gauss law, indicating the local conservation of an emergent electric field. In reciprocal space, these emergent Gauss laws appear as singularities known as pinch points, that are accessible to neutron-scattering measurements. But more exotic forms of electromagnetism have been stabilized in spin liquids, and in a few rare instances, these zero-dimensional singularities have been extended into one-dimensional pinch lines. Here we propose a simple framework for the design of pinch-line spin liquids in a layered structure of two-dimensional algebraic spin liquids. A plethora of models can be build within this framework, as exemplified by several concrete examples where our theory is confirmed by simulations, and where the rank of the tensorial gauge field is continuously varied along the pinch line, opening new avenues in fractonic matter. Then we use our framework to understand how the evolution of the singularity pinch point along the pinch line can be understood as the interference pattern of two emergent electric fields. Finally, we apply our intuition on these emergent electric fields in real space to generic pinch line models beyond our layered framework, and revisit the recently proposed pinch line model on the octochlore lattice.</p>

            <h2>Relativistic Spin-Lattice Interaction Compatible with Discrete Translation Symmetry in Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bumseop Kim, Noejung Park, Kyoung-Whan Kim</p>
            <p>Recent interest in orbital angular momentum has led to a rapid expansion of research on spin-orbit coupling effects in solids, while also highlighting significant technical challenges. The breaking of rotational symmetry renders the orbital angular momentum operator ill-defined, causing conceptual and computational issues in describing orbital motion. To address these issues, here we propose an alternative framework. Based on the Bloch representation of the full relativistic interaction, we derive a field that directly couples to electron spins while preserving discrete translational symmetry, thereby eliminating the need for the position operator. Our approach is fully compatible with existing first-principles computational frameworks for both static and time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that this method offers a more effective description of the Edelstein and spin Hall effects compared to conventional orbital angular momentum formalisms.</p>

            <h2>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Su</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. These lattice models flow to the $c =1$ compact boson conformal field theory, with a twist that depends on the lattice size modulo four. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tuo, ZeZhu Zeng, Jiale Chen, Bingqing Cheng</p>
            <p>Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann generator built on discrete flow matching, specifically tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or crystalline compounds). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead. In addition, the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. This framework provides a scalable and computationally efficient solution for discrete coordinate systems and can be extended to sample the alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline compounds.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoconductivity due to electron-electron interaction in a non-Galilean-invariant Fermi liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatia Kiliptari, Dmitrii L. Maslov</p>
            <p>The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a classic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp scattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur. In this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such as dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected Fermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a two-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first non-zero contribution scales as $T^4\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this paper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from electron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the $T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal components of the magnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\ln T$, respectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling, i.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered for a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum, magnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron interactions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when electron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that all the components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values that are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the corresponding values at $T=0$.</p>

            <p>We discuss the limit cycle regime of a finite-time quantum Otto cycle with a frictionless two-dimensional anisotropic Ising model as the working fluid. From Onsagers exact equilibrium solution, we first find optimal parameters for the operational modes of work extraction and cooling for infinitely slow cycles. The equilibrium points in these optimal cycles correspond to different phases of the model, such that the non-equilibrium dynamics during the cycle bypasses the phase transition. Finite-time cycles allow for finite power extraction or cooling currents, but for such cycles we point out that -- already within the regime of weak system-reservoir coupling -- energetic changes of the system during dissipative strokes may contain a significant portion of coupling and decoupling control work and should thus not be directly identified with heat. For ultrafast cycles, the required control work spoils performance, such that to maximize work extraction or cooling heat per cycle time, there is an optimal cycle duration. We also find that net zero-energy transitions may lead to undesired reservoir heating.</p>

            <p>Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</p>

            <h2>Many-body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Wu, Saumya Shivam, Amos Chan</p>
            <p>We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

            <p>Previously, it was believed that conduction and valence bands exhibit a symmetry: They possess opposite topological invariants (e.g., the Chern numbers of conduction and valence bands for the Chern insulator are $\pm C$). However, we present a counterexample: The second Stiefel-Whitney numbers for conduction and valence bands over the Klein bottle may be asymmetric, with one being nontrivial while the other trivial. Here, the Stiefel-Whitney classes are the characteristic classes for real Bloch functions under $PT$ symmetry with $(PT)^2=1$, and the Klein bottle is the momentum-space unit under the projective anticommutation relation of the mirror reflection reversing $x$ and the translation along the $y$ direction. The asymmetry originates from the algebraic difference of real cohomology classes over the Klein bottle and torus. This discovery is rooted in the foundation of topological band theory, and has the potential to fundamentally refresh our current understanding of topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Size-Dependent Power Laws for Edge Dislocations in Nickel Superalloys: A Molecular Dynamics Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Divyeshkumar A. Mistry, Amuthan A. Ramabathiran</p>
            <p>We present computational evidence using MD simulations of a size effect for the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of edge dislocation motion in nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic $\gamma'$ precipitates inside a uniform $\gamma$ matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the $\gamma$ phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the $\gamma'$ precipitate for temperatures in the range 300 K to 700 K. The CRSS is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the $\gamma'$ precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the CRSS on the length of the $\gamma'$ precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure $\gamma'$ system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. We present auxillary results using spherical precipitates that exhibit the same trend, but a full analysis of the interplay between size of the precipitate, volume fraction, and other related factors is not pursued in this work. Despite the special configurations considered in this work, the results presented here highlights non-trivial size-dependent effects, provides new details on the strengthening effect of $\gamma'$ precipitates in nickel superalloys, and has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.</p>

            <h2>Quantum anomalous Hall effects and emergent $\rm{SU}(2)$ Hall ferromagnets at fractional filling of helical trilayer graphene</h2>

            <p>Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moir√© system for exploring correlated topological states emerging from high Chern bands. Motivated by recent experimental observations of anomalous Hall effects at fractional fillings of magic-angle helical trilayers, we focus on the higher Chern number $|C_{band}|=2$ band and explore gapped many-body Hall states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. Through extensive exact diagonalization, we predict novel phases unattainable in a single $|C_{band}|=1$ band. At filling $\nu=2/3$ and $\nu=1/3$, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ charge-ordered quantum Hall crystal and a Halperin fractional Chern insulator with Hall conductance $|\sigma_{H}|=2e^2/3h$ are predicted respectively, indicating strong particle-hole asymmetry of the system. At half-filling $\nu=1/2$, an extensively degenerate pseudospin Hall ferromagnet featuring emergent $\rm{SU}(2)$ symmetry is found without the band being flat. Inspired by striking robustness of the ferromagnetic degeneracy, we develop a method to unveil and quantify the emergent symmetry via pseudospin operator construction in the presence of band dispersion and Coulomb interaction, and demonstrate persistence of the $\rm{SU}(2)$ quantum numbers even far away from the chiral limit. Incorporating spin-valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime $\nu_{\rm{total}}=3+\nu$ for realizing the above states. Notably, inter-flavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic sublattice corrugation parameter regimes.</p>

            <p>High-throughput analysis of multidimensional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) datasets remains a significant challenge, limiting the broader impact on strategic materials research. Conventional workflows typically involve sequential, modular processing steps that necessitate extensive manual intervention and offline parameter tuning. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end post-processing framework for large-scale four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) datasets, built around a highly efficient neural network-based object detection model. Central to our method is a sub-pixel accurate object center localization algorithm, which serves as the foundation for high-precision and high-throughput analysis of electron diffraction patterns. We demonstrate a strain measurement precision of 5x$10^{-4}$, quantified by the standard deviation of strain values within the strain-free Si substrate of a Si/SiGe multilayer TEM sample. Furthermore, by implementing an asynchronous, non-blocking object detection workflow, we achieve speeds exceeding 100 frames per second (fps), substantially accelerating the crystallographic phase identification and strain mapping in complex multiphase metallic alloys.</p>

            <p>We present a high-fidelity three dimensional computational framework for simulating the bulk mechanical behavior of granular aggregates composed of deformable brittle grains. Departing from classical discrete element methods (DEM), our approach captures both inter-particle and intra-particle deformation using a nonlocal continuum formulation based on peridynamics. Each grain is individually meshed from level-set representations, enabling accurate modeling of elastic response and autonomous fracture evolution without requiring explicit crack tracking or fragment reconstruction. We validate the method through benchmark simulations, including the Kalthoff-Winkler fracture test, crushing of hollow spheres, and compound impact-crushing scenarios. The framework is further applied to large aggregates of up to 1000 sand grains of irregular shapes reconstructed from three dimensional X-ray computed tomography. Simulations reveal convergence of bulk stress response under compression, suggesting the feasibility of constructing representative volume elements (RVEs) for multiscale modeling. Finally, we investigate the role of grain geometry and topology on the macroscopic strength of the aggregate, providing insight into microstructure-driven failure mechanisms. The framework exhibits excellent strong and weak scaling behavior, with simulations executed on up to 1600 cores, demonstrating its suitability for high-performance computing environments and large-scale modeling.</p>

            <p>We use the quantum metric to understand the properties of quasicrystals, represented by the one-dimensional (1D) Fibonacci chain. We show that the quantum metric can relate the localization properties of the eigenstates to the scale-invariance of both the chain and its energy spectrum. In particular, the quantum metric incorporates information about distances between the local symmetry centers of each eigenstate, making it much more sensitive to the localization properties of quasicrystals than other measures of localization, such as the inverse participation ratio. We further find that a full description of localization requires us to introduce a new phasonic component to the quantum metric, and a mixed phason-position Chern number. Finally, we show that the sum of both position and phasonic components of the quantum metric is lower-bounded by the gap labels associated with each energy gap of the Fibonacci chain. This establishes a direct link between the spatial localization and fractal energy spectrum of quasicrystals. Taken together, the quantum metric provides a unifying, yet accessible, understanding of quasicrystals, rooted in their scale-invariance and with intriguing consequences also for many-body physics.</p>

            <p>Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature for underdamped Langevin equation. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations, specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested on a benchmark case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized Langevin equation inference to activated phenomena, such as chemical reactions, in several scientific domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Hao Bian, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate how static symmetry-breaking perturbations and dynamic Floquet terms via a polarized light manipulate the topological phase transitions in the two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing-point (QBCP) materials. The Berry curvature shows distinct behavior in such two situations. It is linearly and quadratically proportional to the product of microstructural parameters $t_{x,z}$ for the former and the latter, respectively. The static perturbation eliminates the QBCP and opens an energy gap, which leads to the momentum-inversion symmetry of Berry curvature. This yields a nontrivial Chern number determined by the microstructural parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that either a circularly or an elliptically polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, transforming the QBCP semimetal into a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = Ce^2/\hbar$, where the Chern number is governed by the polarization angle. Moreover, the linear polarization preserves the central antisymmetry of the Berry curvature, giving rise to a topological trivial insulator. These results establish a tunable topological phase transition from a QBCP semimetal to Chern insulator in the two-dimensional QBCP materials.</p>

            <p>The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.</p>

            <p>We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charith L. Hirimuthugodage, Laalitha S.I. Liyanage, K. G. S. H. Gunawardana</p>
            <p>This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.</p>

            <h2>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory for the pseudogap and the transition to $d$-wave superconductivity in the cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Pandey, Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).</p>

            <h2>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg Evnin</p>
            <p>The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</p>

            <h2>Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle Kawagoe, Wilbur Shirley</p>
            <p>We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang</p>
            <p>Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</p>

            <p>We present the design, implementation, and validation of a cryo-compatible strain cell for elastoresistance measurements in quantum materials. The cell is actuated by three large-format piezoelectric stacks and enables both compressive and tensile strain up to approximately $\pm5\%$. The relative displacement of the sample holders is measured in situ using a high-resolution capacitive displacement sensor, ensuring precise strain control throughout measurement. To operate the strain cell over a broad temperature range from 4.2\,K to 300\,K, a modular measurement probe was developed, allowing efficient thermal coupling and integration into cryogenic environments. The functionality and precision of the setup were demonstrated by elastoresistance measurements on the iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$As$_2$ along the [110] direction. The results were validated against conventional techniques based on glued samples and strain gauges, showing excellent agreement in amplitude and temperature dependence of the elastoresistance coefficient. Additional tests revealed that the system remains robust under mechanical vibrations introduced by vacuum pumps, enabling stable operation even with liquid nitrogen cooling. This highlights the high mechanical and thermal reliability of the developed platform for low-temperature transport measurements under controlled uniaxial strain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabio Saracco, Giovanni Petri, Renaud Lambiotte, Tiziano Squartini</p>
            <p>Network theory has often disregarded many-body relationships, solely focusing on pairwise interactions: neglecting them, however, can lead to misleading representations of complex systems. Hypergraphs represent a suitable framework for describing polyadic interactions. Here, we leverage the representation of hypergraphs based on the incidence matrix for extending the entropy-based approach to higher-order structures: in analogy with the Exponential Random Graphs, we introduce the Exponential Random Hypergraphs (ERHs). After exploring the asymptotic behaviour of thresholds generalising the percolation one, we apply ERHs to study real-world data. First, we generalise key network metrics to hypergraphs; then, we compute their expected value and compare it with the empirical one, in order to detect deviations from random behaviours. Our method is analytically tractable, scalable and capable of revealing structural patterns of real-world hypergraphs that differ significantly from those emerging as a consequence of simpler constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye-jun Xu, Long-hua Zhai, Peng Fu, Shou-jing Cheng, Guo-Qiang Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a cavity magnonic system driven by a parametric field, where an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed in a spinning microwave resonator. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram due to both magnon Kerr nonlinearity in YIG and parametric drive on the resonator. Especially, Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and first-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, we show that the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the cavity is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Wold, Pedro Ribeiro, Sergey Denisov</p>
            <p>Random unitaries are an important resource for quantum information processing. While their universal properties have been thoroughly analyzed, it is not known what happens to these properties when the unitaries are sampled on the present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We implement parameterized circuits, which have been proposed as a means to generate random unitaries, on an IBM Quantum processor and model these implementations as quantum maps. To retrieve the maps, a machine-learning assisted tomography is used. We find the spectrum of a map to be either an annulus or a disk depending on the circuit depth and detect an annulus-disk transition. By their spectral properties, the retrieved maps appear to be very similar to a recently introduced ensemble of random maps, for which spectral densities can be analytically evaluated. Our results establish, via Dissipative Quantum Chaos theory, a connection between intrinsic properties of present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing platforms and non-Hermitian random matrix theory.</p>

            <p>In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent non-locality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. Particularly, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) within the neural quantum tomography of the highly-entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of the N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with non-local patterns and pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edoardo Ballini, Julius Mildenberger, Matteo M. Wauters, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. We use macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We illustrate our findings by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror and an isotropic chiral medium. We find different asymptotic power laws for all these materials. Interestingly, we find two bridges between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift that arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Namely, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depend on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, the Casimir-Polder depending on the velocities for the chiral case have the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response while those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.</p>

            <h2>The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huai-Chin Huang, Shih-Min Chen, Claude Weisbuch, James S. Speck, Yuh-Renn Wu</p>
            <p>Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V < \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.</p>

            <p>We explore the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement entropy in systems evolved by quantum measurements and spatially homogeneous unitary gates. In models with temporally random and Floquet unitary gates, we find that the Lyapunov exponents typically converge to values independent of measurement outcomes and that spectral transitions of the Lyapunov spectrum and entanglement transitions of ground states occur at the same measurement thresholds. Our results indicate that (i) randomness due to quantum measurements is enough, or equivalently, randomness of unitary gates is not essential, for the typical convergence of the Lyapunov spectrum and that (ii) the correspondence between the spectral transition and entanglement transition is ubiquitous in a wide range of systems. We also discuss why the typical convergence occurs, in light of the uniqueness and positive definiteness of stationary states in the completely-positive trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamics averaged over random measurement outcomes.</p>

            <h2>A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierfrancesco Di Cintio, Bruno Marcos</p>
            <p>Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.</p>

            <p>The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model provides an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit, all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Intended as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity, woven throughout this work, underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</p>

            <p>We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression dynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two particle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the non-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are observed for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and pressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by considering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between particles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed during compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering, bars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force chains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises continuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip motion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with inter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the reduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable features in designing magnetic granular dampers.</p>

            <h2>Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton spectroscopy.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Ata√ß ƒ∞mamoƒülu, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</p>

            <p>Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Counterflow leads to roton spectra in locally interacting superfluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Alperin, Eddy Timmermans</p>
            <p>The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled nonlinear-Schr√∂dinger equations.</p>

            <p>Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Zeng</p>
            <p>We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the $p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$.

            <h2>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Flat Bands with Paramagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yedi Shen, Sanyi You, Zhenhua Qiao, Qian Niu</p>
            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites. The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$, and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results. Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and quantum geometry.</p>

            <h2>Perfect Superconducting Diode and Supercurrent Range Controller</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>Diodes have a nonreciprocal voltage versus current relationship, produced by breaking the space and time reversal symmetry. However, developing high-end superconducting computers requires a superconducting analogue of the traditional semiconductor diode. Such a superconducting diode exhibits non-reciprocity, or a high asymmetry in its critical currents. We present a model of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum interference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires (MW-SQUID). The superconducting condensate in the nanowires is assumed to obey a linear current-phase relationship (CPR). The diode predicted by our model has a large positive critical current, while the negative critical current can be made exactly zero. Thus achieved 100\% diode efficiency ($\eta = 1$) remains stable against small changes of the magnetic field. Another important result is that under certain and quite broad conditions such devices can act as supercurrent range controllers. In such device a supercurrent can flow with zero voltage applied, but only if the supercurrent is contained in some narrow, adjustable range, which excludes zero current.</p>

            <p>We considered a planar Josephson junction which is composed of two s-wave superconducting contacts deposited on the top of a thin antiferromagnetic (AFM) disordered metal film. In such a system noticeable Josephson currents may be observed, if contacts are just nanometers away from each other. It is shown that the excitation of AFM by magnons results in a strong enhancement of the stationary current through much longer junctions, whose length may be comparable to the coherence length of superconducting correlations in a nonmagnetic metal. Such a current is calculated at the weak tunneling amplitude of electrons between superconducting contacts and AFM. The problem is considered for nonequilibrium Green functions in the second-order perturbation theory with respect to the electron-magnon interaction. A spin-orbit torque oscillator was taken as a possible source of long-wavelength classic magnetic waves. This work predicts a strong effect of magnons on superconducting proximity effect in AFM, with promising applications in superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Altermagnetism in Antiferromagnetic 2D Films via Adsorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Liu, Sike Zeng, Ji-Hai Liao, Yu-Jun Zhao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify 63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3 selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.</p>

            <p>In a recent experiment (Hou et al Phys. Rev. X 15, 011027), a new type of necklace-like vortex bound state (VBS) was observed and attributed to disorder induced interference among different Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states within one single vortex. In this work, we further investigate the possibilities of quantum interference among the CdGM states from different vortices in clean superconductors, which may become significant near the upper critical field. We find a series of interference patterns in the local density of states (LDOS) due to the overlap between spatially separated individual CdGM states. On a vortex lattice, the interference can also lead to a necklace-like LDOS, hence, providing an alternative and intrinsic mechanism to observe the novel necklace-like, or other spatially modulated VBS more generally, in experiments. These results can be understood quite well within an effective tight-binding model constructed from the individual CdGM states, and can be checked in future experiments.</p>

            <p>Bi-doped copper (Cu1-xBix) nanowires (NWs), promising candidates for spintronic applications due to their potential for a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), were synthesized and their structural properties and thermal stability were investigated. Using template-assisted electrodeposition, Cu1-xBix nanowires with varying bismuth (Bi) content (x=0, 2, 4, and 7%) and different crystalline domain sizes were fabricated. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in the grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. While NWs with larger crystalline domains allow homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, NWs with smaller crystalline domains exhibit noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability of the NWs was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering. Upon heating, lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice were observed, with subsequent crystallization of rhombohedral metallic Bi upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the SHE performance of Cu1-xBix nanowires for spintronic devices by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.</p>

            <p>Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the visible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use is limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally evaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a simple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the chemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal co-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents ranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite structure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that low Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin films (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to oxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic wetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass. Among the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest chemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and excellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas that exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach provides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic device applications.</p>

Sensitivity analyses indicate that small variations in elastic modulus and contact pressure can significantly influence leakage, particularly near the percolation threshold.

A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays. Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions, emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered phase.</p>

This study specifically investigates the effect of surface roughness on the adhesion behavior of the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), focusing on a complementary interface with identical roughness. To create surface roughness, sandpapers with grit sizes ranging from N = 120 to N = 2000 were used during the molding process. The surface roughness of the PDMS elastomer was then characterized using a stylus profilometer. Interfacial adhesion was evaluated through wedge test experiments, which enabled the analysis of the relationship between surface roughness, work of adhesion, and equilibrium crack length.

            <p>Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.</p>

Using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), we uncover a new spiral state confined to the surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the $\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface.

Here, we report a bottom-up pathway to synthesize bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (BFH) with periodic composition fluctuation (8 nm in wavelength) using elemental partitioning by cation diffusion, providing opportunities to exploit novel characteristics of hetero-epitaxial oxide thin films in bulk materials. Exemplar monolithic BiFeO3-BaTiO3 BFH ceramics described herein share common features with their thin film heterostructure counterparts, which facilitates control and stabilisation of ferroelectric polarisation along with a significant enhancement in Curie temperature, Tc, and functionality. BFH ceramics exhibit a record Tc (up to 824 ¬∞C) and a piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 115 pC N-1 ), in comparison with other perovskite or non-perovskite solid solutions, providing sustainable solutions for emergent high temperature piezoelectric sensing, actuation and energy conversion applications. By creating BFH ceramics using different electromechanical boundary conditions, distinct morphologies of aliovalent A-site cation segregated regions along with different types of ferroelectric order are achieved. This formation mechanism provides unprecedented control over local ferroelectric ordering and domain stabilisation in BFH ceramics; it also paves the way to explore new types of functionality, beyond those achievable in both bulk ferroelectrics and thin film heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1D XXZ Spin Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beau Leighton-Trudel</p>
            <p>The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest. Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.</p>

            <h2>Distinct Uniaxial Stress and Pressure Fingerprint of Superconductivity in the 3D Kagome Lattice Compound CeRu2</h2>

            <p>The exploration of tunable superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems is a central pursuit in condensed matter physics, with implications for both fundamental understanding and potential applications. The Laves phase CeRu$_{2}$, a pyrochlore compound, exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) Kagome lattice type geometry giving rise to flat bands and degenerate Dirac points, where band structure features intertwine with strong multi-orbital interaction effects deriving from its correlated electronic structure. Here, we combine muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), uniaxial in-plane stress, and hydrostatic pressure to probe the superconducting state of CeRu$_{2}$. Uniaxial stress up to 0.22 GPa induces a dome-shaped evolution of the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, with an initial plateau, successively followed by enhancement and suppression without any structural phase transition. Stress is further found to drive a crossover from anisotropic to isotropic $s$-wave pairing. In contrast, hydrostatic pressure up to 2.2 GPa leaves $T_{\rm c}$ largely unchanged but alters the superfluid density from exponential to linear behavior at low temperatures, indicative of nodal superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure. Taken together, these results indicate that CeRu$_{2}$ occupies an ideal position in parameter space, enabling highly responsive and multifold tunability of superconductivity in this three-dimensional correlated electronic system. This warrants further quantitative analysis of the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic correlations, and pairing symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Chakraborty, Pooja Sudha, Hemant Arora, Daniel Moraru, Arup Samanta</p>
            <p>Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states, observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Learning a potential formulation for rate-and-state friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengduo Liu, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Nadia Lapusta</p>
            <p>Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.</p>

            <h2>From Spheres to Cones: Structural Instabilities and Acidity at Conical Regions in Trivalent Metal Ion Nano-clusters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihong Shi, Han Nguyen, Mateo Pescador Arboleda, Styliani Consta</p>
            <p>Sub-nanometer aqueous clusters containing a single trivalent metal cation can exhibit charge-induced structural instabilities. Here, we present computational evidence that clusters containing a single \ce{Fe^{3+}}, \ce{Lu^{3+}}, or \ce{La^{3+}} ion undergo continuous geometric transformations as a consequence of this instability. These clusters dynamically evolve across their potential energy landscape, adopting triangular, elongated two-point, single-point, and more spherical configurations often with distinct conical surface protrusions. The manifestation of this instability differs from that observed in mesoscopic and microscopic droplets containing macroions, where stable ``star-like'' structures form, characterized by a specific number of conical protrusions that varies with the droplet size. In the present study, we find that the orientation of the \ce{H2O} molecules surrounding the metal ion is influenced not only by the electric field of the trivalent ion but also by the local conical protrusions. To further investigate the local acidity in the conical protrusions, we employ a proxy model system consisting of an aqueous nano-cluster containing three \ce{H3O+} ions, simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics. Within the conical regions of the cluster, protons exhibit diffusion across several water molecules, in contrast to the more localized proton delocalization observed in the compact body of the cluster. These findings suggest that local geometry can significantly modulate acidity in highly charged nano-clusters, with potential implications for understanding charge-transfer and ionization mechanisms in techniques such as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and complement interpretations from infrared spectroscopic data.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Mia Kyler, Ishaan U. Patel</p>
            <p>Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic adsorption potential of superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiu Hui Wu, Jiamin Niu, Kejiang Zhou</p>
            <p>Based on the general thermodynamic analysis of Polanyi adsorption potential, the adsorption potential condition for superconductors is obtained exactly by using the quantum state equation we presented. Because this adsorption potential results in changes of electron concentration, temperature and pressure in a certain volume (adsorption space) adjacent to the surface of the lattice, the composition and structure of superconductors are of course decisive for the adsorption potential. Then we calculate the molar adsorption potentials for those typical superconductors, and find that it is positively correlated to the superconductivity temperature , which reveals that those high-superconductors are mainly determined by the higher molar adsorption potentials. In addition, the adsorption potential at still works despite the disappearance of the energy gap of the BCS theory. This shows that beyond the electron-phonon interaction mechanism, the Cooper-paired electrons are mainly formed by this physical adsorption potential for high-superconductors. This adsorption potential theory could explain almost all common facts about high-temperature superconductors, including many anomalies of the normal and superconducting states.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.</p>

            <p>The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure, and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced $\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$ hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.</p>

            <h2>The electronic and transport properties in the Haldane-Hubbard with odd-parity altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minghuan Zeng, Zheng Qin, Ling Qin, Shiping Feng, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang</p>
            <p>The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.</p>

            <p>The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics. Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern number C > 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1 and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v = 5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition, we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C > 1) that develops continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of the fractional phases with C < 1.</p>

            <h2>An analytical model for the remote epitaxial potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason K Kawasaki, Quinn T Campbell</p>
            <p>We propose an analytical model for the remote bonding potential of the substrate that permeates through graphene during remote epitaxy. Our model, based on a Morse interatomic potential, includes the attenuation due to (1) the increased separation between film and substrate and (2) free carrier screening from graphene. Compared with previous slab density functional theory calculations, which use the electrostatic potential as a proxy for bonding, our analytical model provides a more direct description of bonding, explicitly includes screening (which is often ignored), and is based on simple, interpretable, and well benchmarked parameters. We show that the magnitude of $|\phi_{remote}|$ for typical semiconductor and oxide substrates is few meV, similar to the van der Waals potential of graphene. This suggests interference between the graphene and remote substrate potentials, plus interfacial reconstructions, must be considered when interpreting experiments on remote epitaxy. We use our model to interpret previous experiments from the remote epitaxy and related literature, highlighting connections to moire epitaxy and to the ordering of graphite intercalation compounds. Our model also points to tests, based on tunable screening and spatial extent of the substrate potential, that may increase the strength of the remote potential towards the more idealized picture.</p>

            <p>Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <p>Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiewei Ding, Jiahao Su, Ho-Kin Tang, Wing Chi Yu</p>
            <p>Continuous spin models with long-range interactions of the form $r^{-\sigma}$, where $r$ is the distance between two spins and $\sigma$ controls the decay of the interaction, exhibit enhanced order that competes with thermal disturbances, leading to a richer variety of phases and types of phase transitions. In-depth research in this area not only aids in comprehending the complex behaviors in theoretical models but also provides valuable insights into the diverse phase transitions observed in real materials. Here, we identify that the true long-range ordered phase encompasses distinct scaling regimes, which we term Enhance Long-Range Ordered (EnLRO) and Reduce Long-Range Ordered (ReLRO) regimes. In the one-dimensional XY model, the crossover from EnLRO to ReLRO regimes occurs around $\sigma \approx 1.575$, while in two dimensions, the crossover happens near $\sigma \approx 3.2$. Applying finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents that characterize the order-to-disorder phase transitions in the EnLRO and ReLRO regimes, constructing comprehensive phase diagrams. The analysis is further extended to the 1D and 2D long-range Heisenberg models, where we find the EnLRO-ReLRO crossover at $\sigma \approx 1.575$ and $\sigma \approx 3.22$, respectively. The similar crossover points suggest that the distinction between EnLRO and ReLRO regimes is a generic feature in continuous spin models with long-range interactions.</p>

            <p>We present a thorough symmetry-based classification of superconducting order parameters that is independent of their microscopic origins. Our approach involves classifying pairing states through the pairwise permutation of spatial, temporal, spin, and orbital indices, focusing on the parities of the relative coordinates and times of the paired fields. This framework leads to the emergence of new classes of superconducting states, which we visualize as a multidimensional cube representing the relative parities in space and time, referred to as the Berezinskii-Abrahams hypercube. While some predicted states, such as odd-frequency superconductors, have been previously discussed, our symmetry analysis also reveals states that have yet to be explored, including odd-frequency Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states. Furthermore, we draw parallels to the classification of particle-hole states, and reiterate the possibility of new states, such as odd-frequency density waves.</p>

A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy release of ~Rln2. Resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction of characteristic Bragg peaks indicates a significant presence of disorder, potentially related to random tilts and rotations of rigid ReO6 octahedra.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in $\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and 0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions. Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100 nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm) and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively. Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access memory.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the Self-Orthogonality at Exceptional Points in Driven $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetric Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Fritzsche, Riccardo Sorbello, Ronny Thomale, Alexander Szameit</p>
            <p>We explore the effect of self-orthogonality at exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian Parity-Time-symmetric systems. Using a driven three-band lattice model, we show that the Rabi frequency diverges as the system approaches an EP due to the coalescence of eigenstates. We demonstrate that this divergence manifests in experimentally accessible power oscillations, establishing a direct observable for self-orthogonality. Our results provide a pathway for probing EP physics in various metamaterial platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Annealing Enhanced Machine Learning for Interpretable Phase Classification of High-Entropy Alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Ibarra Hoyos, Gia-Wei Chern, Israel Klich, Joseph Poon</p>
            <p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves, Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step toward practical quantum acceleration in materials discovery pipelines.</p>

            <h2>Rigid-Body Anisotropy in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Liu, Yang Gao, Qian Niu</p>
            <p>Characterizing the anisotropic structure in noncollinear antiferromagnets is essential for antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we provide a microscopic theory linking the anisotropy effects induced by the rigid-body rotation of spin order to spin-orbit coupling. Our method goes beyond the conventional magnetic group theory, offering a concise yet powerful tool to characterize diverse anisotropy effects in complex magnetic systems. Using the group representation theory of the spin group, we obtain a set of basis functions formed from tensor elements of spin-orbit vector--which originates from spin-orbit coupling and is tied to the rigid-body rotation of the spin order--to systematically describe the structure of anisotropy effects. As a concrete example, we apply our framework to coplanar antiferromagnets Mn$_3$Sn and Mn$_3$Ir, demonstrating that the corresponding basis functions can well capture both the geometric and magnitude dependencies of the magnetic anisotropy energy and anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our framework to broader classes of anisotropy phenomena in magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Electric-Field Induced Spin Wave Nonreciprocity in Noncoplanar Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Hui Li, Yuan-Ming Lu, Yuan Wan</p>
            <p>We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully consistent with the symmetry analysis.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) is a powerful technique providing for crystal structure solutions of sub-micron sized crystals too small for structure determination via X-ray techniques. The entry requirement, however, of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) adapted with bespoke software for coordinated sample stage rotation and continuous electron diffraction data acquisition has generally inhibited the wider uptake of 3DED. To address this limitation, we present novel software GiveMeED appropriate for controlled 3DED data acquisition. The collection of useable reflections beyond 0.8 √Ö makes 3DED crystallographic processing effectively routine, using standard software and workflows derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) techniques. A full experimental workflow for 3DED on a conventional TEM is described in practical terms, in combination with direct imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for the return of comprehensive correlative descriptions of crystal morphologies and sample compositions, with due regard for the quantification of electron flux at each stage of the characterisation process. The accuracy and effectiveness of GiveMeED is demonstrated through structure solutions for case study paracetamol, copper(II) phthalocyanine, and percholorocoronene samples, characterised in their near-native states under controlled low dose conditions at either room or cryogenic temperatures, with determined unit cell parameters and atomic connectivity matching accepted literature X-ray structures for these compounds. To promote the wider adoption of 3DED, we make GiveMeED freely available for use and modification, in support of greater uptake and utilisation of structure solution procedures via electron diffraction.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation induced Majarona $0$- and $œÄ$-modes in a driven Rashba nanowire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustabh Gogoi, Tanay Nag, Arnob Kumar Ghosh</p>
            <p>Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and $\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes (TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.</p>

            <p>Dislocations in oxides with ionic/covalent bonding hold the potential of harnessing versatile functionalities. Here, high-density dislocations in a large plastic zone in potassium niobate (KNbO3) crystals are mechanically introduced by room-temperature cyclic scratching to enhance piezocatalytic hydrogen production. Unlike conventional energy-intensive, time-consuming deformation at high temperature, this approach merits efficient dislocation engineering. These dislocations induce local strain and modify the electronic environment, thereby improving surface reactivity and charge separation, which are critical for piezocatalysis. This proof-of-concept offers a practical and sustainable alternative for functionalizing piezoelectric ceramics. Our findings demonstrate that surface-engineered dislocations can effectively improve the piezocatalysis, paving the way for efficient and scalable piezocatalytic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristine V. Ung, Connor A. Roncaioli, Ronald L. Walsworth, Sean M. Blakley</p>
            <p>The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

            <h2>Electro-optic Kerr Effect Induced by Nonlinear Transport in monolayer WTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He-Lin Li, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) can induce optical anisotropy by modifying a material's dielectric tensor, presenting opportunities for novel characterization and device applications. While the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) probes the linear Hall effect (LHE) in magnetic materials, an analogous optical probe for NLHE in non-magnetic, time-reversal symmetric systems remains highly desirable. Here, we theoretically propose and investigate an NLHE-induced Electro-optic Kerr Effect (EOKE) as such a probe. Focusing on monolayer (ML) WTe$_2$, a prototypical NLHE material, our analysis considers contributions from Berry curvature dipole (BCD), Drude, injection, and shift mechanisms. We demonstrate that the EOKE signal in WTe$_2$ is predominantly governed by the BCD. Furthermore, the Kerr angle exhibits temporal oscillations at different optical frequencies, suggesting EOKE as a promising route for the time-resolved detection of NLHE and the dynamic investigation of material topology.</p>

            <p>It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Sanino, I. D'Amico, V. V. Fran√ßa, I. M. Carvalho</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations, we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations, occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal correlations.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongbin Qu, Guang-Ming Zhang, Gang Li</p>
            <p>The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate, particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that, unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to half-filling.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and duration on the dynamics.</p>

            <p>The search for novel one-dimensional (1D) materials with exotic physical properties is crucial for advancing nanoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we perform a comprehensive high-throughput, first-principles study to explore the vast landscape of 1D transition-metal chalcogenides and halides. Starting with 6,832 candidate structures derived from 28 metals and 8 non-metals, we systematically evaluated their thermodynamic stability by comparing the formation energies of 1D chains against competing 2D phases, mimicking thermodynamic selectivity during nucleation. This screening identified 210 stable 1D magnetic chains. Furthermore, representation learning models revealed that chemical stoichiometry and the electron affinity of the non-metal element are key factors governing 1D stability. The stable materials exhibit a rich spectrum of properties, including diverse magnetic orders (FM, AFM) and Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in MnTe. We discovered 20 ferroelastic chains, with FeTe showing a giant magnetostriction of -5.57%. Other emergent phenomena include Charge Density Wave (CDW) chains in FeTe and NiSe. Finally, our findings propose concrete platforms for quantum applications, such as the predicted realization of Majorana zero modes in a ferromagnetic CrCl2 chain on a superconducting NbSe2 substrate.</p>

In this numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the nickelate system has stimulated enormous interest in the community of condensed matter physics. Recently, superconductivity with an onset transition temperature (Tc^onset) over 40 K was achieved in La3Ni2O7 and (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure due to in-plane compressive strain. This observation has sparked enormous attention because measurements on superconducting properties can be accessible with many commonly used experimental tools. On the other hand, the Tc in these thin films is much lower than that of the bulk bilayer nickelates under pressure. Here we report the enhancement of Tc^onset to over 60 K by applying hydrostatic pressure on the compressively strained superconducting bilayer nickelate thin films. The Tc^onset firstly ramps up with pressure, then it slightly drops down after reaching the maximum Tc^onset at about 61.5 K under a pressure of 9 GPa, showing a dome-like phase diagram. Hall effect measurements reveal that the dominant charge carriers are hole-like with a slight enhancement of charge carrier density with pressure in accompanying with the increase of Tc. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the enhancement of Tc arises from a cooperative amplification of magnetic fluctuations within and between the layers and increased metallicity under pressure. However, this enhancement exhibits saturation at higher pressures. These findings highlight the critical role of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer electronic correlations in bilayer nickelate superconductors and point to the potential of tuning Tc through controlled manipulation of the electronic structure and interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saptarshi Majumdar, Aleksandra Petkoviƒá</p>
            <p>The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied. We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches. We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of motion with respect to the initial one.</p>

            <p>Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</p>

In the benchmark compound Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O and related systems, we unambiguously resolve a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion at the Cu sites, more pronounced in the absence of Ni2+ and Mg2+, suggesting that these ions promote positional order, whereas Cu2+ ions act to destabilize it. Moreover, we detect magnetic excitations and estimate the strength of the interactions between pairs of different magnetic elements. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of the various chemical species in shaping the physical properties of high-entropy oxides.</p>

            <h2>Graphene Design with Parallel Cracks: Abnormal Crack Coalescence and Its Impact on Mechanical Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suyeong Jin, Jung-Wuk Hong, Chiara Daraio, Alexandre F. Fonseca</p>
            <p>Graphene is a material with potential applications in electric, thermal, and mechanical fields, and has seen significant advancements in growth methods that facilitate large-scale production. However, defects during growth and transfer to other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene. Surprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can enhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further research is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure and affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we investigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on the mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The behavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by distances ($W_\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings reveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two existing crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks, $W_\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As $W_\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak stress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress intensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with increasing $W_\text{gap}$. Furthermore, an increase in $W_\text{gap}$ induces a transition in fracture behavior from crack coalescence to independent propagation with intercrack undulation. This shift in fracture behavior demonstrates a brittle-to-ductile transition, as evidenced by increased energy absorption and delayed failure. A design guideline for the initial crack geometry is suggested by correlating peak stress with the $W_\text{gap}$, within a certain range.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable Pre-reduction of Ferromanganese Oxides with Hydrogen: Heating Rate-Dependent Reduction Pathways and Microstructure Evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anurag Bajpai, Barak Ratzker, Shiv Shankar, Dierk Raabe, Yan Ma</p>
            <p>The reduction of ferromanganese ores into metallic feedstock is an energy-intensive process with substantial carbon emissions, necessitating sustainable alternatives. Hydrogen-based pre-reduction of manganese-rich ores offers a low-emission pathway to augment subsequent thermic Fe-Mn alloy production. However, reduction dynamics and microstructure evolution under varying thermal conditions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the influence of heating rate on the hydrogen-based direct reduction of natural Nchwaning ferromanganese ore and a synthetic analog. Non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis revealed a complex multistep reduction process with overlapping kinetic regimes. Isoconversional kinetic analysis showed increased activation energy with reduction degree, indicating a transition from surface-reaction to diffusion-controlled reduction mechanisms. Interrupted X-ray diffraction experiments suggested that slow heating enables complete conversion to MnO and metallic Fe, while rapid heating promotes Fe- and Mn-oxides intermixing. Thermodynamic calculations for the Fe-Mn-O system predicted the equilibrium phase evolution, indicating Mn stabilized Fe-containing spinel and halite phases. Microstructural analysis revealed that slow heating rate yields fine and dispersed Fe particles in a porous MnO matrix, while fast heating leads to sporadic Fe-rich agglomerates. These findings suggest heating rate as a critical parameter governing reduction pathway, phase distribution, and microstructure evolution, thus offering key insights for optimizing hydrogen-based pre-reduction strategies towards more efficient and sustainable ferromanganese production.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle J. Ray, Alexander B. Boyd</p>
            <p>Many have speculated whether nonequilibrium systems obey principles of maximum or minimum entropy production. In this work, we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive the condition for the minimum entropy production state (MEPS) for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), even far from equilibrium. We show that real nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) generally violate both the MINEP and MAXEP principles. However, through numerical sampling of large interconnected CTMCs, we find that as system size increases, the steady-state entropy production tends to converge toward the minimum. This suggests that large nonequilibrium systems may self-organize to make efficient use of thermodynamic resources, offering a nuanced perspective on the longstanding debate between MAXEP and MINEP.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimple Rani, B. R. K. Nanda, Prasanjit Samal</p>
            <p>In the ongoing research on two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials with strong intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI), most efforts have focused on doping, Janus engineering, or heterostructure formation to break inversion symmetry and enhance spin--orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a pristine 2D material, monolayer H-FeTe$_2$, can naturally host robust DMI and magnetic anisotropy due to its intrinsic broken inversion symmetry and the strong SOC of Te atoms. We explore the effect of biaxial strain and electron correlation on H-FeTe$_2$ using first-principles DFT+$U$ calculations. We systematically investigate the Heisenberg exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and DMI in the space spanned by strain and correlation. Our results reveal a distinct, non-monotonic strain dependence of both magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and DMI, including a strain-tunable crossover between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic easy axes. A remarkable enhancement of the in-plane DMI is observed under the combined influence of strain and strong correlations, which is unusual for pristine 2D materials and suggests a favorable regime for spintronic this http URL, even in the absence of strain, H-FeTe$_2$ exhibits finite DMI and considerable anisotropy, which is rare for a pure 2D material. Through these findings, we present H-FeTe$_2$ as a unique pristine 2D system with robust and tunable spin interactions for exploring fundamental spin--orbit-driven magnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study the phases of an exactly solvable one dimensional model with $4-$dimensional $\Gamma-$matrix degrees of freedom on each site. The $\Gamma-$matrix model has a large set of competing interactions and displays a rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points. We work with the model with certain $Z_2$ symmetries and identify the allowed symmetry protected topological phases using the winding number as the topological invariant. The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio Davis</p>
            <p>Plasmas and other systems with long-range interactions are commonly found in non-equilibrium steady states that are outside traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, but can be described using generalized statistical mechanics frameworks such as superstatistics, where steady states are treated as superpositions of canonical ensembles under a temperature distribution. In this work we solve the problem of inferring the possible steady states of a composite system $AB$ where subsystem $A$ is described by superstatistics and $E_{AB} = E_A + E_B$. Our result establishes a closure property of superstatistics, namely that $A$ is described by superstatistics if and only if $AB$ and $B$ are also superstatistical with the same temperature distribution. Some consequences of this result are discussed, such as the impossibility of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) for additive subsystems in non-canonical steady states.</p>

In this work, density functional theory simulations are employed to systematically investigate these systems, including temperature-dependent effects and environmental conditions of fluorine saturation and deficiency. We investigated 20 distinct charge compensation schemes for each material, revealing lower defect formation energies in Th:LiSAF than in Th:LiCAF. This suggests that the former may attain a higher concentration of thorium nuclei. Furthermore, we calculated the electric field gradient for the lowest energy structure per compensation pathway. Our investigation shows that results previously reported in the literature apply only to a subset of experimental conditions.</p>

            <p>Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Kumar Das</p>
            <p>This article proposes a novel approach for determining exact solutions to nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The recommended iterative method provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions, and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined. Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact and unique.</p>

Using the determinant state mapping, we can naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.</p>

            <p>Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</p>

The system is relevant to optics and BEC. The spectrum of the linearized system is found in analytical and numerical forms. SSB and SASB are predicted by dint of the variational approximation, and studied in the numerical form. A particular stable solution, which demonstrates strong asymmetry, is found in an exact form. In the system with the attractive nonlinearity, the SSB of the symmetric ground state is initiated by the modulational instability. It creates stationary asymmetric states through a supercritical bifurcation. In the self-repulsive system, SASB makes the lowest antisymmetric excited state unstable, transforming it into an antisymmetry-breaking oscillatory mode.</p>

            <p>We present a general, constructive procedure to find the basis for tensors of arbitrary order subject to linear constraints by transforming the problem to that of finding the nullspace of a linear operator. The proposed method utilizes standard numerical linear algebra techniques that are highly optimized and well-behaved. Our primary applications are in mechanics where modulus tensors and so-called structure tensors can be used to characterize anisotropy of functional dependencies on other inputs such as strain. Like modulus tensors, structure tensors are defined by their invariance to transformations by symmetry group generators but have more general applicability. The fully automated method is an alternative to classical, more intuition-reliant methods such as the Pipkin-Rivlin polynomial integrity basis construction. We demonstrate the utility of the procedure by: (a) enumerating elastic modulus tensors for common symmetries, and (b) finding the lowest-order structure tensors that can represent all common point groups/crystal classes. Furthermore, we employ these results in two calibration problems using neural network models following classical function representation theory: (a) learning the symmetry class and orientation of a hyperelastic material given stress-strain data, and (b) representing strain-dependent anisotropy of the stress response of a soft matrix-stiff fiber composite in a sequence of uniaxial loadings. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the method in model selection and calibration by: (a) determining structural tensors of a selected order across multiple symmetry groups, and (b) determining a basis for a given group that allows the characterization of all subgroups. Using a common order in both cases allows sparse regression to operate on a common function representation to select the best-fit symmetry group for the data.</p>

We show that the latter modification can be understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs. Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.</p>

However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</p>

            <p>We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with $z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects, with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the $W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The $L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.</p>

            <p>Paper fragments in free fall constitute a simple yet paradigmatic mechanical system exhibiting remarkably complex motions. Despite a long history of investigation, this system has defied comprehensive first-principles modeling, motivating the development of phenomenological and experimental approaches to classify the free-fall dynamics of small paper fragments. Here we apply the Bandt-Pompe symbolization method to extract high-dimensional features corresponding to ordinal-pattern transitions (so-called ordinal networks) from observed area time series of video-recorded falling papers shaped as circles, squares, hexagons, and crosses. We then represent each trajectory as a node in a weighted similarity network, with edges encoding pairwise dynamical similarity, and identify motion classes via community detection. Our method automatically clusters trajectories into tumbling and chaotic falls in excellent agreement with expert visual classification. Notably, it outperforms previous approaches based on classical physical features derived from complete three-dimensional trajectories -- especially for cross-shaped papers -- and requires no prior specification of the number of motion classes. We further find that trajectories diverging from expert classifications occupy more central positions in the similarity network, suggesting more complex and ambiguous dynamic behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kshiteej J. Deshmukh, Graeme W. Milton</p>
            <p>Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor, characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial ($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of $\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor. Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in two-dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.</p>

            <h2>Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Camron Farhang, Weihang Lu, Kai Du, Yunpeng Gao, Junjie Yang, Sang-Wook Cheong, Jing Xia</p>
            <p>The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirco Erpelding, Adrian Braemer, Martin G√§rttner</p>
            <p>Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Naji, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, M. Abdi</p>
            <p>We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</p>

            <p>Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties. Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Nejad, Andrew Zhu, Kesha Sorathia, David P. Tew</p>
            <p>We present domain-based local pair natural orbital M√∏ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{√°}rm{√°}n boundary (BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2 methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations, and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.</p>

            <p>We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital M√∏ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach, Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals. Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs Born--von K{√°}rm{√°}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to 15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.</p>

            <p>We report the development of a variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) system capable of stable and highly sensitive operation over a wide temperature range based on a GM-cooler-based cryogen-free cryostat. The system incorporates a custom-designed phase-locked loop and automatic gain control, along with passive vibration isolation, enabling precise measurements of local chemical potential even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate the performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene (MLG), revealing spatially resolved electronic inhomogeneities and charge puddles. Our measurements clearly capture temperature-dependent variations in the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context. The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yash Arya, Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks, particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation, incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous degree distributions and community structures, which are typical characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more biologically informed neural networks.</p>

            <h2>Testing APS conjecture on regular graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Tao, Fen Zuo</p>
            <p>The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.</p>

This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>We compute the joint distribution of two consecutive eigenphase spacings and their ratio for Haar-distributed $\mathrm{U}(N)$ matrices (the circular unitary ensemble) using our framework for J√°nossy densities in random matrix theory, formulated via the Tracy-Widom system of nonlinear PDEs. Our result shows that the leading finite-$N$ correction in the gap-ratio distribution relative to the universal sine-kernel limit is of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-4})$, reflecting a nontrivial cancellation of the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})$ part present in the joint distributions of consecutive spacings. This finding suggests the potential to extract subtle finite-size corrections from the energy spectra of quantum-chaotic systems and explains why the deviation of the gap-ratio distribution of the Riemann zeta zeros $\{1/2+i\gamma_n\}, \gamma_n\approx T\gg1$ from the sine-kernel prediction scales as $\left(\log(T/2\pi)\right)^{-3}$.</p>

            <h2>Non-smooth optimization meets automated material model discovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moritz Flaschel, Trevor Hastie, Ellen Kuhl</p>
            <p>Automated material model discovery disrupts the tedious and time-consuming cycle of iteratively calibrating and modifying manually designed models. Non-smooth L1-norm regularization is the backbone of automated model discovery; however, the current literature on automated material model discovery offers limited insights into the robust and efficient minimization of non-smooth objective functions. In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of the form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a metric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed data, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the solution. We investigate both the straightforward case where f is quadratic and the more complex scenario where it is non-quadratic or even non-convex. Importantly, we do not only focus on methods that solve the sparse regression problem for a given value of the regularization parameter a, but propose methods to efficiently compute the entire regularization path, facilitating the selection of a suitable a. Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss their roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we recapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the minimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also known as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically determines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set to zero. Third, we propose to use the proximal gradient method ISTA for automated material model discovery if f is not quadratic, and fourth, we suggest a pathwise extension of ISTA for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate the applicability of all algorithms for the discovery of hyperelastic material models from uniaxial tension and simple shear data.</p>

            <p>A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular, the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling. While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique, highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate formulas.</p>

            <p>Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S.S. Afonin, A.V. Tulub</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the polaron theory from solid state physics can serve as an interesting analogue model for non-perturbative QCD, at least in the description of nucleons and related low-energy physics of strong interactions. By drawing explicit analogies between polaron physics, arising for an electron moving in an ionic crystal, and physics of pion-nucleon interactions, certain rules for the "polaron/QCD correspondence" are proposed. In polaron theory, the effective fermion mass as a function of the coupling constant is known both in the weak and strong coupling limits. The conjectured "polaron/QCD correspondence" translates these results into strong interactions. It is then shown how application of these rules leads to unexpectedly good quantitative predictions for the nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon sigma term. The polaron approach also predicts that the quark degrees of freedom in the form of the constituent quark account for one-third of the nucleon mass, consistent with lattice predictions. We discuss possible physical reasons underlying the observed quantitative similarity between polaron physics and non-perturbative QCD.</p>

            <p>Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</p>

            <p>An explicit formula for the interaction energy of $n$ vortices in the abelian Higgs (or Ginzburg-Landau) model is derived, valid in the regime where all vortices are close to one another. An immediate consequence of this formula is that the interaction energy of a vortex pair with separation $d$ varies as $d^4$, not $d^2$. The formula contains $n-1$ real coefficients which are fixed by certain spectral data of the Jacobi operator of the cocentred $n$-vortex. The coefficients are computed numerically for $n=2$ and $n=3$ for couplings $0.1\leq \lambda\leq 2.5$. The resulting short range interaction potentials are compared with the results of full field theory simulations for $\lambda=0.5$ and $\lambda=2$, with excellent agreement at small to moderate vortex separation.</p>

            <p>Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.</p>

            <p>An Ising model with random couplings on a graph is a model of a spin glass. While the mean field case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is very well studied, the more realistic lattice setting, known as the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model, has witnessed rather limited progress. In (Chatterjee,'23) chaotic properties of the ground state in the EA model were established via the study of the Fourier spectrum of the two-point spin correlation. A natural direction of research concerns fractal properties of the Fourier spectrum in analogy with critical percolation. In particular, numerical findings (Bray, Moore,'87) seem to support the belief that the fractal dimension of the associated spectral sample drawn according to the Fourier spectrum is strictly bigger than one. Towards this, in this note we introduce a percolation-type argument, relying on the construction of ``barriers'', to obtain new probabilistic lower bounds on the size of the spectral sample.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd≈ës-R√©nyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd≈ës-R√©nyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</p>

            <h2>Non-conservation of the valley density and its implications for the observation of the valley Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Kazantsev, Amelia Mills, Eoin O'Neill, Hao Sun, Giovanni Vignale, Alessandro Principi</p>
            <p>We show that the conservation of the valley density in multivalley insulators is broken in an unexpected way by the electric field that drives the valley Hall effect. This implies that time-reversal-invariant fully gapped insulators, in which no bulk or edge state crosses the Fermi level, can support a valley Hall current in the bulk and yet show no valley density accumulation at the edges. Thus, the valley Hall effect cannot be observed in such systems. If the system is not fully gapped then valley density accumulation at the edges is possible. The accumulation has no contribution from undergap states and can be expressed as a Fermi surface average, for which we derive an explicit formula. We demonstrate the theory by calculating the valley density accumulations in an archetypical valley-Hall insulator: a gapped graphene nanoribbon. Surprisingly, we discover that a net valley density polarization is dynamically generated for certain edge terminations.</p>

            <h2>Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Todor M. Mishonov, Nedeltcho I. Zahariev, Hassan Chamati, Albert M. Varonov</p>
            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals the importance of the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of $d$-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. This result suggests that the long-sought pairing mechanism in high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates has possibly been found and that the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates. To test the developed theoretical scheme, we explored in detail the recent results of the scanned Josephson modulation microscopy experiment of the modulation of the order parameter due to apex distance super-modulation. Our analysis shows a satisfactory agreement between our theory and the named experiment.</p>

            <p>We performed a detailed study of the intrinsic electronic structure of YRu2Si2 employing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density-functional theory (DFT) based firstprinciples calculations. Electrical and magnetic measurements were conducted on well-oriented highquality single crystals. Bulk physical measurements indicate that the compound exhibits slightly enhanced Pauli paramagnetic behavior, accompanied by electrical transport properties reminiscent of metals. Our ARPES data reveal four fold symmetric Fermi surface with weakly-dispersing bands around the N point originating from Ru d orbitals. We observed the anisotropic characteristics of the band near the N point, showing weak dispersion in the XNX direction and minimal dispersion along the NGN direction. The electronic band structure near the Fermi level is primarily governed by the Ru d orbital, with minor contributions from the Y d and Si p orbitals. Polarization-dependent ARPES results indicate the multi-band and multi-orbital band-character of YRu2Si2. Due to the negligible correlation effect, the observed ARPES data is found to be in good agreement with the DFT results.</p>

            <h2>Ultra-delayed material failure via shear banding after straining an amorphous material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry A. Lockwood, Emily S. Carrington, Suzanne M. Fielding</p>
            <p>We predict a phenomenon of catastrophic material failure arising suddenly within an amorphous material, with an extremely long delay time since the material was last deformed. By simulating a mesoscopic soft glassy rheology model in one dimension (1D), a mesoscopic elastoplastic model in 1D and 2D, and a continuum fluidity model in 1D, we demonstrate the basic physics to involve a dramatic ultra-delayed shear banding instability, in which strain suddenly strongly localises within the material and the stress drops precipitously. The delay time after the long historical shear strain was applied before failure occurs increases steeply with decreasing strain amplitude, decreasing working temperature, and increasing sample annealing prior to shear. In demonstrating the same physics -- which is directly testable experimentally and in particle simulations -- to obtain within three different constitutive models, we suggest it may be generic across amorphous materials. The counter-intuitive prediction of catastrophic material failure long after any deformation was last applied could have important consequences for material processing and performance.</p>

            <p>In the revised International System of Units (SI), the ohm and the volt are realized from the von Klitzing constant and the Josephson constant, and a practical realization of the ampere is possible by applying Ohm's law directly to the quantum Hall and Josephson effects. As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\mu\Omega$/$\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\mu$A/A to -30 $\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias.</p>

            <h2>Fokker-Planck approach to wave turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Schubring</p>
            <p>The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian. A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation. Similar equations are associated to divergences in higher-order cumulants. It is additionally shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.</p>

            <p>Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials</p>

            <p>We report a detailed investigation of the Fermi surface in the layered Dirac semimetal TaNiTe$_5$. We probed the magnetization, magnetic torque and magnetoresistance in high-quality single crystals.

Multiple fundamental frequencies and light effective quasiparticle masses are obtained by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula fits. The high resolution of the low-temperature FFT spectra allows us to investigate individual peaks in detail for the magnetic fields applied along all three crystallographic axes and the planes in between. Our investigation can confirm the density functional theory (DFT) calculated band structure and its corresponding Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>Motivated by a recent experimental study on the quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ that presented spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity (Chen et al., arXiv:2402.15869), we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz for infinite projected entangled-pair states. We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data - recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "$\Psi$" phase in the simulated spectra, which should be compared with future experimental results.</p>

            <h2>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Boyer, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr√∂dinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</p>

            <h2>Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ewan Scott, Michal Kwasigroch</p>
            <p>The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory -- an extension of Read-Newns theory to the underscreened Kondo lattice -- we observe in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale. We also notice that in some compounds the destabilisation of local crystalline anisotropy can be the beginning of a cascade of decreasing energy scales. Once the anisotropy changes, further growth of magnetic correlations with cooling can lead to a rapid quenching of the hard-axis susceptibility, and at even lower temperatures, the high-temperature easy axis is revealed via a metamagnetic jump when a high magnetic field is applied along it.</p>

            <h2>The Mechanics of Nucleation and Growth and the Surface Tensions of Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Langford, Ahmad K. Omar</p>
            <p>Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions. Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barbara Roos, Shoki Sugimoto, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel</p>
            <p>We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE) if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in MATE. Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta^{fF}$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0^{fF}$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0^{fF}$. Here, we first point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds, i.e., if every eigenbasis lies in MATE, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0^{fF}$. Inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0^{fF}$ for which MATE can be proved more easily than for the others, with smaller error bounds, and also in higher spatial dimensions, we show for any given $H_0$ that the existence of one eigenbasis in MATE implies quite generally that most eigenbases of $H_0$ lie in MATE. We also show that, as a consequence, after adding a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$, for most perturbations $V$ the perturbed Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies ETH and all states thermalize.</p>

            <p>Quantum computers are expected to enable fast solving of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, their limitations in fidelity and the number of qubits prevent them from handling real-world problems. Recently, a quantum-inspired solver using tensor networks has been proposed, which works on classical computers. Particularly, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. We showed mathematically that such feasible tensor networks can be constructed to accommodate various types of constraints. For the principle verification, we numerically constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem, to find much faster construction than conventional methods. Then, by performing imaginary time evolution, feasible solutions were always obtained, ultimately leading to the optimal solution.</p>

            <p>The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</p>

We prove that negative electronic specific heat, $C_\mathrm{el} < 0$, is sufficient to trigger the instability. Specifically, the instability sets in as soon as the quasiparticle weight becomes negative over a range of energies, even before $C_\mathrm{el}$ turns negative. This is an inherently nonequilibrium phenomenon, occurring prior to the formation of any equilibrium phase. Depending on the system, it can proceed along different pathways, ultimately resulting in a structural transition to an insulating or metallic state.</p>

            <p>Advances in controlled polymerization have enabled the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers like molecular knots and linear[n]catenane. These aesthetic macromolecules with unique topological constraints in the form of mechanical bonds are well known for their fascinating transport and rheological properties in the development of molecular machines and in knotted protein dynamics in biological applications. The diffusion dynamics of such macromolecular structures with large internal degrees of freedom are generally studied by using an equivalent size parameter, i.e., hydrodynamic radius, defined using Zimm theory. Although diffusion rates are expected to depend strongly on the molecular topological constraints in macromolecules, their explicit effects on translational and reorientational dynamics are still unknown. Here, we perform an in silico study on the diffusion dynamics of seven topologically distinct polymer chains in the limit of infinite dilution using multi-particle collision dynamics. The modeled polymers are linear, ring, linear[2]catenane, trefoil knot, linear[3]catenane, cyclic[3]catenane, and Borromean ring. The molecular weights of these macromolecules are selected such that the resulting hydrodynamic radius is approximately equal to each other. We show that while the translational diffusion coefficients of these topologically distinct polymer chains are approximately equal to each other in agreement with the Zimm theory, there are significant differences among the values of the corresponding rotational diffusion coefficients. We show that the presence of mechanical bonds in the polymer chains slows down the rotational diffusion significantly, thus suggesting the role of molecular topology on reaction kinetics of macromolecules.</p>

Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. V. Sreenivasa Reddy, Guang-Yu Guo</p>
            <p>The CoSi-family of materials (CoSi, CoGe, RhSi and RhGe) forms a cubic chiral structure and hosts unconventional multifold chiral fermions, such as spin-1 and spin-3/2 fermions, leading to intriguing phenomena like long Fermi arc surface states and exotic transport properties. Recent interest on the phonon behavior in chiral materials is growing due to their unique characteristics, including topological phonons, protected surface states and the chiral phonons with non-zero angular momentums. In this study, we explore the topological and chiral phonon behavior in RhGe, using first-principles density functional theory calculations as well as the symmetry and topological analysis. In particular, we uncover six spin-1 triply degenerate nodal points at the $\Gamma$ point and six charge-2 double Weyl points at the R point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). Interestingly, these topological features are identical to that in the electronic band structure without the electron spin-orbit coupling, of the same material. We expect that this finding not only applies to the CoSi family but also is universal. Secondly, we find that chiral crystal RhGe hosts chiral phonon modes with a phonon angular momentum (PAM) and an associated phonon magnetic moment (PMM), everywhere in the BZ except at high symmetry points such as $\Gamma$, R, X and M. The PAM and PMM are large along the chiral rotation axis and also in the vicinity of the topological nodes. Our study also reveals that all the topological phonon modes are chiral. However, the reverse is not always true. Among other things, our finding of the coexistence of topological and chiral phonon modes in chiral RhGe not only deepens our understanding of the phonon behavior in the CoSi-family but also opens new pathways for developing advanced materials and devices.</p>

            <p>The $1/r$ long-range interaction, induced by laser illumination, offers a mechanism for the implementation of stable self-trapping in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the three-dimensional free space. Using the variational approximation and numerical solutions, we find that self-trapped states in this setting , with attractive nonlocal and repulsive local interactions, resemble tightly-bound compactons. However, these are not true compactons but rather \textit{tightly self-trapped modes} (TSTMs), with small-amplitude nonvanishing tails. The structure of the self-trapped states is explained by an analytical solution for their tails. Further, we demonstrate that stable % TSTMs with embedded vorticity, exist in the same setting, with winding numbers up to $S=6$ (at least). Addressing two-TSTM interactions, we find that pairs of ground states (GSs, with $S=0$), as well as vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex pairs (with $S_1=S_2$ and $S_1=-S_2$, respectively), form stably rotating bound states. Head-on collisions between vortex TSTMs, set in slow motion by kicks, are inelastic, resulting in their merger into a GS soliton, that may either remain at the collision position or move aside, shedding the angular momentum with emitted radiation, or, alternatively, lead to the formation of a vortex that also moves aside.</p>

            <p>Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the long-standing trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has limited their practical applications. We present DeePTB-NEGF, an integrated framework combining deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian prediction with non-equilibrium Green's Function methodology to enable accurate quantum transport simulations in open boundary conditions with 2-3 orders of magnitude acceleration. We demonstrate DeePTB-NEGF through two challenging applications: comprehensive break junction simulations with over $10^4$ snapshots, showing excellent agreement with experimental conductance histograms; and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FET) at experimental dimensions, reproducing measured transfer characteristics for a 41 nm channel CNT-FET ($\sim 8000$ atoms, $3\times10^4$ orbitals) and predicting zero-bias transmission spectra for a 180 nm CNT ($\sim 3\times 10^4$ atoms, $10^5$ orbitals), showcasing the framework's capability for large-scale device simulations. Our systematic studies across varying geometries confirm the necessity of simulating realistic experimental structures for precise predictions. DeePTB-NEGF bridges the longstanding gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a scalable tool for high-throughput and large-scale quantum transport simulations that enables previously inaccessible nanoscale device investigations.</p>

            <p>This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</p>

            <p>Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.</p>

            <h2>Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys using DFPT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surya T. Bijjala, Susan R. Atlas, Pankaj Kumar</p>
            <p>The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</p>

Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.</p>

            <p>Soft pair potentials predict a reentrant liquid phase for high concentrations, a behavior not observed experimentally. Here, very soft microgels confined at an oil-water interface are used as a model system of particles interacting via a soft potential in 2D. Interfacial rheology measurements demonstrate the existence of different flow regimes that depend on the compression of the monolayer. Such a compression also leads to a non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli and of the yield stress of the monolayer. These results, together with the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer, are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D system of particles interacting with a Hertzian-like potential. Remarkably, due to the non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli, we observe \textit{isoelastic} points where the monolayer shows the same stiffness at very different concentrations. These points are the experimental manifestation of the predicted reentrant liquid phase.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto \omega^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana spinors. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum-classical mapping, since it is applicable for $s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and the weakly subohmic case $s\lesssim 1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the ohmic bosonic thermal bath.</p>

Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive, within a non-pertubative treatment of disorder effects, the third-order nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps. In the weak nonlinear regime of our formalism, we demonstrate the ability of the echo peak to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes, in perfect agreement with the intuition developed in isolated two-level systems. Furthermore, we discuss unique many-body effects on the echo peak signature arising from interaction induced quantum fluctuations. In particular, we show that these quantum fluctuations induce a finite nonrephasable broadening and examine how the echo peak is influenced by the attractive or repulsive nature of the collective excitations.</p>

            <p>Wide-band gap oxides such as ZnO offer a favorable environment for spin defect qubits due to their dilute nuclear spin background and potential for ultra-high purity. Identifying deep-level defect qubits is essential for room-temperature optical initialization and quantum emission, robust against environmental noise. In this work, we theoretically design deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. By employing first-principles calculations, we predict that the molybdenum-vacancy complex has promising spin and optical properties, including a spin-triplet ground state, optically-allowable transition in the visible range with a high quantum yield, and an exceptionally small Huang-Rhys factor around 5, compared to 10-30 in known defects in ZnO. In particular, we found a long spin decoherence T2 time at 4 ms after considering both nuclear spin baths and paramagnetic impurity baths' interactions, with the latter dominant at impurity concentration above 0.035 ppm. Finally, we predict the energy diagram with spin-selective intersystem crossing for a spin-photon interface, and suggest the protocols for efficient optical readout. With a strong spin-orbit coupling and the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion in the proposed defect, we reveal that it supports high-fidelity single-shot readout of electron-spin at high temperature and a wide range of magnetic field.</p>

We characterize the bath-impurity phase diagram and reveal the appearance of a correlated counterflow phase, which we support with an analytical model for a mobile impurity-hole pair. This phase shows an extended combined insulator domain of unity filling but no independent domain of constant density. The transition to this phase features a sudden orthogonality and the change of the shape of the impurity's profile to that of a free particle in an infinite square well. The findings of this work suggest the appearance of unconventional counterflow in trapped imbalanced atomic mixtures.</p>

            <p>We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha >D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha > 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains L√©vy diffusion for $\alpha < 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha > D$.</p>

            <p>The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays ferromagnetism-like properties with compensated magnetization, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Furthermore, we extend the stacking rule to collinear compensated ferrimagnets, where the opposite-spin sublattices are not connected by any symmetry operator, yet the net magnetization remains zero. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 and Fe2MoSe4 bilayers. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.</p>

This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet.

            <p>Stability of elongated (``slender") quantum droplets (QDs) with embedded unitary and multiple vorticity is a problem that was not solved previously. In this work, we propose a solution which relies upon the use of the spatial modulation of the inter-species scattering length in the binary Bose-Einstein condensates, in the form of a two-dimensional axisymmetric Gaussian, shaped by means of the optical Feshbach resonance. The corresponding effective nonlinear trapping potential supports completely stable elongated QDs with vorticity $S=0$ and partly stable families of elongated QDs with $S=1,2,3,4$ (other nonlinear systems do not maintain stability of vortex droplets with $\geq 2$). We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with $% S=1$ moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with $S=\pm 1$ are quasi-elastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs. Application of a torque to the vector QD sets in the gyroscopic regime of robust precession, which realizes a macroscopic spin-orbit-coupling effect.</p>

            <p>The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by the interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1\textdegree\ hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3\textdegree, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37\textdegree\ twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moir√© cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands over unusually large ranges of density. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of behavior commonly seen in magic-angle samples near integer filling at low magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form.

            <p>$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviors, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviors, interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbor interlayer interaction is the XXZ type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide insights into the exotic behaviors and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</p>

            <p>Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</p>

            <h2>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</p>

            <h2>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</h2>

            <p>DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.</p>

            <h2>A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangjun Xing (Wilczek Quantum Center, School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China)</p>
            <p>We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.</p>

            <h2>Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents: Application in a non-integer dimensional Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira</p>
            <p>Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.</p>

            <h2>Searching for evidence of strengthening from short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Novin Rasooli, Matthew Daly</p>
            <p>The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains debated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct observation of this effect is elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that instead searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns suggesting a positive finding may be explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. R. Parymuda</p>
            <p>We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</p>

            <p>We report a novel approach to engineering large voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) and enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface of single-layer graphene (SLG) and NiFe (Py) through non-covalent functionalization with Platinum (II) 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl porphyrin (Pt-porphyrin). Using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown SLG, we demonstrate that Pt-porphyrin functionalization significantly increases the SOC and enables robust voltage modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy, as confirmed by spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJ/(V-m)) is achieved, accompanied by an order-of-magnitude enhancement in spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) compared to pristine SLG. The resonance field exhibits a clear, reversible shift under applied gate voltage, confirming robust electric-field modulation of interfacial magnetic anisotropy. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the structural integrity and effective charge transfer at the functionalized interface. Electrical characterization of back-gated graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) further reveals tunable electronic properties upon functionalization. Our results establish functionalized graphene/ferromagnet interfaces as a promising platform for low-power, voltage-controlled spintronic devices, paving the way for scalable, energy-efficient memory and logic technologies</p>

            <h2>Periodic Drive Induced Half-Metallic Phase in Insulators and Correlated Metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suryashekhar Kusari, Arnab Das, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Arti Garg</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Strange metal and Fermi arcs from disordering spin stripes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Zhang, Nick Bultinck</p>
            <p>We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun Liu, Mi Jiang</p>
            <p>Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vibhu Mishra, Salvatore Manmana, Stefan Kehrein</p>
            <p>The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</p>

We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems.

            <p>A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions.

            <p>Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</p>

            <h2>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M.S. Kim</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R√©nyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R√©nyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha>1$, while is a constant for $\alpha<1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael K.-H. Kiessling, Boris L. Altshuler, Emil A. Yuzbashyan</p>
            <p>The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied, in which the effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by generally dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega>0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega =: \lambda P(d\omega)$, formally defining a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ with compact support, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)>0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences constructed in the paper. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with a constant $C$ that is a factor $\approx 2.034$ larger than the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.</p>

            <p>Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</p>

Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</p>

            <h2>Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaibhav Sharma, Erich J Mueller</p>
            <p>We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can simultaneously extract many quantitative features of a state including some traditional quantities such as entanglement depth, k-uniformity and entanglement entropy. Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</p>

            <h2>Order in disorder: increased carrier mobility of downscaled amorphous semiconductors for high-speed thin film transistors in flexible electronics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuezhou Luo, Andrew John Flewitt</p>
            <p>Amorphous semiconductors are important channel semiconductors in thin film transistors (TFTs) which serve not only active-matrix displays, but also flexible electronics for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, a great limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities relative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established band fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous semiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling, without any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the intrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long gap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device uniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band tail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation length scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and medium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Masi, Itai Einav</p>
            <p>The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</p>

            <h2>Interface Energy and Phase Transformations: A Comparative Analysis of Cahn-Hilliard and CALPHAD-based Models in Ternary Substitutional Alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wolfgang Flachberger, Thomas Antretter, Swaroop Gaddikere-Nagaraja, Silvia Leitner, Manuel Petersmann, Jiri Svoboda</p>
            <p>There are various methods for modeling phase transformations in materials science, including general classes of phase-field methods and reactive diffusion methodologies, which most importantly differ in their treatment of interface energy. These methodologies appear mutually exclusive since the respective numerical schemes only allow for their primary use case. To address this issue, a novel methodology for modeling phase transformations in multi-phase, multi-component systems, with particular emphasis on applications in materials science and the study of substitutional alloys is introduced. The fundamental role of interface energy in the evolution of a material's morphology will be studied by example of binary and ternary systems. Allowing full control over the interface energy quantity enables more detailed investigations and bridges the gaps between known methods. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases, such as vacancy-mediated diffusion. Furthermore a scheme for relating Onsager and Diffusion coefficients is proposed, which allows us to study the intricate coupling that is observed in multicomponent systems. We hope to contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mircea Bejan, Benjamin B√©ri, Max McGinley</p>
            <p>We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saverio Rossi, Leonardo Di Bari, Martin Weigt, Francesco Zamponi</p>
            <p>Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences - particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary dynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms.</p>

            <p>Developing neutron spectrometers with higher counting efficiency has been an essential pursuit in neutron instrumentation. In this work, we present BOYA, a multiplexing cold neutron spectrometers designed and implemented at the China Advanced Research Reactor. Equipped with 34 angular analyzing channels spanning 119¬∞, each containing 5 inelastic channels and 1 diffraction channel, BOYA enhances the measurement efficiency by two orders of magnitude over a traditional triple-axis spectrometer. To optimize both intensity and energy resolution, innovative double-column Rowland focusing analyzers have been developed. By filling the crystal gaps in the traditional Rowland focusing geometry, our design enhances the neutron beam coverage without introducing appreciable double-scattering. Our commissioning results on vanadium and MnWO4 have confirmed the success of the design, establishing BOYA as a successful multiplexing instrument for neutron spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaoling Yang, Victor Montenegro, Abolfazl Bayat</p>
            <p>The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</p>

            <h2>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin S. Sloth</p>
            <p>I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubbled-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time-scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</p>

            <p>Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential. Quantum correction is incorporated in the drift potential, and is determined by quasi-stationary conditions and minimal uncertainty relation. The semiclassical rate obtained here is consistent in form with those from the quantum Smoluchowski equations deduced heuristically by modifying the diffusion coefficient using the path-integral method. Unlike approaches using the path-integral, which involves continuation into imaginary time, the approach here is simpler and more easily understood in terms of classical picture.</p>

            <h2>Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</p>

            <p>A fourth-order Schr√∂dinger equation for the description of charge transport in semiconductors in the ballistic regime is proposed with the inclusion of non-parabolic effects in the dispersion relation in order to go beyond the simple effective mass approximation. Similarly to the standard (second order) Schr√∂dinger equation, the problem is reduced to a finite spatial domain with appropriate transparent boundary conditions to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler (Lent and Kirkner in J Appl Phys 67:6353, 1990; Ben Abdallah et al. in ZAMP 48:135-155, 1997; Ben Abdallah in J. Math. Phys. 41:4241-4261, 2000), where an active region representing an electron device is coupled to leads which take the role of reservoirs. Some analytical properties are investigated, and a generalized formula for the current is obtained. Numerical results show the main features of the solutions of the new model. In particular, an effect of interference appears due to a richer wave structure than that arising for the second-order Schr√∂dinger equation in the effective mass approximation.</p>

            <p>The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</p>

            <p>Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understanding modern-day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemics spreading through society. However, such processes are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process, or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically, focusing on processes that can be interpreted as driven by interactions between populations of different types of individuals in the network. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics that significantly simplifies the problem, and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on networks.</p>

            <p>Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</p>

To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-three-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed three-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <p>Evidence is presented that the accuracy of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics framework is improved using the coupled entropy, which carefully establishes the physical measures of complex systems. While Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset, questions have persisted as to how to evaluate whether its proposed solutions properly characterize the uncertainty of heavy-tailed distributions. The entropy of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is $1+\kappa+\ln\sigma$, where $\kappa$ is the shape or nonlinear coupling and $\sigma$ is the scale. A generalized entropy should retain the uncertainty due to the scale, while minimizing the dependence of the nonlinear coupling. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD instead subtracts a function of the inverse-scale and converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. Colloquially, the Tsallis entropy is too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) rectifies the positive dependence on the scale but introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy measures the uncertainty of the GPD to be $1+\ln_\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\sigma=1+\frac{1+\kappa}{\kappa}(\sigma^\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}-1)$, which converges to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. The training of the coupled variational autoencoder is an example of the unique ability of the coupled entropy to improve the performance of complex systems.</p>

            <p>Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr√∂dinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</p>

            <p>Zhou et al., in their recent publication (Nat.

They observed a gradual decrease in the 1H-NMR signal intensity assigned to the synthesized metal hydride, accompanied by an increase in molecular hydrogen within the sample chamber over a period of 50 days. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that LaH10 progressively decomposes into LaH3 and H2 within two months after synthesis at its formation pressure of 170 GPa. Here, we demonstrate that, under their formation conditions, metal superhydrides are thermodynamically more stable than metal trihydrides. Furthermore, we present direct experimental evidence - based on X-ray diffraction and four-probe electrical resistance measurements - confirming the stability of both the crystal lattice and high-temperature superconducting properties of the Fm-3m-LaH10 phase for more than five years. This long-term stability is consistent with predictions from quantum chemistry calculations.</p>

            <h2>Ultrasensitive Magnetometer based on Cusp Points of the Photon-Magnon Synchronization Mode</h2>

            <p>Ultrasensitive magnetometers based on spin resonances have led to remarkable achievements. However, the gyromagnetic ratios of these spin resonances that determine the responsivity of magnetometers to weak magnetic fields are inherently constrained by the Land$\acute{e}$ g-factor of particles, such as the electron, with a constant gyromagnetic ratio of $\gamma_e=2\pi\times28$ GHz/T. Here, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive magnetometer based on the cusp point (CP) of photon-magnon synchronization modes (PMSMs). The PMSM's gyromagnetic ratio at the CP is enhanced to $37\gamma_e$ and further amplified to $236\gamma_e$ by utilizing the sixth-order oscillating mode of the PMSM. Moreover, the emission linewidth of the PMSM can be reduced to 0.06 Hz, resulting in excellent sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. These outstanding properties position our magnetometer to potentially achieve superior sensitivity to conventional magnetometers. Our work introduces a cost-effective prototype for the next generation of magnetometry, and may advance scientific research and technologies that rely on ultrasensitive magnetic field detection.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anwei Zhang, C. M. Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <h2>Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kateryna Foyevtsova, Ilya Elfimov, George A. Sawatzky</p>
            <p>An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</p>

            <p>We show how amplitude modulated, coherent high-frequency drives can be used to access otherwise difficult to reach collective resonances and off-resonantly induce parametric instabilities. In particular, we demonstrate that difficult to access antiferromagnetic resonances in the THz range can be parametrically excited with signals at optical frequencies via a mechanism that we call Modulated Floquet Parametric Driving (MFPD). We study spin pumping and the formation of entangled, two-mode squeezed magnon pairs in anisotropic antiferromagnets under MFPD. Furthermore, we show that MFPD induces transitions to symmetry breaking steady-states in which dynamical spin patterns are formed by resonant magnon pairs.</p>

            <h2>Off-resonant light-induced topological phase transition and thermoelectric transport in semi-Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vassilios Vargiamidis, P. Vasilopoulos, Neophytos Neophytou</p>
            <p>We show that a semi-Dirac (SD) system with an inversion symmetry breaking mass exhibits a topological phase transition when irradiated with off-resonant light. Using Floquet theory, we derive the band structure, Chern numbers, phase diagram, and we show that as the light intensity is swept at fixed mass, the SD system undergoes normal-Chern-normal insulator transition. Along the phase boundaries we observe single semi-Dirac-cone (SSDC) semimetal states in which one SD cone is gapless and the other gapped. The nontrivial Berry curvature distribution $\Omega(\mathbf{k}) \neq -\Omega ( - \mathbf{k} )$ generates an orbital magnetization $M$ and anomalous Nernst ($\alpha_{xy}$) and thermal Hall ($\kappa_{xy}$) conductivities. We show that $M$ remains constant as the Fermi level $E_F$ scans the insulating gap, but it changes linearly with it in the Chern insulator (CI) phase, as expected. In the normal insulator phase, we find that $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits a dip-peak profile which is reversed in the CI phase. We also find that switching the light's circular polarization from left to right induces a sign change in $M$, $\alpha_{xy}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$, regardless of the topological phase, thereby allowing us to reverse the direction of flow of the transverse charge and heat currents. Further, we evaluate the components of the charge ($\sigma_{aa}$), thermoelectric ($\alpha_{aa}$), and thermal ($\kappa_{aa}$) conductivity tensors ($a=x, y$) and examine the effect of light on them. With a linear dispersion along the $y$-direction, we find that $\alpha_{yy}$ and $\kappa_{yy}$ are significantly larger than $\alpha_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$, respectively, due to the much larger squared Dirac velocity $v_y^2$ compared to $v_x^2$.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$, a charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, offers a platform to explore this interplay. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ via high-field magnetotransport measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using three distinct field-current configurations, we resolve four out of five FS pockets predicted in the CDW phase, with no evidence of residual non-CDW features - in contrast to recent ARPES studies. Remarkably, we identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical hole pocket and a high-frequency quantum oscillation contribution to the magnetoresistance attributable to magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29 eV. Additionally, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance (MR) for all field orientations when current flows along the $a-$axis, with a distinct high-field linear MR regime emerging near the $c-$axis, consistent with FS hot spots and magnetic breakdown. Our results establish TaTe$_4$ as a paradigmatic system where CDW-driven FS reconstruction governs the bulk electronic structure, enabling new routes to probe the novel physics that can arise in the intersection between correlated electronic states and topological band features.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chang Chen, Yu-Chen Chang</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal charge transport (NCT) is defined as a phenomenon where electrical resistance depends on the current direction. It has been drawing much attention because it sensitively reflects the symmetry breaking of material systems. A topological insulator (TI)/superconductor (SC) heterostructure where the topological surface state (TSS) of the TI layer is proximitized with the SC layer is one such system that presents a sizable NCT due to a large spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity. Here, we report a control of the magnitude and sign of NCT: reversal of the direction of NCT by tuning the Fermi energy of TSS of the TI layer with respect to the charge neutral point by systematic regulation of Sb composition $x$ in a TI/SC heterostructures of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$/FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$. The result is consistent with the model of a TSS proximitized with superconductivity. Furthermore, we find a significant enhancement of the magnitude of NCT in the TI/SC heterostructures by reducing the thickness of the SC layer. The enhancement can be ascribed to the inversion-symmetry breaking of the FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$ SC-layer itself adjacent to the TI layer. Our results highlight the essential role of the TSS for exhibiting NCT and offer new knobs to control the direction and magnitude of NCT.</p>

            <h2>Modulation of energy and angular momentum radiation of two-dimensional altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong-Mei Zhang, Zhi- Ping Niu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the energy and angular momentum radiation of altermagnets under Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and external magnetic fields. Using an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we derive electronic energy bands and calculate optical conductivity via the Kubo formula. Results show that RSOC strength, altermagnet interactions strength, and Neel vector direction notably affect the optical conductivity of altermagnet metals. Energy radiation is highly sensitive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, with a saturation effect beyond a particular value, and its peak emission rate is lower than that of graphene due to reduced conductivity. Different from usual semi-conductor, semi-metal or Dirac materials, eg. graphene or silicene, altermagnets generate angular momentum radiation with specific Rashba spin-orbit coupling and altermagnet interaction strength. Angular momentum radiation is minimally reactive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling at low altermagnet interactions strength values but exhibits drastic oscillations between extreme values as altermagnet interactions strength reaches a critical point, showing high sensitivity. These findings suggest that adjusting these parameters can tailor altermagnet applications in spintronics and quantum technologies, potentially leading to innovative devices with customized radiation attributes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Avanzini, Massimiliano Esposito, Emanuele Penocchio</p>
            <p>We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals new key principles for their design and optimization.</p>

            <p>Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</p>

            <p>A Dirac quantum spin liquid hosts Dirac spinons, which are low-energy fractionalized neutral quasiparticles with spin 1/2 that obey the Dirac equation. Recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed a cone spin continuum in YCu$_3$(OD)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{x}$(OD)$_{1-x}$], consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. In this work, we further studied spin excitations using the inelastic neutron scattering technique. The width of low-energy spin excitations shows a linear temperature dependence, which can be explained by spinon-spinon interactions with a Dirac dispersion. Polarized neutron scattering measurements reveal that in-plane magnetic fluctuations are about 1.5 times stronger than the out-of-plane ones, suggesting the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and consistent with our theoretical modeling and simulations. Moreover, the high-energy spin excitations around 14 meV agree with the one-pair spinon-antispinon excitations in Raman studies. The real part of the dynamical susceptibility derived from the Kramers-Kronig relationship also agrees with the Knight shift measured by nuclear magnetic resonance, clearly demonstrating the negligible effects of magnetic impurities on static susceptibility. These results provide a rare example in studying quantum-spin-liquid materials where different experimental techniques can be directly compared, and they give further insights for the possible Dirac quantum spin liquid in this system.</p>

Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering, not to be confused with multiple Andreev reflection. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.</p>

            <p>Experimental studies on moir√© materials have predominantly focused on twisted hexagonal lattice with low-energy states near the $\Gamma$- or K-points, where the electronic dispersion is typically isotropic. In contrast, we introduce a class of semiconducting transition metal carbides (MXenes) $M_2$C$T_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y; $T$ = O, F, Cl) as a new platform for M-valley moir√© materials, which exhibit pronounced anisotropic properties. Using Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and Zr$_2$CO$_2$ as representative examples, we perform large-scale \emph{ab initio} calculations and demonstrate that their AB-stacked twisted homobilayer hosts three threefold rotational-symmetry-related M-valleys with time-reversal symmetry. These systems show striking anisotropic band flattening in the conduction band minimum. To elucidate the underlying physics, we construct a simplified moir√© Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of the band structure, revealing the origins of anisotropic flattening through the mechanisms of band folding and interlayer tunneling. Our findings expand the current landscape of moir√© materials, establishing valley- and spin-degenerate, two-dimensional arrays of quasi-one-dimensional systems as promising platforms for exploring many interesting correlated electronic phases.</p>

            <p>In this article, we present a novel box-covering algorithm for analyzing the fractal properties of complex networks. Unlike traditional algorithms that impose a predetermined box size, our approach assigns nodes to boxes identified by their nearest local hubs without enforcing rigid distance constraints. This flexibility leads to a key methodological shift: instead of fixing the box size in advance, we first determine the number of boxes and then compute their average size. We argue that this procedure is fully consistent with the recently proposed scaling theory of fractal complex networks and closely related to the concept of hidden metric spaces in which network nodes are embedded. We demonstrate that our approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, but also (despite relaxing constraints on box diameter) covers networks using boxes of more similar sizes than, for instance, the classical greedy coloring (GC) algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze nine complex networks (three model-based and six real-world) representing a broad spectrum: from networks with confirmed fractality, through those with initially uncertain, but here confirmed, fractal properties (such as the Internet at the level of autonomous systems), to large-scale networks that have so far remained beyond the reach of existing algorithms due to their size.</p>

            <p>CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate. This work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent conduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck thermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and by electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a multicarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands dominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore, DFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi level and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is experimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped Cr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable electronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in devices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</p>

            <p>Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Banik Rai, Nitesh Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusplike feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this article, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the nonorthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, nonorthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a nonorthogonal external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0<s<1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV and QP models may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Projected Spin-AGP Methods Applied to Spin Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Liu, Thomas M. Henderson, Gustavo E. Scuseria</p>
            <p>Symmetry-projected wave function methods capture static correlation by breaking and restoring the symmetries of a system. In this article, we present the symmetry-projected spin antisymmetrized geminal power (spin-AGP) state projected onto space group symmetry as well as complex conjugation, spin-flip, and time-reversal symmetries. The method is benchmarked on the 1D XXZ model and 2D $\mathrm{J_1-J_2}$ model with square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate that symmetry projection methods provide a powerful tool for frustrated spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty-aware electronic density-functional distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teitur Hansen, Jens J√∏rgen Mortensen, Thomas Bligaard, Karsten Wedel Jacobsen</p>
            <p>We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Graph neural network-based structural classification of glass-forming liquids and its interpretation via self-attention mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Yoshikawa, Kentaro Yano, Shota Goto, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi</p>
            <p>Glass-forming liquids exhibit slow dynamics below their melting temperatures, maintaining an amorphous structure reminiscent of normal liquids. Distinguishing microscopic structures in the supercooled and high-temperature regimes remains a debated topic. Building on recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our study automatically extracts features, unveiling fundamental mechanisms driving structural changes at varying temperatures. We employ the self-attention mechanism to generate attention coefficients that quantify the importance of connections between graph nodes, providing insights into the rationale behind GNN predictions. Exploring structural changes with decreasing temperature through the GNN+self-attention using physically-defined structural descriptors, including the bond-orientational order parameter, Voronoi cell volume, and coordination number, we identify strong correlations between high attention coefficients and more disordered structures as a key indicator of variations in glass-forming liquids.</p>

            <h2>Quasi-bound layer-breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Enaldiev</p>
            <p>Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer-breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moir√© superlattices. The dislocations, forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers, bring about spatial modulation of the interlayer distance, generating effective potentials that promote the emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer-breathing modes inside perfect dislocations. For parallel MX$_2$ bilayers, perfect dislocations host multiple quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains. In contrast, antiparallel bilayers exhibit only a single quasi-bound band arising for orientations close to the edge-dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</p>

            <h2>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Jordao, Qi Huang, Swarnabha Chattaraj, Siyuan Lu, Jiefei Zhang, Anupam Madhukar</p>
            <p>On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM finding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared wavelength range.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soichiro Fukuoka, Le Duc Anh, Masayuki Ishida, Tomoki Hotta, Takahiro Chiba, Yohei Kota, Masaaki Tanaka</p>
            <p>The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Hao Lee, Steven E. Zeltmann, Dasol Yoon, Desheng Ma, David A. Muller</p>
            <p>Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</p>

            <p>Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.</p>

            <h2>Canonical Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaldo Spalvieri</p>
            <p>In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.</p>

            <h2>Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c \equiv H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis described by the $N$-spin Curie-Weiss model where $N^{-1/2}\sim\sigma$. Our work provides a panoramic view of finite-time scalings of the hysteresis phenomenon, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Ontological differentiation as a measure of semantic accuracy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Garcia-Cuadrillero, Fabio Revuelta, Jose Angel Capitan</p>
            <p>Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across ~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sameer Kumar, Niels de Graaf Sousa, Amin Doostmohammadi</p>
            <p>The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.</p>

            <p>In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.</p>

            <p>Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p>We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</p>
