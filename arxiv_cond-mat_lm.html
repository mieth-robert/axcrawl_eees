            <h2>Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Zoryansky, P. Zinoviev, Yu. Semerenko</p>
            <p>Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</p>

            <h2>Vestigial Order from an Excitonic Mother State in Kagome Superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Ingham, Ronny Thomale, Harley D. Scammell</p>
            <p>Alongside high-temperature charge order and superconductivity, kagome metals exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking and nematicity which appear to depend strongly on external perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields, posing a fundamental challenge for conceptual reconciliation. We develop a theory of vestigial order descending from an excitonic mother state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs), which develops around $T_* \approx 40$ K. The application of external fields stabilises a subset of the phase-melted order parameter manifold, referred to as a vestigial state, producing a symmetry-breaking response which depends on the applied probe. Our theory reproduces the observations of piezomagnetism, electric magnetic chiral anisotropy, absence of Kerr rotation, unusual elastoresistance response, and superconducting diode effect. Our proposed excitonic mother state accounts for probe-dependent symmetry breaking patterns without fine-tuning, and predicts additional signatures accessible through optical spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>Collective neutral excitations as sensitive probe for the quality of 2D charge carrier systems in ultra-pure GaAs quantum wells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ursula Wurstbauer, Michael J. Manfra, Ken W. West, Loren N. Pfeiffer</p>
            <p>Ultra-clean low-dimensional interacting charge carrier systems are the basis to explore correlated states and phases. We report the observation of very narrow collective intersubband excitations (ISBE) of 2D electron systems (2DESs) with ultra-high mobilities in high quality GaAs quantum well structures. These findings from resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experiments are used as tools for exploration of links between transport mobility and collective electron behavior in 2DES of high perfection. We find that the linewidths of collective ISBE modes can be very narrow with values smaller than 80{\mu}eV. Comparison of ISBE measurements from several high-mobility samples exhibits a variation in linewidth of more than a factor of two. There is, however, a surprising lack of direct correlation between ISBE linewidth with mobility in the range 15x10^6 cm^2/Vs<{\mu}<24x10^6 cm^2/Vs. ISBE by RILS are discussed as a sensitive probe to characterize the interacting electron systems for fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) studies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Engineering of Dual Hall Effects in 2D Antiferromagnetic Bilayers via Interlayer Magnetic Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenning Sun, Tao Wang, Hao Jin, Xinru Li, Yadong Wei, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>The interplay between quantum geometry and magnetic order offers a novel strategy for designing next-generation nanodevices. Here, we demonstrate that interlayer magnetic coupling in two-dimensional (2D) CoPSe3 bilayers enables precise control over quantum geometric mechanisms, unlocking dual intrinsic Hall effects. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the altermagnetic (AM) phase exhibits a giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) ($\sigma_{xy}$ is approximately 46 S/cm) driven by Berry curvature localized at generic k-points, while the PT-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase hosts an intrinsic second-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE) ($\chi_{xyy}$ is approximately 160 ${\mu}$S/V) originating from quantum metric accumulation at high-symmetry k-points. By tuning interlayer magnetic couplings, we achieve reversible switching between these phases, leveraging their distinct band structures and symmetry constraints. The Neel-vector-dependent AHE in the AM phase and the symmetry-protected NAHE in the AFM phase highlight quantum geometry as a versatile tool for manipulating transport properties. Our work establishes 2D antiferromagnets as a promising platform for multifunctional device architectures, bridging linear and nonlinear magnetoelectric responses through tailored quantum geometric engineering.</p>

            <h2>Observation of giant nonlinear valley Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan He, Min Zhang, Jin Cao, Jingru Li, Hao Liu, Jinfeng Zhai, Ruibo Wang, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang, Jian Shen</p>
            <p>The valley Hall effect (VHE) holds great promise for valleytronic applications by leveraging the valley degree of freedom. To date, research on VHE has focused on its linear response to an applied current, leaving nonlinear valley responses undetected and nonlinear valleytronic devices undeveloped. Here, we report the experimental observation of a nonlinear VHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, evidenced by the generation of second-harmonic nonlocal voltages under AC currents. Remarkably, the nonlinear VHE has magnitude surpassing the linear VHE and is highly tunable via a gate voltage, which exhibits a pair of opposite peaks on the two sides of a Dirac gap. The nonlinear signal shows quadratic scaling with driving current and quartic scaling with local resistance, setting it apart from the linear counterpart. These experimental features are consistent with the theoretical picture of nonlocal transport mediated by nonlinear VHE and linear inverse VHE. We further reveal a nonlinear inverse VHE by observing the third- and fourth-harmonic nonlocal voltages. The nonlinear VHE provides a novel mechanism for valley manipulation and enables a novel valleytronic device, the valley rectifier, that converts AC charge current into DC valley current.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-driven superconductivity in the topological insulator GeBi4Te7</h2>

            <p>The van der Waals, pseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or Bi; Ch = Te, Se) have recently been reported to host a vast landscape of topological phases of matter, including the quantum anomalous Hall state and topological axion state with quantized magnetoelectric effect. A subgroup in this series, like MnSb4Te7 and GeSb4Te7, can be driven to a superconducting state by applying a physical pressure, making them viable candidates to realize so-called topological superconductivity. However, the role of magnetic fluctuations in this pressure-induced superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we report the pressure-induced multiple superconducting phases in the nonmagnetic GeBi4Te7, accompanied by corresponding structural transitions evidenced from the high-pressure Raman scattering. In comparison with other members in this family, we find the superconducting transition temperature of the nonmagnetic subgroup is significantly higher than their magnetic homologues, possibly hinting at the detrimental role played by the magnetic fluctuations in the superconductivity formation, at least in this pseudo-binary chalcogenide family.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Dual-Iron Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Reduction: A Comprehensive Study on Structural and Electronic Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Zhang, Wenxin Ma, Jiajie Qiao, Xiaoliang Wu, Shaowen Yu, Weiye Hou, Xiang Huang, Rubin Huo, Hongbo Wu, Yusong Tu</p>
            <p>The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an efficient and green pathway for ammonia synthesis, plays a crucial role in achieving on-demand ammonia production. This study proposes a novel design concept based on dual-iron atomic sites and nitrogen-boron co-doped graphene catalysts, exploring their high efficiency in NRR. By modulating the N and B co-doped ratios, we found that Fe2N3B@G catalyst exhibited significant activity in the adsorption and hydrogenation of N2 molecules, especially with the lowest free energy (0.32 eV) on NRR distal pathway, showing its excellent nitrogen activation capability and NRR performance. The computed electron localization function, crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, electrostatic potential map revealed that the improved NRR kinetics of Fe2N3B@G catalyst derived by N3B co-doping induced optimization of Fe-Fe electronic environment, regulation of Fe-N bond strength, and the continuous electronic support during the N2 breakage and hydrogenation. In particular, machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations were employed to verify the high activity of Fe2N3B@G catalyst in NRR, which reveal that Fe2N3B@G effectively regulates the electron density of Fe-N bond, ensuring the smooth generation and desorption of NH3 molecules and avoiding the competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, the determined higher HER overpotential of Fe2N3B@G catalyst can effectively inhibit the HER and enhance the selectivity toward NRR. In addition, Fe2N3B@G catalyst also showed good thermal stability by MD simulations up to 500 K, offering its feasibility in practical applications. This study demonstrates the superior performance of Fe2N3B@G in nitrogen reduction catalysis, and provides theoretical guidance for atomic catalyst design by the co-doping strategy and in-deep electronic environment modulation.</p>

            <h2>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan Xavier, Iacopo Carusotto, Titas Chanda, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Electric-Field Control of Magnetic Skyrmion Chirality in a Centrosymmetric 2D van der Waals Magnet</h2>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinichi Sunami, Vijay P. Singh, Erik Rydow, Abel Beregi, En Chang, Ludwig Mathey, Christopher J. Foot</p>
            <p>We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.</p>

            <h2>Magnon Spectra of Cuprates beyond Spin Wave Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiahui Bao, Matthias Gohlke, Jeffrey G. Rau, Nic Shannon</p>
            <p>The usual starting point for understanding magnons in cuprate antiferromagnets such as La$_2$CuO$_4$ is a spin model incorporating cyclic exchange, which descends from a one-band Hubbard model, and has parameters taken from fits based on non-interacting spin wave theory. Here we explore whether this provides a reliable description of experiment, using matrix product states (MPS) to calculate magnon spectra beyond spin wave theory. We find that analysis based on low orders of spin wave theory leads to systematic overestimates of exchange parameters, with corresponding errors in estimates of Hubbard $t/U$. Once these are corrected, the ''standard'' model provides a good account of magnon dispersion and lineshape in La$_2$CuO$_4$, but fails to fully capture the continuum observed at high energies. The extension of this analysis to CaCuO$_2$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishing between topological Majorana and trivial zero modes via transport and shot noise study in an altermagnet heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debashish Mondal, Amartya Pal, Arijit Saha, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.</p>

            <p>CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term. All these results point to a possible ground state of quantum spin liquid.</p>

            <h2>Optical control of electrons in a Floquet topological insulator</h2>

            <p>Light-dressed materials hold enormous potential for generating new electronic properties. The band structure resulting from light-dressing can exhibit starkly different quantum and topological phenomena. So far, optical control of charge within a light-dressed band structure has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate optical control of electrons in light-dressed graphene. By focusing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses at 1550 nm on monolayer graphene, we generate a Floquet topological insulator (FTI). With a phase-locked second harmonic field, we dynamically control electrons in this FTI state. For the first time, we observe photocurrent circular dichroism, the all-optical anomalous Hall effect, and FTI valley-polarized currents. The photocurrents show strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity, opening the door to ultrafast control within topologically protected electronics (topotronics), spectroscopy, and attosecond physics in novel quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</p>

            <h2>A General Neural Network Potential for Energetic Materials with C, H, N, and O elements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjie Wen, Jiahe Han, Wenjuan Li, Xiaoya Chang, Qingzhao Chu, Dongping Chen</p>
            <p>The discovery and optimization of high-energy materials (HEMs) are constrained by the prohibitive computational expense and prolonged development cycles inherent in conventional approaches. In this work, we develop a general neural network potential (NNP) that efficiently predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs composed of C, H, N, and O. Our framework leverages pre-trained NNP models, fine-tuned using transfer learning on energy and force data derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy enables rapid adaptation across 20 different HEM systems while maintaining DFT-level accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of this work is the ability of NNP model to capture the chemical activity space of HEMs, accurately describe the key atomic interactions and reaction mechanisms during thermal decomposition. The general NNP model has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and validated with experimental data for various HEM structures. Results show that the NNP model accurately predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs by effectively describing their chemical activity space. Compared to traditional force fields, it offers superior DFT-level accuracy and generalization across both microscopic and macroscopic properties, reducing the computational and experimental costs. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design and development of HEMs and proposes a promising framework for integrating DFT, machine learning, and experimental methods in materials research.

            <p>Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for such a qubit. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.</p>

            <p>We report the discovery of a series of non-equilibrium magic angles at which isolated topological flat quasienergy bands form in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene under circularly polarized light. These non-equilibrium magic angles can be traced back to specific static twist angles where the bandwidth reaches a minimum \textit{without} the formation of isolated flat bands. We refer to these as minimum twist angles, in contrast to the magic angles observed in twisted bilayer graphene. We show that an applied displacement field can further flatten the optically induced topological flat bands accompanied by larger non-equilibrium magic angles. The discovery of these electrically tunable topological flat quasienergy bands is expected to open up a new avenue of exploring exotic Floquet-driven phenomena in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>Spin-triplet superconductivity is a key platform for topological quantum computing, yet its experimental realization and control in solid-state materials remain a significant challenge. For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging $p$-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a new pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.</p>

Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that directly confirms the theoretical predictions. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phases for Finite-Temperature Gases of Bosonic Polar Molecules Shielded by Dual Microwaves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Zhang, Kun Chen, Su Yi, Tao Shi</p>
            <p>We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of polar molecules shielded by dual microwave fields using the path integral Monte Carlo method combined with the worm algorithm. We determine the critical temperature $T_c$ for Bose-Einstein condensations (BECs) and identify two distinct phases below $T_c$: the expanding gas (EG) phase and the self-bound gas (SBG) phase. We further analyze the temperature and interaction-strength dependence of the condensate and superfluid fractions. Notably, in contrast to dilute atomic BECs, the SBG phase displays a low condensate fraction and a high superfluid fraction, resembling the behavior of strongly correlated $^4$He superfluids. These significant many-body correlations arise from the interplay between long-range dipole-dipole interactions and the short-range shielding potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the gas provides a characteristic geometric signature to accurately determine the EG-to-SBG transition, robust against external trapping potentials. Our findings provide unbiased and numerically exact results to guide upcoming experiments with polar molecules.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons in III-V semiconductor microcavities offer a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling advancements in photonic applications and quantum simulation. Here, two novel fabrication techniques designed to overcome the limitations of traditional photonic confinement methods are introduced. The two distinct approaches - etch-and-oversputter (EnS) and deposit-and-oversputter (DnS) - are both based on a structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavity, leading to a deep and highly controllable spatially dependent potential. By utilizing an all-dielectric sputtered top mirror, sample iteration time, workflow complexity and expense is reduced while increasing the overall yield compared to methods such as deep ion etching. Employing a Kagome lattice and its flatband and Dirac-cone dispersions as a benchmark, high quality optical band structures are achieved, which so far have not been realized using a deep etching approach. To highlight the precise control over the lattice couplings, the eigenmodes in a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice are studied and polariton lasing from a zerodimensional corner mode is observed. This confirms the effectiveness of the methods presented in this paper for generating well-controlled, deep and homogeneous trapping potentials. These pave the way for fabricating intricate lattices, such as higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum emitters utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs from two interacting quantum emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Juan-Delgado, Geza Giedke, Javier Aizpurua, Ruben Esteban</p>
            <p>Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.</p>

            <h2>Spin-split flat bands at the band edge and two-dimensional hole gases towards quantum Hall effect in altermagnetic CoF$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic phase is recently found as a new magnetic phase in addition to the conventional collinear spin orders, and great efforts have been made to explore novel effects and potential applications in such materials. Here, we show that there are robust altermagnetic spin-split flat bands near the valence band edge in rutile CoF$_2$ through first-principles investigation. It is uncovered that the magnetic moments can remain in the z axis because of the magnetocrystalline energy due to the spin-orbits coupling and the spin orientation can be made more stable by magnetic field applied in the xy plane. We describe the spin-dependent band structure (including the flat bands) near the Fermi level by a spin-resolved effective low-energy model, and reveal that they can host spin-dependent two-dimensional hole gases. Importantly, we find spin-dependent quantum Hall effects in the two-dimensional hole gases by applying the magnetic field in the xy plane, and then explore the dependence of Hall conductivity and Hall resistance on the Fermi level and the magnetic field (both magnitude and direction) and related longitudinal carrier transport properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. F. Peterson, Y. U. Idzerda</p>
            <p>Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.</p>

            <p>Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI).</p>

            <p>Scattering by a short-range potential with time-periodic interaction strength is investigated with a Floquet-scattering theory. Sharp resonances occur, at which the s-wave scattering length can be tuned to large positive and negative values. We show that the shape of these resonances is described by a simple formula, and find that both resonance position and prefactor can be altered by the driving strength. Our approach allows to identify the physical origin of the scattering resonances as Floquet bound states with positive energies, which are dynamically created by the drive. This insight is valuable for a detailed analysis and uncovers a general resource for enhanced or reduced scattering in Floquet systems.</p>

            <p>Electrical control of quantum magnetic states is essential in spintronic science. Initial studies on the ferromagnetic state control were extended to collinear antiferromagnets and, more recently, noncollinear antiferromagnets. However, electrical control mechanisms of such exotic magnetic states remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first experimental and theoretical example of the current control of helical antiferromagnets, arising from the competition between collinear antiferromagnetic exchange and interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in new van-der-Waals (vdW) material Ni1/3NbS2. Due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry, an in-plane current generates spin-orbit torque that, in turn, interacts directly with the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our theoretical analyses indicate that a weak ferromagnetic order coexists due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, mediating the spin-orbit torque to collectively rotate the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our Ni1/3NbS2 nanodevice experiments produce current-dependent resistance change consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work widens our understanding of the electrical control of helical antiferromagnets and promotes vdW quantum magnets as interesting material platforms for electrical control.</p>

Pressure-controlled interlayer coupling manifests in enhanced energy-level anti-crossings and oscillator strength redistribution, with Stark shift analysis revealing a characteristic dipole moment reduction of 11%. Notably, the hybridization strength between the intra- and interlayer excitons triples from $\sim$10 meV to above $\sim$30 meV, exhibiting a near-linear scaling of 3.5$\pm$0.2 meV/GPa. Spectral density simulations resolve four distinct components, i.e., intralayer ground/excited and interlayer ground/excited excitons, with their relative weights transitioning from one component dominant to strongly hybridized at higher pressures. Our findings highlight the potential for controlling excitonic properties and engineering novel optoelectronic devices through interlayer compression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Adhikari, Aksaj Bharatwaj, Priya Johari</p>
            <p>Dimensionality engineering in A$_{n+1}$B$_n$X$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite phases has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance optoelectronic properties. These properties are highly material-dependent, requiring detailed exploration of electronic, optical, excitonic, transport, and polaronic characteristics. However, the absence of comprehensive studies continues to impede the rational design of high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the excitonic and polaronic effects in A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) RP phases, examining their relative stability and optoelectronic properties using several first-principles based methodologies within the framework of density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE). Our study suggests that these compounds are mechanically stable and feature G$_0$W$_0$@PBE bandgaps ranging from 1.43 to 2.14 eV, which are smaller than those of their bulk counterparts. BSE and model-BSE (mBSE) calculations indicate that these RP phases display notable optical anisotropy, with the exciton binding energy decreasing as the thickness of the perovskite layer increases. In addition, intermediate to strong carrier-phonon scattering is observed in these compounds, confirmed through the Fröhlich mechanism near room temperature. Using the Feynman polaron model, the polaron parameters of these RP phases are also computed, and it is found that charge-separated polaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, a significant increase in electron mobilities is observed in RP phases compared to their bulk counterparts. Overall, the insights gained from this study will enable the rational design of layered perovskite phases for applications in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>We consider a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) inside an optical cavity and two crossed coherent pump fields. We determine the phase boundary separating the normal superfluid phase and the superradiance phase, perturbatively. In the regime of negative cavity detuning, we map out the phase diagrams both for an attractive and a repulsive optical lattice. It turns out that the situation is quite different in two cases. Specifically, in the case of attractive lattice, if a system is in the superradiant phase with one pump laser, adding another pump does not drive the system out of the superradiance phase. While for the repulsive lattice, increasing another pump potential have suppressive effects on the superradiance. We also find that, in the case of attractive lattice, equally increasing two pump lattice potentials can induce a transition from the normal phase to the superradiance phase. In stark contrast, for the repulsive lattice, the system will remain in the normal phase as the pump depths are tuned within a wide range, independent of the cavity detuning and the decay rate.</p>

            <p>Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin D. Spataru, Wei Pan, Alexander Cerjan</p>
            <p>A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is increased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.</p>

            <p>In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Duranthon, L. Zdeborová</p>
            <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</p>

            <p>The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</p>

            <h2>Tail-induced equilibration in long-range interacting quantum lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Han Li</p>
            <p>We examine the relation between inter-particle interactions and real-time equilibration in one-dimensional lattice systems with hard-core constraints. Focusing on the roles of interactions, our results demonstrate that in the presence of interaction tails, any power-law exponent (including the limit ones) can encode the random particle configurations to the Hamiltonian, leaving the latter characterized by random matrices. Through an experimental-accessible setup using dipolar-interacting particles in optical lattices, the quenched relaxations are demonstrated resulting in equilibrium, and the relation between eigenstate thermalization is confirmed. Our study directly unveiled the role of inter-particle interactions in quantum many-body dynamics, offering a new scheme to address equilibration in closed quantum many-body problem based on the manifesting of random particle configurations in the model Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.</p>

            <p>Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Reza Safi, Elizabeth Mathew, Rupesh Chafle, Benjamin Klusemann</p>
            <p>In this study, the role of elastic and interfacial energies in the shape evolution of T1 precipitates in Al-Cu-Li alloys is investigated using phase-field modeling. We employ a formulation considering the stoichiometric nature of the precipitate phase explicitly, including coupled equation systems for various order parameters. Inputs such as elastic properties are derived from DFT calculations, while chemical potentials are obtained from CALPHAD databases. This methodology provides a framework that is consistent with the derived chemical potentials to study the interplay of thermodynamic, kinetic, and elastic effects on T1 precipitate evolution in Al-Cu-Li alloys. It is shown that diffusion-controlled lengthening and interface-controlled thickening are important mechanisms to describe the growth of T1 precipitates. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the precipitate shape is significantly influenced by the anisotropy in interfacial energy and linear reaction rate, however, elastic effects only play a minor role.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Cluster Continuity and Dynamics in Time-Series Data: Application to Chromatin Polymer Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Nakanishi, Koji Hukushima</p>
            <p>This study presents an enhanced method for analyzing cluster dynamics, with a particular focus on tracking clusters' continuity over time using time-series data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposed method was applied to spatio-temporal cluster data obtained from a non-equilibrium MD simulation of a chromatin polymer model. In this model, clusters are formed on the polymer by binding molecules that stochastically and temporarily bind to the polymer segments at finite rates. Our analysis successfully tracked the dynamics of clusters, including merging and splitting events, and revealed that clusters exhibit a percolation transition in both spatial and temporal domains. This suggests that clusters in the chromatin polymer model can persist even under finite rates of attractive interactions, demonstrating that the method can capture complex cluster dynamics over time.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogen bond-driven interactions between chitosan and biobased surfactants: A study of bulk behavior and surface adsorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana Puente-Santamaria, Josselyn N. Molina-Basurto, Eva Gerardin, Francisco Ortega, Ramon G. Rubio, Eduardo Guzman</p>
            <p>This study explores the hydrogen bond-mediated association between chitosan (CHI) and alkyl polyglucoside (APG), a bio-based surfactant, in acidic conditions with varying ionic strengths. Unlike conventional polyelectrolyte-surfactant interactions that depend on electrostatic forces, the association in this system relies purely on non-ionic interactions. Using UV visible spectroscopy, phase diagrams, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the bulk phase behavior and adsorption characteristics of CHI-APG mixtures on negatively charged surfaces was studied. Results demonstrate that APG concentration controls the phase behavior, with moderate levels inducing coacervate formation, while higher ionic strengths promote this coacervation through enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions. This shift leads to the formation of a phase separated morphology, with micronsized coacervate droplets observable in solution. Zeta potential measurements suggest that these droplets adopt a core shell structure, characterized by a hydrophobic core due to the surfactant s alkyl chains and a hydrophilic shell formed by chitosan. Additionally, the coacervation process significantly enhances the adsorption of CHI APG complexes onto solid substrates, a feature with potential applications in targeted delivery and controlled release systems. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the design of bio-based, sustainable formulations and expands the understanding of hydrogen bond-driven, nonelectrostatic coacervation, relevant for applications in cosmetics, biomedical coatings, and environmentally friendly materials.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of Sn intercalation of the buffer layer on SiC was investigated with a frozen-in diffusion front using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. The technique allows to laterally distinguish between intercalated regions and the pristine buffer layer. Comparing topography features with the surface potential on the mesoscopic scale confirms that surface steps act as transport barriers. The results show a distinct pin hole mechanism for the material flow from terrace to terrace of the vicinal substrate surface. Nucleation and the formation of tin intercalated phase on terraces happen at steps. This results in a mesoscopic growth against the macroscopic diffusion direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktoria Noel, Thomas Gasenzer, Kirill Boguslavski</p>
            <p>We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</p>

            <h2>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D. Woods</p>
            <p>The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Impact of charge transfer excitons on unidirectional exciton transport in lateral TMD heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto Rosati, Sai Shradha, Julian Picker, Andrey Turchanin, Bernhard Urbaszek, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>Lateral heterostructures built of monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by a thin 1D interface exhibiting a large energy offset. Recently, the formation of spatially separated charge-transfer (CT) excitons at the interface has been demonstrated. The technologically important exciton propagation across the interface and the impact of CT excitons has remained in the dark so far. In this work, we microscopically investigate the spatiotemporal exciton dynamics in the exemplary hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ lateral heterostructure and reveal a highly interesting interplay of energy offset-driven unidirectional exciton drift across the interface and efficient capture into energetically lower CT excitons at the interface. This interplay triggers a counterintuitive thermal control of exciton transport with a less efficient propagation at lower temperatures - opposite to the behavior in conventional semiconductors. We predict clear signatures of this intriguing exciton propagation both in far- and near-field photoluminescence experiments. Our results present an important step toward a microscopic understanding of the technologically relevant unidirectional exciton transport in lateral heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>The "double" square-root law: Evidence for the mechanical origin of market impact using Tokyo Stock Exchange data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Maitrier, Grégoire Loeper, Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</p>
            <p>Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.</p>

            <h2>Determination of Mid-Infrared Refractive Indices of Superconducting Thin Films Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dip Joti Paul, Tony X. Zhou, Karl K. Berggren</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of the thin films from FTIR measurements, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent the dielectric functions of the films and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit these oscillator parameters, minimizing the error between the measured FTIR spectra and the simulated spectra calculated using the dielectric functions of the films. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive index values extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For further validation, we calculated the sheet resistance of the films from their extracted Drude oscillator parameters and compared with the experimental values. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.</p>

            <p>Depending on environmental conditions, lightweight soft robots can exhibit various modes of locomotion that are difficult to model. As a result, optimizing their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we study underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. Since soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using physical robots competing to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including several hundred percent increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Kang Sun, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model when an overcrossings and undercrossing coincides. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by swap gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Lourens, Ilya Sinayskiy, Johannes N. Kriel, Francesco Petruccione</p>
            <p>We introduce a method that generates ground state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for local observables and correlation functions. We also point out an interesting connection between this ansatz and a well-studied sequence in analytical number theory and the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</p>

            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Mohammad Mirzaei</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of fracture toughness under complex loading conditions, like mixed mode I/II, is essential for reliable failure assessment. This paper aims to develop a machine learning framework for predicting fracture toughness and crack initiation angles by directly utilizing stress, strain, or displacement distributions represented by selected nodes as input features. Validation is conducted using experimental data across various mode mixities and specimen geometries for brittle materials. Among stress, strain, and displacement fields, it is shown that the stress-based features, when paired with Multilayer Perceptron models, achieve high predictive accuracy with R2 scores exceeding 0.86 for fracture load predictions and 0.94 for angle predictions. A comparison with the Theory of Critical Distances (Generalized Maximum Tangential Stress) demonstrates the high accuracy of the framework. Furthermore, the impact of input parameter selections is studied, and it is demonstrated that advanced feature selection algorithms enable the framework to handle different ranges and densities of the representing field. The framework's performance was further validated for datasets with a limited number of data points and restricted mode mixities, where it maintained high accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally efficient and practical, and it operates without any supplementary post-processing steps, such as stress intensity factor calculations.</p>

            <p>Life science research has largely benefited from the use of nanoparticles (NPs), yet fundamental issues such as colloidal stability and control over NP size and shape affect NP properties and functions in biomedical applications. Here we show that including capping agents directly into zinc oxide (ZnO) NP synthesis can lead to better control of these properties and their enhanced functionality. A systematic study of the influence capping agents has on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO NP synthesized using the microwave (MW)-assisted polyol method is presented. Primary NP size (10-20 nm) was controlled by zinc precursor concentration, and NP shape was influenced by capping agent type. Capping agents enabled control over the surface charge and water interaction properties of ZnO for further investigations involving bacteria. The superior antibacterial effect was observed using positively charged, hydrophilic HMTA-capped ZnO, yet negatively charged hydrophobic OA-capped ZnO still exhibited an antibacterial effect. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms, and we discuss these differences with particular reference to the specific surface area of ZnO, and how this is key to bacteria-nanoparticle interactions. Appropriate selection of capping agents is crucial for the synthesis of potent ZnO NPs intended for antibacterial applications, specifically for combating resistance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Bianchi, Marco Lenci, Françoise Pène</p>
            <p>We introduce a continuous-time random walk model on an infinite multilayer structure inspired by transportation networks. Each layer is a copy of $\mathbb{R}^d$, indexed by a non-negative integer. A walker moves within a layer by means of an inertial displacement whose speed is a deterministic function of the layer index and whose direction and duration are random, but with a timescale that depends on the layer. After each inertial displacement, the walker may randomly shift level, up or down, independently of its past. The multilayer structure is hierarchical, in the sense that the speed is a nondecreasing function of the layer index. Our primary focus is on the diffusive properties of the system. Under a natural condition on the parameters of the model, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the $\mathbb{R}^d$-coordinate of the process. By contrast, in a class of examples where this condition is violated, we are able to determine the correct scaling of the process while proving that no limit theorem holds.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals can emerge from Dirac semimetals when the time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetries are broken. Recently, it has been proposed based on the Floquet theory that Dirac semimetals can be converted into Weyl semimetals even by shining circularly polarized light (CPL). Here we have investigated the possibility of such a Dirac-Weyl conversion by measuring the CPL-induced anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a massive 3D Dirac semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ in the paramagnetic phase using ultrafast mid-infrared pump-terahertz Faraday rotation probe spectroscopy. We find that the field-strength and driving frequency dependence of the observed AHC is well accounted for by CPL-induced nonzero Berry curvature associated with the splitting of the Dirac bands as predicted by the Floquet theory. The estimated splitting of the Dirac bands reaches about 60 % of the mass gap and the calculated CPL-induced AHC quantitatively reproduces the experimental observation, demonstrating a promising route toward the realization of Floquet-Weyl states from massive Dirac semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear breathers with crystalline symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Schindler, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wladimir A. Benalcazar</p>
            <p>Nonlinear lattice models can support "discrete breather" excitations that stay localized in space for all time. By contrast, the localized Wannier states of linear lattice models are dynamically unstable. Nevertheless, symmetric and exponentially localized Wannier states are a central tool in the classification of band structures with crystalline symmetries. Moreover, the quantized transport observed in nonlinear Thouless pumps relies on the fact that -- at least in a specific model -- discrete breathers recover Wannier states in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the correspondence between nonlinear breathers and exponentially localised Wannier states for a family of discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations with crystalline symmetries. We develop a formalism to analytically predict the breathers' spectrum, center of mass and symmetry data, and apply this to nonlinear generalizations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and the breathing kagome lattice.</p>

            <h2>Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si semiconductors for photovoltaic applications: Calculations based on density-functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the electronic and optical properties, as well as photovoltaic (PV) performance parameters for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using density-functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based methods. The band-gap for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) is found to be in the range of 0.25-0.6 (0.57-0.96) eV when PBE, PBEsol and mBJ functionals are used. In the independent-particle approximation (IPA), the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function show maximum values of 50 (16.3) at 2.6 (1.0) eV and 61 (16.2) at $\sim$3.24 (3.4) eV, respectively. Within BSE, these respective values change to 59 (17) at 2.5 (0.86) eV and 65 (16.6) at 2.68 (3.1) eV. The excitonic effect is found to be crucial in understanding the experimental optical spectra of Mg$_{2}$Si. However, this effect is relatively weaker in Ca$_{2}$Si. Present study highlights the importance of different levels of theoretical approximations for obtaining the optical spectroscopy data of silicides with a high level of accuracy. Finally, we have evaluated PV efficiency by using spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) calculation. On the top of radiative recombination, we have also incorporated non-radiative carrier recombination at a defect trap state via Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) mechanism to evaluate the efficiency. Among the studied defects, the interstitial Mg (Si) is identified as the most stable in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) and this provides SRH lifetime of 2 $\mu s$ (11.3 $ms$). The estimated maximum SLME using BSE absorption spectrum is 1.3 (31.2)\%, which decreases to 1.2 (28.5)\% due to SRH recombination. The present study suggests that Ca$_{2}$Si (Mg$_{2}$Si) is a potential candidate for single-junction (bottom cell in multi-junction) thin-film PV devices.</p>

            <h2>Thermopower probing emergent local moments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h2>

            <p>Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) have revealed the formation of flatbands, suggesting that correlation effects are likely to dominate in this system. Yet, a global transport measurement showing distinct signatures of strong correlations like local moments arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower as a sensitive global transport probe for measuring entropy, we unveil the presence of emergent local moments through their impact on entropy. Remarkably, in addition to sign changes at the Dirac point ($\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu = \pm 4$), the thermopower of MATBLG demonstrates additional sign changes at the location, $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$, which do not vary with temperature from $5K$ to $\sim 60K$. This is in contrast to sensitive temperature-dependent crossing points seen in our study on twisted bilayer graphene devices with weaker correlations. Further, we have investigated the effect of magnetic field ($B$) on the thermopower, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$. Our results show a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, that is consistent with suppression seen in the layered oxide due to the partial polarization of the spin entropy. The observed robust crossing points, together with suppression in a magnetic field, cannot be explained solely from the contributions of band fermions; instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the entropy of the emergent localized moments of a strongly correlated flatband.</p>

            <h2>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohao Li, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moiré bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moiré band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haruki Hayano, Akira Furukawa</p>
            <p>We explore the mechanism underlying the anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions through direct hydrodynamic simulations. Puller-type swimmers generate contractile flow fields along their swimming direction, leading to hydrodynamic interactions that cause the swimmers to align vertically. Our simulations reveal that this alignment effect, along with the resultant orientational order of swimming motion, becomes particularly pronounced near boundary walls, where local swimmer density is amplified, predominantly controlling the overall swimming dynamics and rheological properties of the suspension. These findings contrast with our previous simulations of pusher-type swimmers, which hydrodynamically interact through extensile flow fields, whereby they exhibit weak orientational order in the bulk region, which primarily determines their steady-state properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the steady-state behavior near the walls is strongly influenced by the aspect ratio of the microswimmers and the degree of confinement between the walls. Our results highlight the crucial role of microswimmer characteristics, such as shape and swimming mechanisms, in determining the rheological properties of active suspensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kotaro Ikeda, Tomoya Uda, Daisuke Okanohara, Sosuke Ito</p>
            <p>We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide a quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models with different noise schedules and the different data. We numerically discuss our results for the optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also show the inaccurate data generation due to the non-conservative force, and the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</p>

            <p>The diode effect in superconducting materials has been actively investigated in recent years. Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform to observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the possibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with controllable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.</p>

            <h2>Short-range order and hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov</p>
            <p>In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</p>

            <p>We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</p>

            <h2>Post-Transition Metal Sn-Based Chalcogenide Perovskites: A Promising Lead-Free and Transition Metal Alternative for Stable, High-Performance Photovoltaics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Adhikari, Sankhasuvra Das, Priya Johari</p>
            <p>Chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their stability, non-toxicity, small bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, and defect tolerance. Although transition metal-based CPs, particularly those incorporating Zr and Hf, have been well-studied, they often exhibit higher bandgaps, lower charge carrier mobility, and reduced efficiency compared to lead-based halide perovskites (HPs). Tin (Sn), a post-transition metal with a similar oxidation state (+4) as Zr and Hf in ABX$_{3}$ structures but with different valence characteristics, remains underexplored in CPs. Given the influence of valence states on material properties, Sn-based CPs are of great interest. This study employs density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE) to investigate a series of distorted Sn-based CPs (ASnX$_{3}$, A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). Our results demonstrate that these perovskites are mechanically stable and exhibit lower direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgaps (0.79-1.50 eV) compared to their Zr- and Hf-based counterparts. Analysis of carrier-phonon interactions reveals that the charge-separated polaronic state is less stable than the bound exciton state in these materials. Additionally, polaron-assisted charge carrier mobilities for electrons (21.33-416.02 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) and holes (7.02-260.69 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) are comparable to or higher than those in lead-based HPs and significantly exceed those of Zr- and Hf-based CPs, owing to reduced carrier-phonon coupling. The estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (24.2%-31.2%)-confirmed through perovskite solar cell (PSC) simulations using SCAPS-1D software-indicates that these materials are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. V. Dmitriev, V. Ya. Krivnov</p>
            <p>The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.</p>

            <p>A key hallmark of quantum Hall physics is the existence of topological chiral states at the system boundary. Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of ``synthetic dimension'' in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects. Our work opens the way for future experiments in topological physics with synthetic dimensions, while also providing new ways to manipulate and control highly-excited trap states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daehyeon An, Se Kwon Kim</p>
            <p>The Nernst effect of the magnon orbital moment is theoretically investigated in a honeycomb ferromagnet, whose Hamiltonian contains the Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, the Kitaev, and the Zeeman interactions. More specifically, we obtain the magnon band structure, the Berry curvature, the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature, and the magnon orbital moment Nernst conductivity (MOMNC) for the Hamiltonian within the linear spin-wave theory in the polarized phase. We found the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature is largely independent of the sign of the Chern number of the band. For an experimental proposal, we estimate MOMNC of $\mathrm{CrI}_{3}$ for the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-Zeeman model and Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-Zeeman model for a perpendicular external magnetic field. We found that certain Kitaev materials provide us with a broad tunability of the MOMNC through a magnetic field. We envision that our findings lead to further investigations of the novel transport properties of the magnon orbital moment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Qiang Gao, Congjun Wu</p>
            <p>We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Jeanmairet, Emmanuel Giner</p>
            <p>Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations. This paper aims to develop an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation and serves as a starting point for further development. We therefore establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start with the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm quantum and N mm classical particles and, based on this, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities, thus generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional in order to explicitly make appear the eDFT and cDFT Levy-Lieb functionals, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo, M. Dudka, M. Krasnytska, Yu. Holovatch</p>
            <p>Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

The data can come from density functional theory (DFT) calculations or classical molecular dynamics runs performed in a supercell. First, the model potential parameters, which are anharmonic force constants are extracted from the latter runs. Then, once the anharmonic model is defined, thermal conductivity and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures can be computed using lattice dynamics, Boltzmann transport theories, and a variational principle respectively. In addition, the software calculates the mechanical properties such as elastic tensor, Gruneisen parameters and the thermal expansion coefficient within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Phonons, elastic constants and thermodynamic properties results applied to the germanium crystal will be illustrated. Using the force constants as a force field, one may also perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate the combined effects of anharmonicity and defect scattering beyond perturbation theory.</p>

            <p>Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting, due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies, significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system. Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation alloys.</p>

The glass transition temperature decreases with the increasing C$_m$H$_{2m}$ chain length in the 3FmHPhF6 molecule. The tilt angle in the smectic C$_A$* phase reaches 36.5-37.5°. The selective reflection of light in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges is observed, with a strong dependence of the reflected light's wavenumber on temperature.</p>

            <h2>Linear-limit aging times of three monoalcohols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Philipp Gabriel, Jeppe C. Dyre, Tina Hecksher</p>
            <p>This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is studied by monitoring the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range following temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude, starting from states of equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and how much the Debye process is separated from the $\alpha$ process. We first demonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to utilize this fact to identify the linear-limit normalized aging relaxation functions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit aging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging relaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of the Debye and $\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols. We conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and 2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\alpha$ relaxation, not the Debye process, while no firm conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because its Debye and $\alpha$ processes are too close to be reliably distinguished.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Quantification for Misspecified Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danny Perez, Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Ivan Maliyov, Thomas D. Swinburne</p>
            <p>The use of high-dimensional regression techniques from machine learning has significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of interatomic potentials. Atomic simulations can now plausibly target quantitative predictions in a variety of settings, which has brought renewed interest in robust means to quantify uncertainties on simulation results. In many practical settings, encompassing both classical and a large class of machine learning potentials, the dominant form of uncertainty is currently not due to lack of training data but to misspecification, namely the inability of any one choice of model parameters to exactly match all ab initio training data. However, Bayesian inference, the most common formal tool used to quantify uncertainty, is known to ignore misspecification and thus significantly underestimates parameter uncertainties. Here, we employ a recent misspecification-aware regression technique to quantify parameter uncertainties, which is then propagated to a broad range of phase and defect properties in tungsten via brute force resampling or implicit differentiation. The propagated misspecification uncertainties robustly envelope errors to direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of material properties outside of the training dataset, an essential requirement for any quantitative multi-scale modeling scheme. Finally, we demonstrate application to recent foundational machine learning interatomic potentials, accurately predicting and bounding errors in MACE-MPA-0 energy predictions across the diverse materials project database. Perspectives for the approach in multiscale simulation workflows are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Jyothis, Kallol Mondal, Himanshu Mavani, V. Ravi Chandra</p>
            <p>We study the effect of magnon interactions on the spin wave spectra of the all-in-all-out phase of the pyrochlore nearest neighbour antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ($D$). The leading order corrections to spin wave energies indicate a significant renormalisation for commonly encountered strengths of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. For low values of $D$ we find a potential instability of the phase itself, indicated by the renormalisation of magnon frequencies to negative values. We have also studied the renormalized spectra in the presence of magnetic fields along three high symmetry directions of the lattice, namely the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Generically, we find that for a fixed value of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction renormalized spectra for the lowest band decrease with an increasing strength of the field. We have also analyzed the limits of the two magnon continuum and probed the possibility of magnon decay. For a range of $D$ and the field strength we identify possible parameter regimes where the decay of the higher bands of the system are kinematically allowed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Eto, Masahito Mochizuki, Shinji Watanabe</p>
            <p>Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</p>

            <p>Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</p>

            <p>In this paper, we discuss a method to calculate the topology of the rate independent single crystal yield surface for materials with arbitrary slip systems and arbitrary slip strengths. We describe the general problem, as motivated by Schmid's law, and detail the calculation of hyperplanes in deviatoric stress space, $\mathbb{D}^5$, which describe the criteria for slip on individual slip systems. We focus on finding the intersection of five linearly independent hyperplanes which represent stresses necessary to satisfy the criteria for general plastic deformation. Finally, we describe a method for calculating the inner convex hull of these intersection points, which describe the vertices of the five dimensional polytope that represents the single crystal yield surface. Our method applies to arbitrary crystal structure, allowing for an arbitrary number and type of slip systems and families, considers plastic anisotropy via inter- and intra-family strength anisotropy, and further considers strength anisotropy between slip in the positive and negative direction. We discuss the calculation and possible applications, and share a computational implementation of the calculation of the single crystal yield surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Zhang, Sarthak Gupta, Madeline A. Lancaster, J. M. Schwarz</p>
            <p>How genes affect tissue scale organization remains a longstanding biological puzzle. As experimental efforts aim to quantify gene expression, chromatin organization, cellular structure, and tissue structure, computational modeling lags behind. To address this gap, we merge a cellular-based tissue model with a nuclear model that includes a deformable lamina shell and chromatin to test multiscale hypotheses linking chromatin and tissue scales. We propose a multiscale hypothesis focusing on brain organoids to explain structural differences between brain organoids built from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and induced-pluripotent gorilla and chimpanzee cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate transition from neuroepithelial to radial glial cells includes a new intermediate state delayed in human organoids, which narrows and lengthens cells on the apical side. Experiments show that the transcription factor ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this intermediate state with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking. We postulate that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression is potentially due to chromatin reorganization in response to mechanical deformations of the nucleus. A larger critical mechanical strain triggers reorganization in human-derived stem cells, causing delayed ZEB2 upregulation compared with genetically close relatives. We test this by exploring how slightly different initial configurations of chromatin reorganize under applied strain, with greater representing less genetically-close relatives. We find that larger configuration discrepancies produce increased differences in the magnitude of chromatin displacement that rise faster than linearly yet slower than exponentially. Changes in chromatin strain and contact maps can reveal species-specific differences, aiding our understanding of how one species differs in structure from another.</p>

            <h2>Quantum time dynamics mediated by the Yang-Baxter equation and artificial neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Gulania, Yuri Alexeev, Stephen K. Gray, Bo Peng, Niranjan Govind</p>
            <p>Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Federico Garcia-Gaitan, David J. Strachan, Petr Plechac, Stephen R. Clark, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum origin of Ohm's reciprocity relation and its violation: conductivity as inverse resistivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Frangi, Sašo Grozdanov</p>
            <p>Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of conserved currents in quantum field theory, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We then elucidate how in certain special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity relation is reinstated as an emergent property of conductive and resistive transport. We also show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate the hydrodynamic macroscopic late-time transport.</p>

            <p>As an example for the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised characterization of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets, we analysed spectral data derived from five field instruments (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman), collected on 76 bedrock samples of diverse composition. These data were analysed by single- and multi- block latent variable models, based on principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). For the single-block approach, PCA and PLS models were generated; whilst hierarchical partial least squares (HPLS) regression was applied for the multi-block modelling. We also tested whether dimensionality reduction resulted in a more computationally efficient muti-block HPLS model with enhanced model interpretability and geological characterization power using the variable influence on projection (VIP) feature selection method. The results showed differences in the characterization power of the five spectrometer data sets for the bedrock samples based on their mineral composition and geological properties; moreover, some spectroscopic techniques under-performed for distinguishing samples by composition. The multi-block HPLS and its VIP-strengthened model yielded a more complete unsupervised geological aggrupation of the samples in a single parsimonious model. We conclude that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive characterization of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability. These approaches have been applied here to a geological data set, but are amenable to a broad range of applications across chemical and biomedical disciplines.</p>

            <p>Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</p>

By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</p>

            <p>The surfaces of some icy moons, such as Jupiter's moon Europa, are heavily bombarded by energetic particles that can alter the surface materials and affect the composition of its exosphere. Detection of CO2 on Europa's surface indicate that Europa's interior may be transporting freshly exposed carbon-containing material to the surface. It is unknown whether this CO2 is a product of radiation of carbon-containing precursors or whether it is present in the initial deposits. Regardless, further radiolysis by high-energy electrons or ions can sputter CO2 (and organic fragments if present) into Europa's exosphere. In this study, we investigate the radiation sputtering of CO2 and organic fragments from hydrocarbon water ice mixtures at different Europa-relevant surface temperatures to identify how its sputtering products evolve over time. This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</p>

            <p>In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>We study electromagnetic (EM) response of the excitonic insulator phase of time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Because of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM, the phase of the exciton condensate couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. Although the translational symmetry of the WSM is broken in the excitonic insulator state, the axion field is not related to the phase of the sliding exciton density wave. The axion mass is generated by the inter-band matrix elements of electron-electron interactions, and is much smaller than the gap in the single-particle spectrum. Due to the small axion mass, in the presence of a magnetic field, the axion coupling to EM fields produces giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. M. Koskamp, M. I. Katsnelson, K. J. A. Reijnders</p>
            <p>Plasmons are likely to play an important role in integrated photonic ciruits, because they strongly interact with light and can be confined to subwavelength scales. These plasmons can be guided and controlled by plasmonic waveguides, which can be created by patterning different materials or by structuring the dielectric environment. We have constructed a semi-analytical theory to describe plasmonic waveguides, and, more generally, plasmons in spatially inhomogeneous systems. Our theory employs techniques from semiclassical analysis, and is therefore applicable when the electron wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of changes in the system parameters. We obtain an effective classical Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of quantum plasmons, given by the Lindhard function with spatially varying parameters. Adding the wave-like character of the plasmons to the classical trajectories generated by this Hamiltonian, we find two different mechanisms for waveguiding. In the first case, a localized plasmonic state arises due to total internal reflection similar to photonic waveguides. The second mechanism relies on a varying dielectric environment, which locally modifies the screening of the electrons. Here, a quasi-localized state arises due to local changes in the amplitude of the plasmonic excitation. Our results provide a solid basis to understand previous numerical studies.</p>

            <h2>Formation of Frustrated Charge Density Waves in Kagome Metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</h2>

            <p>The charge density wave (CDW), a translational symmetry breaking electronic liquid, plays a pivotal role in correlated quantum materials, such as high-T$_c$ superconductors and topological semimetals. Recently, CDWs that possibly intertwine with superconductivity and magnetism are observed in various kagome metals. However, the nature of CDWs and the role of the Fermi surface (FS) topology in these materials remain an unresolved challenge. In this letter, we reveal the formation of CDWs in the newly discovered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. We observe a precursor CDW correlation that features a "yield sign"-like hollow triangle diffuse scattering pattern and nearly complete softening of a flat optical phonon band near Q$_H$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/2). The scattering intensity of the precursor CDW displays divergent behavior as decreasing temperature until T$_{CDW}$=70 K, where a competing CDW at Q$_{CDW}$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) emerges. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we image the frustrated CDW patterns that show a short phase coherence length about ~20 nm in real space. Combined with first principles calculations, our observations support frustrated lattice interactions that are modulated by the FS topology. These results shed light on the interplay between FS and CDW in quantum materials with nearly degenerate structural deformation patterns.</p>

            <h2>Orbital-excitation-dominated magnetization dissipation and quantum oscillation of Gilbert damping in Fe films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Chen, Haoran Chen, Xi Shen, Weizhao Chen, Yi Liu, Yizheng Wu, Zhe Yuan</p>
            <p>Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys, but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale polar structures are significant for understanding polarization processes in low-dimensional systems and hold potential for developing high-performance electronics. Here, we demonstrate a polar vortex superstructure arising from the reconstructed moiré patterns in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals spatially modulated charge polarization, while theoretical simulations indicate that the in-plane polarization field forms an array of polar vortices. Notably, this polar field is gate-tunable, exhibiting an unconventional gate-tunable polar sliding and screening process. Moreover, its interaction with electron correlations in twisted bilayer graphene leads to modulated correlated states. Our findings establish moiré pattern reconstruction as a powerful strategy for engineering nanoscale polar structures and emergent quantum phases in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <h2>Finite-momentum dielectric function and excitonic effects from time-dependent density-functional theory with dielectrically screened hybrid functionals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Didarul Alam, Jiuyu Sun, Carsten A. Ullrich</p>
            <p>This paper studies the performance of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for calculating the dielectric function of semiconductors and insulators at finite momentum transfer, comparing against the standard Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Specifically, we consider a recently proposed hybrid approach that mixes dielectrically screened exact exchange with a semilocal functional, and we also introduce a new hybrid functional featuring a truncated dielectric screening scheme. The computational effort of these hybrid TDDFT approaches is significantly less than that of the BSE, but they deliver comparable accuracy, as demonstrated for the semiconductors Si and GaN and the wide-band insulator LiF. This opens up possibilities for calculating exciton dispersions and electron energy loss functions efficiently and accurately for a wide range of materials.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Broken Kondo Screening and Zero-Energy Mode in the Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5</h2>

            <p>The quantum states of matter reorganize themselves in response to defects, giving rise to emergent local excitations that imprint unique characteristics of the host states. While magnetic impurities are known to generate Kondo screening in a Fermi liquid and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in a conventional superconductor, it remains unclear whether they can evoke distinct phenomena in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs), which may host an orbital-antiferromagnetic charge density wave (CDW) state and an unconventional superconducting state driven by the convergence of topology, geometric frustration and electron correlations. In this work, we visualize the local density of states induced near various types of impurities in both the CDW and superconducting phases of CsV3-xMxSb5 (M = Ta, Cr) using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe Kondo resonance states near magnetic Cr dopants. Notably, unlike in any known metal or CDW compound, the spatial pattern of Kondo screening breaks all in-plane mirror symmetries of the kagome lattice, suggesting an electronic chirality due to putative orbital loop currents. While Cooper pairs show relative insensitivity to nonmagnetic impurities, native V vacancies with weak magnetic moments induce a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the superconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling transmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of signature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change boundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent with a surface topological superconducting state. Our findings provide a new approach to exploring novel quantum states on kagome lattices.</p>

            <h2>Spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance intertwined with superconducting gap in kagome metal CsV3-xCrxSb5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichen Huang, Hui Chen, Zhongqin Zhang, Hao Zhang, Zhen Zhao, Ruwen Wang, Haitao Yang, Wei Ji, Ziqiang Wang, Hong-Jun Gao</p>
            <p>The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eeli O. Lamponen, Sofia K. Pöntys, Päivi Törmä</p>
            <p>We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Anomalous Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjan Sheoran, Pratibha Dev</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is an efficient tool for detecting the Néel vector in collinear compensated magnets with spin-split bands, known as altermagnets (AMs). Here, we establish design principles for obtaining non-zero anomalous Hall conductivity in the recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) AMs using spin and magnetic group symmetry analysis. We show that only two of the seven nontrivial spin layer groups exhibit an unconventional in-plane AHE in which the Néel vector lies within the plane of the Hall current. Through first-principles simulations on bilayers of MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe, we demonstrate the validity of our group theoretic framework for obtaining AHE with $d$ and $i$-wave altermagnetic orders, depending on the stacking of the bilayers. We find that the spin group symmetry is successful in determining the linear and cubic dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity in Néel vector space, although AHE is a relativistic effect. This work shows that the AHE in 2D AMs can probe the altermagnetic order and Néel vector reversal, thereby facilitating the miniaturization of altermagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal pronounced optical anisotropy along the $a$- and $c$-axis, as well as an unusual response associated with three-dimensional CDW order. Above $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$, there is a notable transfer of spectral weight (SW) from high to low energies, promoted by the magnetic splitting-induced shift in bands. Across the CDW transition, we observe a sudden SW transfer from low to high energies over a broad range, along with the emergence of new excitations around 1200 cm$^{-1}$. These results contrast with observations from other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs leads to a clear CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by a $2\times2\times2$ CDW ground state driven by a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, and charge order, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in FeGe.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic Metallic Monolayer Cu(CrSe2)2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Yang, Yuxuan Zhou, Yaozhenghang Ma, Hua Wu</p>
            <p>The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above room temperature as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking, arising from the competition of interactions and quantum fluctuations, is fundamental to understanding ordered electronic phases. Although electrically neutral, optical excitations like excitons can interact through their dipole moment, raising the possibility of optically active ordered phases. The effects of spontaneous ordering on optical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent observations of the excitonic Mott insulating state in semiconducting moiré crystals make them promising for addressing this question. Here, we present evidence for an in-plane ferroelectric phase of dipolar moiré excitons driven by strong exciton-exciton interactions. We discover a surprising speed-up of photon emission at late times and low densities in excitonic decay. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to collective radiance, linked to the transition between disordered and symmetry-broken ferroelectric phases of moiré excitons. Our findings provide first evidence for strong dipolar inter-site interactions in moiré lattices, demonstrate collective photon emission as a probe for moiré quantum materials, and pave the way for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice stands as a rich platform for hosting a wide array of correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from charge density waves and superconductivity to electron nematicity and loop current states. Direct detection of loop currents in kagome systems has remained a formidable challenge due to their intricate spatial arrangements and the weak magnetic field signatures they produce. This has left their existence and underlying mechanisms a topic of intense debate. In this work, we uncover a hallmark reconcilable with loop currents: spin handedness-selective signals that surpass conventional dichroic, spin, and spin-dichroic responses. We observe this phenomenon in the kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and we call it the anomalous spin-optical helical effect. This effect arises from the coupling of light' s helicity with spin-orbital electron correlations, providing a groundbreaking method to visualize loop currents in quantum materials. Our discovery not only enriches the debate surrounding loop currents but also paves the way for new strategies to exploit the electronic phases of quantum materials via light-matter interaction.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface.

Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Xuan Li, Ziyin Song, Zhong Fang, Zhijun Wang, Hongming Weng</p>
            <p>Various topological phases, including topological insulators, topological semimetals, and topological superconductors, along with the controllable topological phase transitions, have attracted considerable attention due to their promising applications in spintronics and quantum computing. In this work, we propose two distinct methods for manipulating topological phase transitions in magnetic materials. First, by varying the strength of electron correlation effects, we induce a series of topological state transitions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M = Zn, Cd; X = P, As, Sb) family of Zintl materials, including magnetic topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and magnetic Dirac semimetals. Our findings indicate that strong electron correlation effects tend to influence the emergence of topological phases. Second, by reducing the electronegativity of the pnictogen X (from P to As and Sb), we observe a similar transition from trivial insulator to magnetic Dirac semimetal or magnetic TCI. This suggests that weaker electronegativity favors the emergence of topological phases. Furthermore, we establish a Heisenberg model to describe the magnetic interactions of the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system, based on which we perform Monte Carlo simulations of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, yielding Néel temperatures that perfectly match experimental data. This suggests that the local magnetic moment framework provides an accurate description of the magnetization behavior in this family of materials. This work provides the potential for the experimental manipulation of topological phase transitions and their possible applications, while also enhancing the understanding of the magnetic interactions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system and offering a theoretical foundation for future applications in magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Topological Phase Transition in Superconductor-Semiconductor Hybrids by Electronic Raman Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeshi Mizushima, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the bulk TPT by exploiting the static and dynamic density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of a Bottom-Heavy Janus Particle Near a Wall Under Shear Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohreh Jalilvand, Daniele Notarmuzi, Ubaldo M. Córdova-Figueroa, Emanuela Bianchi, Ilona Kretzschmar</p>
            <p>In this study, Brownian Dynamics simulations are implemented to investigate the motion of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall under varying shear flow conditions and at small Péclet (Pe) numbers. The stochastic motion of the Janus particle impacted by surface forces is described using a set of coupled Langevin equations that takes into account the Janus particle orientation. Interactions arising from surface potentials are found to depend on the separation distance between the Janus particle and the wall, the properties of the surfaces involved, and the thickness of the Janus particle cap. When shear flow is introduced in the system, the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle is also governed by the strain rate. Furthermore, the effect of friction on the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle under shear flow is investigated and reveals that the rotational motion of the Janus particle slows down slightly when the particle is close to the surface. In summary, we demonstrate the ability to utilize Brownian Dynamics simulations to capture the rich dynamical behavior of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall and under a range of shear flow conditions, cap thicknesses, and surface charges.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transitions in superconductors with chiral symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Løvås Svalland, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco</p>
            <p>We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including $p$-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and $s$-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grant Z. X. Yang, Zi-Ting Sun, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law</p>
            <p>Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-vacuum-protected topological edge polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raditya Weda Bomantara</p>
            <p>This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are protected by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of neutral atomic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (atomic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.</p>

            <p>Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.</p>

            <h2>Exponential Change of Relaxation Rate by Quenched Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Meibohm, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>We determine the asymptotic relaxation rate of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential perturbed by quenched Gaussian disorder, a simplified model for rugged energy landscapes in complex systems. Depending on the properties of the disorder, we show that the mean and variance of the asymptotic relaxation rate are non-monotonous functions of the parameters for a broad class of disorders. In particular, the rate of relaxation may either increase or decrease exponentially compared to the unperturbed case. This implies that disorder may, depending on its properties, both significantly speed up \textit{and} slow down relaxation. In the limit of weak disorder, we derive the probability distribution of the asymptotic relaxation rate and show that it is Gaussian, with analytic expressions for the mean and variance that feature universal limits. Our findings indicate that controlled disorder may serve to tune the relaxation speed in complex systems.</p>

            <p>The transport properties (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity) of iron-hydrogen alloys are of great significance in the stability and evolution of planetary magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the thermal transport properties of iron doped with varying hydrogen content as functions of pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the top and bottom of Earth's outer core and beyond, corresponding to pressures of about 130 to 300 GPa and temperatures of 4000 to 7000 K. Using first-principles density functional theory molecular dynamic simulations (FPMD), we verify that crystalline FeH$_x$ is superionic with H diffusing freely. We find a low frequency viscosity of 10-11 mPa$\cdot$s for liquid Fe-H alloys at Earth's outer core conditions. We find saturation of electrical resistivity with increasing temperatures in liquid iron at outer core conditions. The effect of H on electrical and thermal transport we find is small, so that the exact H content of the core is not needed. The primary effect of H is on the equation of state, decreasing the density at constant P and T. We find the Lorenz number is smaller than the ideal value, and obtain for X(H)= 0.20, or 0.45 wt% H , thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of $\sim$105 and $\sim$190 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively, at conditions near the core-mantle and inner-outer core boundary.</p>

            <h2>Impurity States in Altermagnetic Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Maiani, Rubén Seoane Souto</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether the impurity respects the bulk symmetries or not, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the Néel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling a new approach for in-situ control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements like scanning tunneling microscopy and open new avenues for designing tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack-William Barotta, Giuseppe Pucci, Eli Silver, Alireza Hooshanginejad, Daniel M. Harris</p>
            <p>When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Liu, Wen-Hao Bian, Xiao-Zhuo Chu, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</p>

            <p>We study the deformation of a liquid interface with arbitrary principal curvatures by a flat circular sheet. Working first at small slopes, we determine the shape of the sheet analytically in the membrane limit, where the sheet is inextensible yet free to bend and compress. We find that the sheet takes a cylindrical shape on interfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Numerical energy minimization confirm our predictions and show that this behavior holds for finite slopes. Experiments on a thin polystyrene film at an anisotropic air-water interface show consistent behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang</p>
            <p>While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</p>

We describe an experimental arrangement wherein chiral objects, spinners, floating on the surface of a vibrated fluid rotate due to emitted capillary waves. We observe that pairs of spinners can assemble at quantized distances via the mutually generated wavefield, phase synchronize and, in some circumstances, globally rotate about a point midway between them. A mathematical model based on wave-mediated interactions captures the salient features of the assembly and synchronization while a qualitative argument is able to rationalize global rotations based on interference and radiation stress associated with the wavefield. Extensions to larger collections are demonstrated, highlighting the potential for this tabletop system to be used as an experimental system capable of synchronizing and swarming.</p>

Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <p>In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</p>

We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p>Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</p>

Additionally, strong hybridization of spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach geometry was observed, which is attractive for applications in magnonic signal processing circuits.</p>

            <h2>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritha Dolai, Arghya Das</p>
            <p>We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, violation of Fourier's law, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a Seebeck-like effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active particles driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Relationship between polymorphic structures and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($A$' = Sm, Gd)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valérie Paul-Boncour, Véronique Charbonnier, Nicolas Madern, Lotfi Bessais, Judith Monnier, Junxian Zhang</p>
            <p>In this study, the crystal structure and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x} A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds with magnetic rare earth elements ($A$' = Sm, Gd) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$ hexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type) polymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and [$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-this http URL average cell volume decreases linearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$ = 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two different subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure type and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions towards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied field of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two different transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with $x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for $A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and 3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with transition field $\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with $A$' = Sm. The La$_{2-x}Sm_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0} behave as hard magnets with a large coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{C}$ at low temperature ($\mu_{0}H_{C}$ > 9 T at 5 K for $x$ = 2), whereas the La$_{2-x} Gd_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0) are soft ferrimagnets with a linear increase of the saturation magnetization versus Gd content.</p>

            <p>In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.</p>

Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.</p>

            <p>In view of their advantages for memory and storage applications, the quest to find suitable magnetic thin film heterostructures that can exhibit strong spin pumping effect persists in the scientific community. Here, the spin pumping phenomenon is investigated in Ta/Galfenol (FeGa) thin film heterostructures by systematically varying the thickness of the heavy metallic Ta underlayer (UL). The films exhibit soft magnetic property with a bcc-phase with a notably low Gilbert damping obtained for FeGa on Si (100). The precessional magnetization dynamics of Ta/FeGa films are explored using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry, revealing the presence of a resonant Kittel mode and additional strain-induced modes. The lowest value of effective Gilbert damping in Ta/FeGa is obtained as ~ 0.015, which rises by ~ 65 % as the thickness of UL increases. Spin pumping and two-magnon scattering mechanisms are validated using a ballistic spin transport model. An overall effective spin mixing conductance value of ~ 5.48 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is found, which is the highest value ever reported in magnetostrictive Galfenol films. Additionally, micromagnetic simulations are performed to understand the effect of tilted magnetic anisotropy on the formation of magnetic modes in these films. These findings in FeGa films establish it as an effective spin source material and offer innovative ideas to control spin-wave propagation and diverse applications in straintronics.</p>

These giant vortices are stationary, obtainable by imaginary-time propagation using a Gaussian initial state, while the appropriate phase of the giant vortex is imprinted on the initial wave function. The dynamical stability of the giant vortices is established by real-time propagation during a long interval of time after a small change of a parameter.</p>

            <p>We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengnan Du, Zhao Liu</p>
            <p>We study quantum quench of finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed in disordered Kane-Mele model, which we attribute to the existence of a disorder-induced gapless region. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench exhibits similar dependence on the quench rate as the excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models. This similarity still holds in the bulk of the system even when we consider realistic open boundary conditions, facilitating the experimental characterization of the dynamic features in these models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas D Swinburne, Clovis Lapointe, Mihai-Cosmin Marinica</p>
            <p>We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</p>

            <h2>Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh</p>
            <p>The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Kramer</p>
            <p>Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</p>

We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., NumPy versus the PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow libraries, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.</p>

            <p>Understanding neural representations will help open the black box of neural networks and advance our scientific understanding of modern AI systems. However, how complex, structured, and transferable representations emerge in modern neural networks has remained a mystery. Building on previous results, we propose the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH), which posits a set of six alignment relations to universally govern the formation of representations in most hidden layers of a neural network. Under the CRH, the latent representations (R), weights (W), and neuron gradients (G) become mutually aligned during training. This alignment implies that neural networks naturally learn compact representations, where neurons and weights are invariant to task-irrelevant transformations. We then show that the breaking of CRH leads to the emergence of reciprocal power-law relations between R, W, and G, which we refer to as the Polynomial Alignment Hypothesis (PAH). We present a minimal-assumption theory proving that the balance between gradient noise and regularization is crucial for the emergence of the canonical representation. The CRH and PAH lead to an exciting possibility of unifying major key deep learning phenomena, including neural collapse and the neural feature ansatz, in a single framework.</p>

Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</p>

            <p>Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</p>

We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta < 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta > 1$.</p>

            <p>Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may not capture complex behaviors with the same accuracy. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help to overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.</p>

            <h2>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko</p>
            <p>There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</p>

By adjusting phonon number, we reveal the nonlinear energy levels of the hybridized system and confirm single-phonon nonlinearity. We also observe fluctuations between hybridized and bare resonance states as the TLS fluctuates between on- and off-resonance. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from intrinsic material properties, without requiring external electromagnetic systems or complex quantum circuits.

            <p>We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</p>

The functional mixes Hartree-Fock exchange with the semilocal exchange of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) and the fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange is determined from the dielectric function. First-principles calculations and comparison with other meta-GGA approximations show that the functional leads to reasonably good performance for the band gap and optical properties. We also show that the present functional also successfully resolves the well-known ``band gap problem'' of narrow gap Cu-based semiconductors, such as Cu3SbSe4 and Cu3AsSe4, where, in general, a considerably large band inversion energy leads to a ``false'' negative or metallic band gap for all other methods. Furthermore, reasonable accuracy for the occupied d-bands and transition energies is also obtained for bulk solids. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate the predictive power of range-separated meta-GGA hybrid functionals for quantum materials simulations.</p>

            <h2>Theory of interaction-induced charge order in CrSBr</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Hao Cui, Andrew J. Millis, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>CrSBr is a layered van der Waals insulator with a quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and in-plane ferromagnetic order. Recent experimental work on Li-doped CrSBr reveals quasi-1D charge modulated states. In this study, we develop ab initio effective models for CrSBr to investigate these states and solve them using mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions. If the interaction is hard-truncated to a short-ranged form, some localized stripe-like states are computationally favored. This work provides an ab initio framework for understanding the interplay of competing electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and related materials.</p>

            <p>Two single crystal phases of tantalum nitride were stabilized on c-plane sapphire using molecular beam epitaxy. The phases were identified to be $\delta$-TaN with a rocksalt cubic structure and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N with a hexagonal structure. Atomic force microscopy scans revealed smooth surfaces for both the films with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.3 nm. Phase-purity of these films was determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman spectrum of the phase-pure $\delta$-TaN and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N obtained will serve as a future reference to determine phase-purity of tantalum nitride films. Further, the room-temperature and low-temperature electronic transport measurements indicated that both of these phases are metallic at room temperature with resistivities of 586.2 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 75.5 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film and become superconducting below 3.6 K and 0.48 K respectively. The superconducting transition temperature reduces with applied magnetic field as expected. Ginzburg-Landau fitting revealed a 0 K critical magnetic field and coherence length of 18 T and 4.2 nm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 96 mT and 59 nm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film. These tantalum nitride films are of high interest for superconducting resonators and qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman Kalyan Pradhan, Arnab Bera, Soham Das, Yongli Yu, Jicheng Wang, Rui Wu</p>
            <p>Spin-phonon interactions in 2D magnetic materials are crucial in advancing next-generation spintronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials with significant spin-phonon interactions is of great importance. In this context, MnSe, previously recognized as an exemplary non-layered p-type semiconductor emerges in this study as an intriguing material with notable spin-phonon characteristics. The complex magnetism in pristine MnSe, primarily dominated by antiferromagnetism with a weak ferromagnetic component, gives rise to both spontaneous and conventional exchange bias effects at low temperatures. In an effort to understand this intriguing magnetism, we conducted a detailed Raman spectroscopy study, which reveals unconventional deviations from the usual phonon anharmonicity around Neel temperature (170 K), in the self-energies of the P1, P2, and P3 modes. Notably, the P1 mode is most sensitive to spin-phonon coupling, while the P2 mode is particularly responsive to the structural phase transition at 250 K. Therefore, these findings provide comprehensive insights into the phase transitions of pristine MnSe, particularly highlighting the previously unobserved interplay between its magnetic behavior and phonon dynamics.</p>

            <p>Topological physics has evolved from its initial focus on fermionic systems to the exploration of bosonic systems, particularly phononic excitations in crystalline materials. Two-dimensional (2D) topological phonons emerge as promising candidates for future technological applications. Currently, experimental verification of 2D topological phonons has remained exclusively limited to graphene, a constraint that hinders their applications in phononic devices. Here, we report experimental evidence of topological phonons in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride using advanced high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our high-precision measurements explicitly demonstrate two topological nodal rings in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, protected by mirror symmetry, expanding the paradigm of 2D topological phonons beyond graphene. This research not only deepens fundamental understanding of 2D topological phonons, but also establishes a phononic device platform based on wide-bandgap insulators, crucial for advancements in electronics and photonics applications.</p>

            <h2>Nested Shadows of Anyons:A Framework for Identifying Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Tak Oh, Hyun-Yong Lee</p>
            <p>The 1-form symmetries in two-dimensional topological systems are ``shadowed'' as global symmetries in their one-dimensional quantum transfer matrices. In this work, we introduce a distinct shadow effect arising from the pair-creation of anyons, which manifests as a local symmetry of the quantum transfer matrix. The interplay between these two shadow effects provides a powerful framework for characterizing topological phases without extensive numerical simulations. Specifically, we derive the phase diagram of the filtered toric code state and precisely identify phase boundaries using the nested shadows of anyons. Additionally, we reveal that a class of topological states host gapless edge modes protected by 1-form symmetry rather than global symmetry. Finally, we apply our approach to the three-dimensional toric code and X-cube states, uncovering a nontrivial path in phase space that connects them through a subdimensional critical point, which is highly challenging to detect numerically due to the complexity of simulating three-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Yang, YuBin Zhang, Heng Lu, Ce Zhang, FengNan Chen, Ying Yan, Fei Xue, Alexander Eichler, Joel Moser</p>
            <p>Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequency. Here, we present measurements of the response of a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry of the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. Parametric oscillations with broken phase symmetry hold promise as units of binary information. Their phase states can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Our work invites future studies on coupled graphene parametric resonators whose phase states may be mapped to a system of Ising spins.</p>

            <p>Anisotropy plays a critical role in governing the mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, influencing their behavior across diverse applications. Probing and quantifying this directional dependence is crucial for advancing materials science and biomedical research, as it provides a deeper understanding of structural orientations at the molecular level, encompassing both scientific and industrial benefits. This study introduces the "4+ Angle Polarization" widget, an innovative extension to the open-source Quasar platform (this https URL), tailored for advanced multiple-angle polarization analysis. This toolbox enables precise molecular orientation analysis of complex microspectroscopic datasets through a streamlined workflow. Using polarized Fourier transform infrared (p-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate its versatility across various sample types, including polylactic acid (PLA) organic crystals, murine cortical bone, and human osteons. By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis. This novel analytical tool expands the potential of multiple-angle p-FTIR techniques into advanced characterization of structural anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, providing transformative insights for materials characterization, biomedical imaging and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jongbae Hong</p>
            <p>The complex gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance in quantum point contacts, shaped by entangled-state tunneling, was demonstrated through the movement of a localized spin. This spin responds to variations in side gate voltage, triggering a quantum phase transition (QPT) between symmetric and asymmetric Kondo coupling states, with the states separated by conductance regions $G \geq 0.7 G_0$ and $G \leq 0.7 G_0$, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, respectively. The asymmetric state has two Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The presence of two Kondo temperatures in the asymmetric state clarifies previously unresolved issues, such as the indeterminate Kondo temperature and anomalous behavior in the width of the zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in the $G \leq 0.7 G_0$ region. The QPT was investigated by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent ZBA energy, calculated using the corresponding local density of states at the site of the localized spin, obtained during the replication of the differential conductance.</p>

            <p>Creating superior lanthanide-activated inorganic phosphors is pivotal for advancing energy-efficient LED lighting and backlit flat panel displays. The most fundamental property these luminescent materials must possess is effective absorption/excitation by a blue InGaN LED for practical conversion into white light. The 5$d_1$ excited state energy level of lanthanides, which determines the excitation peak position, is influenced by the inorganic host structure, including the local environment, crystal structure, and composition, making it challenging to predict in advance. This study introduces a new extreme gradient boosting machine learning method that quantitatively determines a phosphor's longest (lowest energy) excitation wavelength. We focus on the Ce$^{3+}$ 4$f$ $\rightarrow$ 5$d$ transition due to its well-defined 5$d_1$ energy level observed in excitation and diffuse reflectance spectra. The model was trained on experimental data for 357 Ce$^{3+}$ cation substitution sites sourced from literature and in-house measurements and ultimately experimentally validated through the successful synthesis of a novel, blue-excited, green-emitting phosphor: Ca$_2$SrSc$_6$O$_{12}$:Ce$^{3+}$. This compound's excitation under commercial blue LED wavelength aligned remarkably well with the model's predictions. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-driven approaches in expediting the discovery of blue-absorbing phosphors for next-generation LED lighting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sai Saraswathi Yarajena, Akshay K. Naik</p>
            <p>Piezoelectric materials play a vital role in energy harvesting, piezotronics and various self-powered sensing applications. The piezoelectric strength of 2D materials is limited by the carrier charge screening, leading to reduced open circuit voltages and poor piezotronic performances. Reducing the carrier screening in devices is a key requirement to fully utilize the potential of 2D materials for piezoelectric applications. In this work, we demonstrate that lateral heterojunction devices offer an excellent way to improve the piezoelectric open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. Because of the asymmetric contacts with Nickel (Ni) electrodes, the heterojunctions of monolayer(1L) MoS_2 and MoTe_2 form a hybrid Schottky/p-n diode. We demonstrate a rectification ratio of more than 5000 without electrostatic gating. We observed that devices with higher junction potentials exhibit piezoelectric open-circuit voltages exceeding 1V and a peak power density of 690 mW/m^2. The output characteristics reveal a trade-off between open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. These findings and the role of built-in (cut-in) voltages in energy harvesting provide valuable insights for the design of piezotronic junctions to achieve high piezoelectric output and/or rectification ratios. Design aspects of heterojunctions discussed in this manuscript can be applied to other emerging nanomaterials.</p>

            <h2>Exchange Coupling Modulation in MN4-Embedded Graphene Layers (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) Under Strain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahnaz Rezaei, Jahanfar Abouie, Fariba Nazari</p>
            <p>MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, with transition metal elements M, are experimentally accessible two-dimensional (2D) materials and show great potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these materials, the exchange couplings between magnetic atoms are predominantly governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an unusual prolonged decay of r to the power of minus n, where r is the M-M separation distance, and n is between 0.5 and 2. In this paper, we explore the effects of induced strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers through ab-initio density functional theory. We employ a specific method to apply strain by positioning atoms from one layer within the equilibrium structure of another layer, thereby inducing strain in the form of either tension or compression. The induced strain results in an approximate plus/minus 0.4% variation in the unit-cell area of the MN4-G lattice. Our findings reveal that while the exchange coupling mechanism remains unaffected, the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling are significantly influenced by the induced strain. Notably, the CoN4-G layer exhibits a remarkable increase in the strength and oscillation amplitude of the RKKY coupling, along with a reduced decay rate. Additionally, the electronic and magnetic properties of the CuN4-G layers remain unchanged under induced strain.</p>

            <p>Topological phase transitions can be remarkably induced purely by manipulating gain and loss mechanisms, offering a novel approach to engineering topological properties. Recent theoretical studies have revealed gain-loss-induced topological disclination states, along with the associated fractional charge trapped at the disclination sites. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of topological disclination states in a purely lossy electric circuit. By designing alternating lossy electric circuit networks that correspond to the disclination lattice, we observe a voltage response localized at the disclination sites and demonstrate the robustness of these states against disorder. Furthermore, we measure the charge distribution, confirming the presence of fractional charge at the disclination sites, which gives rise to the topological disclination states. Our experiment provides direct evidence of gain-loss-induced topological disclination states in electric circuits, opening new possibilities for applications in classical systems.</p>

            <p>This study presents a novel method for fabricating stoichiometric SnS thin films with large grain sizes via reactive sputtering using a metallic Sn target and sulfur plasma (S-plasma). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on toxic H2S gas, this method employs a S-plasma to enhance sulfur reactivity and mitigate sulfur deficiencies during film deposition. By optimizing the balance between the sputtering conditions of the Sn target and the supply conditions of the S-plasma, dense single-phase SnS thin films with micron-scale grain sizes were achieved at a substrate temperature of 300 degree C, achieving an in-plane Hall mobility of 13 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, crystalline SnS thin films were fabricated even on a room-temperature substrate, enabling potential applications in flexible devices with heat-sensitive substrates. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of S-plasma in advancing SnS thin film fabrication, providing a safer and more efficient route to high-performance photovoltaic materials.</p>

            <p>To understand the complex interplay of topography and surface chemistry in wetting, fundamental studies investigating both parameters are needed. Due to the sensitivity of wetting to miniscule changes in one of the parameters it is imperative to precisely control the experimental approach. A profound understanding of their influence on wetting facilitates a tailored design of surfaces with unique functionality. We present a multi-step study: The influence of surface chemistry is analyzed by determining the adsorption of volatile carbonous species (A) and by sputter deposition of metallic copper and copper oxides on flat copper substrates (B). A precise surface topography is created by laser processing. Isotropic topography is created by ps laser processing (C), and hierarchical anisotropic line patterns are produced by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) with different pulse durations (D). Our results reveal that the long-term wetting response of polished copper surfaces stabilizes with time despite ongoing accumulation of hydrocarbons and is dominated by this adsorption layer over the oxide state of the substrate (Cu, CuO, Cu2O). The surfaces' wetting response can be precisely tuned by tailoring the topography via laser processing. The sub-pattern morphology of primary line-like patterns showed great impact on the static contact angle, wetting anisotropy, and water adhesion. An increased roughness inside the pattern valleys combined with a minor roughness on the peaks favors air-inclusions, isotropic hydrophobicity, and low water adhesion. Increasing the aspect ratio showed to enhance air-inclusions and hydrophobicity despite increased peak roughness while time dependent wetting transitions were observed.</p>

At the monolayer-limit, the SrIrO3 films directly transform from an insulating state to a metallic state, highlighting the intriguing interplay of dimensionality and hydrostatic pressure in correlated oxides, which can be unveiled through the universal high-pressure strategy.</p>

            <p>The advancement of semiconductor materials has played a crucial role in the development of electronic and optical devices. However, scaling down semiconductor devices to the nanoscale has imposed limitations on device properties due to quantum effects. Hence, the search for successor materials has become a central focus in the fields of materials science and physics. Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are extraordinary materials known for their outstanding stability, biocompatibility, and ability to integrate with semiconductors. Over the past few decades, TMNs have been extensively employed in various fields. However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMNs has long been challenging, hindering the advancement of their high-performance electronics and plasmonics. Fortunately, progress in film deposition techniques has enabled the successful epitaxial growth of high-quality TMN films. In comparison to reported reviews, there is a scarcity of reviews on epitaxial TMN films from the perspective of materials physics and condensed matter physics, particularly at the atomic level. Therefore, this review aims to provide a brief summary of recent progress in epitaxial growth at atomic precision, emergent physical properties (superconductivity, magnetism, ferroelectricity, and plasmon), and advanced electronic and plasmonic devices associated with epitaxial TMN films.</p>

Using an effective Hamiltonian that includes in- and out-of-plane lattice relaxation, we analyze SMS in hBN-encapsulated single and bilayer graphene. We prescribe methods to experimentally verify these fractals and extract their fractal dimension through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

We find that the excited electrons relax slower into phonons for higher carrier densities. The electron-phonon scattering rate changes in a nonlinear way from 400 fs at ~$2 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ to 1.2 ps at ~$4 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$. These results indicate that a hot electron gas quenches the scattering into phonons in a temperature-dependent way. Ultrafast electronic circuitry of silicon therefore should work faster and provide higher bandwidths at lower carrier densities.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced deep-freezing magneto- and elasto-caloric effects by modifying lattice anharmonicity and electronic structures</h2>

            <p>Designing the high performance magneto or elastocaloric effect in NiMnIn alloys with spin-lattice coupling in a deep freezing temperature range of 200 K to 255 K is challenging due to the limited lattice entropy change and large negative contribution of magnetic entropy change during phase transitions. In this work, we systematically study the first order magneto-structural transition in NiMnIn based alloys by in-situ microstructural characterizations, physical property measurements, and first principles calculations. A multi element alloying strategy involving Cu and Ga co doping is proposed to manipulate the phase transition. The co doping reduces the lattice anharmonicity and thermal expansion coefficient of the martensitic phase, leading to an increase in the unit cell volume change and lattice entropy change. It also modifies the electronic density of states, causing a decrease in the magnetization change .The relief of the lattice mismatch reduces hysteresis losses in the refrigeration cycle. These synergetic effects yield excellent magneto and elastocaloric effects,with the effective magnetocaloric refrigeration capacity reaching up to 182 J/kg under the magnetic field of 5 T or an adiabatic temperature change of -4 K under a low field of 1.5 T and the elastocaloric coefficient of performance to 30 or an adiabatic temperature change of -7 K with the strain of 5% at 230 K, offering a potential solution for solid-state deep-freezing refrigeration.</p>

            <h2>A few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by digitally modulated video signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ce Zhang, Heng Lu, Chen Yang, YuBin Zhang, FengNan Chen, Ying Yan, Joel Moser</p>
            <p>Nanomechanical resonators driven by multifrequency signals combine the physics of mesoscopic vibrations and the technologies of radio communication. Their simplest property stems from their resonant response: they behave as filters, responding only to driving signals whose frequency range is contained within that of the mechanical response. While the response is routinely probed with a single tone drive, a multifrequency drive offers the possibility of inducing richer vibrational dynamics. In this case, all the frequency components of the drive are simultaneously transduced into vibrations with different amplitudes and phases that superimpose and interfere. Here, we employ a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator as a filter for broadband, digitally modulated video signals. We transduce the modulated drive into modulated vibrations, which we demodulate into a nanomechanical video. Our work reveals distinctive features in vibrations driven by a coherent, multifrequency drive unseen in vibrations actuated by single tone drives or by a force noise.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning short-ranged many-body interactions in colloidal systems using descriptors based on Voronoi cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinske M. Alkemade, Rastko Sknepnek, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interaction and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheikh Moonsun Pervez, Saptarshi Mandal</p>
            <p>We perform a systematic and exact study of Majorana fermion dynamics in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ model in a few finite-size clusters increasing in size up to twelve sites. We employ exact Jordan-Wigner transformations to evaluate certain measures of Majorana fermion correlation functions, which effectively capture matter and gauge Majorana fermion dynamics in different parameter regimes. An external magnetic field is shown to produce a profound effect on gauge fermion dynamics. Depending on certain non-zero choices of other non-Kitaev interactions, it can stabilise it to its non-interacting Kitaev limit. For all the parameter regimes, gauge fermions are seen to have slower dynamics, which could help build approximate decoupling schemes for appropriate mean-field theory. The probability of Majorana fermions returning to their original starting site shows that the Kitaev model in small clusters can be used as a test bed for the quantum speed limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fraser Birks, Thomas D Swinburne, James R Kermode</p>
            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</p>

            <p>Organic electrode-active materials (OAMs) not only enable a variety of charge and storage mechanisms, but are also safer for the environment and of lower cost compared to materials in commonly used lithium-ion batteries. Cross-linked Poly(3)-vinyl-N-methylphenothiazine (X-PVMPT) is a p-type OAM which shows high performance and enables fast and reversible energy storage in different battery configurations. The performance of an OAM does not only depend on its molecular or polymer structure, but also on the structure of the composite electrode. The porous nanostructure of an electrode composed of X-PVMPT, a conductive carbon additive and binder is investigated by statistical image analysis, based on 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning-electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) measurements. Univariate probability distributions of relevant morphological descriptors as well as bivariate distributions of pairs of such descriptors are parametrically modelled, among others, by utilization of copulas in the latter case. These models are then used for quantifying local heterogeneities of X-PVMPT considered in this paper. Furthermore, it is shown that the nanostructure changes when traversing from bottom to top face of the electrode, which influences its performance. While the observed short transportation paths trough the solid phase are beneficial in terms of electrical conductivity, the pathways through the pore phase influencing the effective ionic diffusivity are--in comparison--rather long.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Alonso-Marroquin</p>
            <p>Based on bond percolation theory, a method is presented here to calculate the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation in porous media from first principles. The governing equations are formulated on the undirected graph of the pore network. The graph is a simplified mathematical object that accounts for the topology of the pore structure. Thus, the calculation is extremely computationally efficient since it is mesh-free and voxel-free. Two topological invariants are identified: The bond percolation threshold and the residual saturation. Bond percolation theory is used to obtain a closed-form pressure-saturation relation in terms of the geometry of the pores (pore throat distribution) and material parameters (contact angle and interfacial tension), universal exponents, and topological invariants, based on scaling relations.</p>

We observed a clear relationship between the annealing temperature and the parameters of magnetic property. The most significant changes of both the magnetic anisotropy and the magnetoelastic properties were correlated with the appearance of the L21 ordered phase, suggesting that the emergence of magnetic Weyl semimetallic feature is the key point to vary these magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled GaN nanowires are typically grown on Si substrates with convenient nucleation layers. Light-emitting devices based on arrays of GaN nanowires require that the nucleation layer is electrically conductive and optically nontransparent to prevent the absorption of generated light in the Si substrate. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on ZrN nucleation layers sputtered on sapphire and demonstrates that ZrN provides ohmic contact to dense vertical arrays of n-type GaN nanowires. The ohmic nature of the ZrN/n-type GaN nanowire contact is evidenced by the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of individual as-grown nanowires using nanomanipulators in a scanning electron microscope. The limitations and advantages of single-nanowire measurements are discussed, and approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the measurement of single nanowire with a p-n junction, exhibiting highly rectifying characteristics.</p>

            <p>Inferring viscoelasticity parameters is a key challenge that often leads to non-unique solutions when fitting rheological data. In this context, we propose a machine learning approach that utilizes Bayesian optimization for parameter inference during curve-fitting processes. To fit a viscoelastic model to rheological data, the Bayesian optimization maps the parameter values to a given error function. It then exploits the mapped space to identify parameter combinations that minimize the error. We compare the Bayesian optimization results to traditional fitting routines and demonstrate that our approach finds the fitting parameters in a less or similar number of iterations. Furthermore, it also creates a "white-box" and supervised framework for parameter estimation in linear viscoelasticity modeling.</p>

            <p>Most Mn-rich cathodes are known to undergo phase transformation into structures resembling spinel-like ordering upon electrochemical cycling. Recently, the irreversible transformation of Ti-containing Mn-rich disordered rock-salt cathodes into a phase -- named $\delta$ -- with nanoscale spinel-like domains has been shown to increase energy density, capacity retention, and rate capability. However, the nature of the boundaries between domains and their relationship with composition and electrochemistry are not well understood. In this work, we discuss how the transformation into the multi-domain structure results in eight variants of Spinel domains, which is crucial for explaining the nanoscale domain formation in the $\delta$-phase. We study the energetics of crystallographically unique boundaries and the possibility of Li-percolation across them with a fine-tuned CHGNet machine learning interatomic potential. Energetics of $16d$ vacancies reveal a strong affinity to segregate to the boundaries, thereby opening Li-pathways at the boundary to enhance long-range Li-percolation in the $\delta$ structure. Defect calculations of the relatively low-mobility Ti show how it can influence the extent of Spinel ordering, domain morphology and size significantly; leading to guidelines for engineering electrochemical performance through changes in composition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aline Ramires</p>
            <p>We propose using altermagnetic phases as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators. The transmutation of pure into mixed altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and the concomitant development of an anomalous Hall response can be associated with the breaking of specific lattice symmetries by external fields or the development of subleading order parameters. We introduce the basic ideas in the context of RuO$_2$ and discuss the case of surface magnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our study suggests that if Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ hosts a pure altermagnet on its surface, the onset of specific superconducting states could transmute this altermagnet from pure to mixed and account for the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at the superconducting transition temperature, without necessarily ascribing TRSB to the superconducting state. Further investigation of this unusual scenario could provide essential steps toward a more coherent picture of the phenomenology of this material.</p>

            <p>Soft machines display shape adaptation to external circumstances due to their intrinsic compliance. To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iman Abdoli, Abhinav Sharma, Hartmut Löwen</p>
            <p>A Brownian gyrator is a system in which a particle experiences thermal noise from two distinct heat baths. This nonequilibrium setup inherently generates a nonzero torque, leading to gyrating motion around a potential energy minimum. As a minimal model for a heat engine, the Brownian gyrator provides valuable insights into energy conversion and nonequilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of an externally imposed shear flow on a Brownian gyrator, treating it as a mechanical load. The shear flow introduces a tunable mechanism that allows the system to operate either as a heat engine, extracting work from the temperature gradient, or as a refrigerator, transferring heat from the colder to the hotter bath. Focusing on the heat engine regime, we analytically derive the steady-state probability distribution to compute the average torque exerted by the gyrator and quantify the mechanical power extracted from the shear. Our results show a remarkable increase in efficiency compared to the standard Brownian gyrator without shear, approaching Carnot efficiency at maximum power. Surprisingly, we also find that while the system can operate efficiently as a heat engine, it may become unstable before reaching the stall condition, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in shear-driven microscopic engines.</p>

Recently, the hexaaluminates \textit{R}MgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ (\textit{R} = rare earth) have been proposed to be a platform for realizing the quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropic correlations. Here, we report detailed low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation, and thermodynamic studies on the CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ single crystal. Ising anisotropy is revealed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. Muon spin relaxation and ac susceptibility measurements rule out any long-range magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50 mK despite the onset of spin correlations below $\sim$0.8 K. Instead, the spins keep fluctuating at a rate of 1.0(2) MHz at 50 mK. Specific heat results indicate a gapless excitation with a power-law dependence on temperature, $C_m(T) \propto T^{\alpha}$. The quasi-quadratic temperature dependence with $\alpha$ = 2.28(4) in zero field and linear temperature dependence in 0.25 T support the possible realization of the U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid state.</p>

            <p>Minimal Kitaev chains, composed of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor, have emerged as an attractive platform to realize Majorana bound states (MBSs). These excitations exist when the ground state is degenerate. The additional requirement of isolating the MBS wavefunctions further restricts the parameter space to discrete sweet spots. While scaling up to Kitaev chains with more than two sites has the potential to improve the stability of the MBSs, longer chains offer more features to optimize, including the MBS localization length and the excitation gap. In this work, we theoretically investigate 3-site Kitaev chains and show that there are three different types of sweet spots, obtained by maximizing distinct MBS properties: genuine 3-site sweet spots with well-localized MBSs at the ends, effective 2-site sweet spots, where the middle site acts as a barrier, and sweet spots with delocalized MBSs that overlap in the middle of the chain. These three cases feature different degrees of robustness against perturbations, with the genuine 3-site being the most stable. We analyze the energy spectrum, transport, and microwave absorption associated with these three cases, showing how to distinguish them.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently proposed and experimentally confirmed class of magnetic order, features collinear compensated magnetism with unconventional d-, g-, or i-wave spin order. Here, we show that in a metallic 2D d-wave altermagnet with combined two-fold spin and four-fold lattice rotational symmetry $[C_2||C_4]$, secondary instabilities can arise. Using an unbiased functional renormalization group approach, we analyze the weak-coupling instabilities of a 2D Hubbard model with a preexisting altermagnetic order inspired by our ab initio electronic structure calculations of realistic material candidates from V$_2$X$_2$O (X = Te, Se) family. We identify two distinct spin density wave (SDW) states that break the underlying altermagnetic $[C_2||C_4]$ symmetry. Additionally, we find spin-fluctuation-induced instabilities leading to a singlet d-wave superconducting state and an unconventional commensurate pair density wave (PDW) state with extended s-wave and spin-triplet symmetry. We establish a general criterion for the unusual exchange statistics for these pair density waves and characterize their excitation spectrum, which exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces or nodal points depending on the gap size.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient, $D$, for ultrasound propagating in a multiple scattering medium, such as a dense granular suspension, can be measured using a time reversal experiment. This requires an unprecedented experimental setup in which a piezoelectric transducer, acting as a Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM), is embedded within the granular suspension at a depth much larger than the scattering mean free path, while an array of transducers is placed in the far field of the scattering sample. A single element of the array emits a short pulse and the TRM records the resulting ultrasonic field, which consists of a ballistic coherent wave followed by a coda wave. When the entire coda wave is time-reversed and re-emitted from the TRM, it is observed to refocus on the original source, with a focal spot size that decreases with the inverse depth of the TRM, characteristic of a diffusive regime. Time-reversal of short windows selected at different times $t$ in the coda wave reveals a focal spot size that decreases as the inverse square root of time, i.e., $1 / \sqrt{Dt}$. By fitting the predictions of a microscopic diffusion theory to our experimental data, we are able to accurately measure the diffusion coefficient in the granular suspension. Remarkably, this method does not require ensemble averaging due to stability of time-reversal against statistical fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moiré materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moiré materials that break either time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\circ$ twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA) and forms an inversion broken \moire superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and detection.</p>

In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.</p>

The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to conduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With our method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\% of the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We also show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase Approximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful convergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons, polarons, and interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Rewards-based image analysis in microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamyar Barakati, Yu Liu, Utkarsh Pratiush, Boris N. Slautin, Sergei V. Kalinin</p>
            <p>Analyzing imaging and hyperspectral data is crucial across scientific fields, including biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.</p>

            <h2>Optimal neutralization of negative space charges in photon-enhanced thermionic emission devices under bidirectional discharge</h2>

            <p>In this study, we innovatively modeled photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices, incorporating positive ion injection and bidirectional discharge's effects on the space charge barrier simultaneously. Compared to previous models, our model allows the positive ion distribution function to be compatible with scenarios in which the anode motive is either higher or lower than the cathode motive, and also adapts to significant anode discharge. Through numerical simulations and parametric analyses, we found that: (1) As the ratio of the positive ion increases, the capability for space charge neutralization becomes stronger. (2) The lower the electron affinity is, the smaller the ratio of positive ions are required. (3) When the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is lower, the impact of reverse discharge on the net current density is more pronounced. Conversely, when the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is greater, the ratio of positive ions required to achieve complete space charge neutralization increases. This study further elucidates the mechanisms and characteristics of space charge neutralization effects in PETE devices, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing their design. Additionally, the accompanying theory and algorithm possess the potential to spark innovative research across diverse fields.</p>

            <p>Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade yet due to the complexity of these algorithms, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziruo Zhang, Cheng Peng</p>
            <p>Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazar Çakır, Richard M. Milbradt, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hernan A. Makse, Paolo Boldi, Francesco Sorrentino, Ian Stewart</p>
            <p>A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</p>

            <h2>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.</p>

            <p>The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we develop algorithmic improvements for optimizing these wave-functions which includes compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. We apply these improvements to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz finding that they lead to improved accuracy and scalability. Using these techniques, we find NNBF surpasses traditional methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperform existing NQS approaches, and achieve competitive energies compared to state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods such as HCI, ASCI, and FCIQMC. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each enhancement, showing significant gains in energy accuracy and computational efficiency. We also examine the dependence of NNBF expressiveness on the inverse participation ratio (IPR), observing that more delocalized states are generally harder to approximate.</p>

            <p>Single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) have enabled various applications in emerging photonic quantum information technologies in recent years. However, despite many efforts to improve SPAD's performance, the design of SPADs remained largely an iterative and time-consuming process where a designer makes educated guesses of a device structure based on empirical reasoning and solves the semiconductor drift-diffusion model for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., directly inferring a structure needed to achieve desired performance, which is of ultimate interest to designers, remains an unsolved problem. We propose a novel physics-aware inverse design workflow for SPADs using a deep learning model and demonstrate it with an example of finding the key parameters of semiconductor nanowires constituting the unit cell of an SPAD, given target photon detection efficiency. Our inverse design workflow is not restricted to the case demonstrated and can be applied to design conventional planar structure-based SPADs, photodetectors, and solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</p>

            <p>Quantum error correction codes with non-local connections such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) incur lower overhead and outperform surface codes on large-scale devices. These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suguru Shimomura, Jun Tanida, Yusuke Ogura</p>
            <p>A spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) handles large-scale combinatorial optimization problems owing to optical processing with spatial parallelism. However, iterative feedback in the search for optimal solutions limits processing speed even though the Ising Hamiltonian is computed optically. We propose a parallel spatial photonic Ising machine (pSPIM) utilizing spatial multiplexing to search for an optimal solution efficiently. By employing grating patterns and encoding multiple sets of Ising spins in a phase distribution, several Ising Hamiltonians are computed simultaneously. We demonstrated that Max-Cut problems requiring 100 Ising spins are solved faster as the number of processing units increases. In addition, combining the multicomponent model with parallel processing allows for efficient searching for optimal solutions to problems represented by using interaction matrixes with a rank greater than one. The pSPIM achieves high-speed searching of optimal solutions of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</p>

            <p>The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</p>

            <h2>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko</p>
            <p>There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. Currently, none of the known mathematical population-dynamic models can reproduce all these four types of functions as its solutions. This is of course a great impediment on the way towards forecasting trends in global population growth, which is an ever more urgent exercise in an era dominated by substantial climate and ecological threats. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</p>

            <p>We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can determine rigorously these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, confirming the generalized mechanism. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</p>

            <h2>Spatial mapping of intrinsic and readout nonlinearities in a strongly-driven micromechanical membrane</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Sommer, Agnes Zinth, Aditya, Menno Poot</p>
            <p>Recently, it was shown that strongly driven micromechanical resonators show mode shapes that strongly differ from the eigenmodes. This raises the question of the origin of this nonlinear behavior. We measure the spatial dependence of the nonlinearities of high-stress micromechanical membranes. The mechanical nonlinearity is determined from the frequency response and is found to be independent of the probing location. It is the phase of the response that is instrumental in extracting that intrinsic nonlinearity. Our interferometric readout results in high-harmonics generation. These harmonics have a clear spatial profile that shows ring-like patterns resembling previous reports. These patterns are reproduced by a model of the displacement-dependent reflection signal in combination with motion amplitudes of the same order as the probing wavelength.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunyang Li, Zaishuo Xia, Lin Huang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Sam Harshe, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Jia Zhang, Bin Shao, Mark B. Gerstein</p>
            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</p>

            <h2>U-Net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion Analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME) in particle-tracking data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Solomon Asghar, Ran Ni, Giorgio Volpe</p>
            <p>Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.</p>

            <h2>Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Abedlou Ahadi, N. Sadooghi</p>
            <p>We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea De Girolamo, Paolo Facchi, Peter Rabl, Saverio Pascazio, Cosmo Lupo, Giuseppe Magnifico</p>
            <p>We optimize Matrix-Product State (MPS)-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD) and the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Trey Diulus, Ashley R. Head, Jorge Anibal Boscoboinik, Andrei Kolmakov</p>
            <p>Advancements in differential pumping and electron optics over the past few decades have enabled x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements at (near-)ambient pressures, bridging the pressure gap for characterizing realistic sample chemistries. Recently, we demonstrated the capabilities of an ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) setup for in-situ plasma environment measurements, allowing plasma-surface interactions to be studied in operando rather than using the traditional before-and-after analysis approach. This new plasma-XPS technique facilitates the identification of reaction intermediates critical for understanding plasma-assisted surface processes relevant to semiconductor nanomanufacturing, such as physical vapor deposition, etching, atomic layer deposition, etc. In this report, we apply the plasma-XPS approach to monitor real-time surface chemical changes on a model Ag(111) single crystal exposed to oxidizing and reducing plasmas. We correlate surface-sensitive data with concurrent gas-phase XPS measurements and residual gas mass-spectra analysis of species generated during plasma exposure, highlighting the significant role of plasma-induced chamber wall reactions. Ultimately, we demonstrate that plasma-XPS provides comprehensive insights into both surface and gas-phase chemistry, establishing it as a versatile and dynamic characterization tool with broad applications in microelectronics research.</p>

            <p>We report a polarization-induced 2D electron gas (2DEG) at an epitaxial AlBN/GaN heterojunction grown on a SiC substrate. Using this 2DEG in a long conducting channel, we realize ultra-thin barrier AlBN/GaN high electron mobility transistors that exhibit current densities of more than 0.25 A/mm, clean current saturation, a low pinch-off voltage of -0.43 V, and a peak transconductance of 0.14 S/mm. Transistor performance in this preliminary realization is limited by the contact resistance. Capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that introducing 7 % B in the epitaxial AlBN barrier on GaN boosts the relative dielectric constant of AlBN to 16, higher than the AlN dielectric constant of 9. Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.</p>

            <p>We consider a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) model with Kerr-type on-site nonlinearity, where the nearest-neighbor coupling constants take two different values ordered in a three-periodic sequence. The existence of localized edge states in the linear limit (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger trimer, SSH3) is known to depend on the precise location of the edge. Here, we show that for a termination that does not support linear edge states, an arbitrarily weak on-site nonlinearity will induce an edge mode with asymptotic exponential localization, bifurcating from a linear band edge. Close to the gap edge, the shape of the mode can be analytically described in a continuum approximation as one half of a standard gap soliton. The linear stability properties of nonlinear edge modes are also discussed.</p>

            <p>Photon transport through turbid media has typically been modeled through diffusion or telegraph equations. These models describe behavior of the average, or typical, photon with remarkable accuracy, however, we show here that they fail to capture the Extreme First Passage Times (EFPTs) of photon transport. By sending ultra-fast bursts of photons through a scattering medium and timing the arrival of the first passage photon, we measure the distribution of these EFPTs of photons in a random environment. Our measured EFPTs differ from those predicted by both the diffusion approximation and telegraph equation. Instead, we observe the EFPT as the time expected for light to travel through an index-averaged medium. These results reveal flaws in both models and invite a re-examining of their underlying assumptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Altland, Dmitry Bagrets, Nele Callebaut, Konstantin Weisenberger</p>
            <p>A celebrated realization of the holographic principle posits an approximate duality between the $(0+1)$-dimensional quantum mechanical SYK model and two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, mediated by the Schwarzian action as an effective low energy theory common to both systems. We here propose a generalization of this correspondence to one dimension higher. Starting from different microscopic realizations of effectively chiral $(1+1)$-dimensional generalizations of the SYK model, we derive a reduction to the Alekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action which has been proposed as the effective boundary action of three-dimensional gravity. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around the Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of three-dimensional gravity. These two constructions allow us to match bulk and boundary coupling constants, and to compute observables. Specifically, we apply semiclassical techniques inspired by condensed matter physics to the computation of out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), demonstrating maximal chaos in the chiral SYK chain and its gravity dual.</p>

            <p>The ability to distinguish between correlation and causation of variables in molecular systems remains an interesting and open area of investigation. In this work, we probe causality in a molecular system using two independent computational methods that infer the causal direction through the language of information transfer. Specifically, we demonstrate that a molecular dynamics simulation involving a single Tryptophan in liquid water displays asymmetric information transfer between specific collective variables, such as solute and solvent coordinates. Analyzing a discrete Markov-state and Langevin dynamics on a 2D free energy surface, we show that the same kind of asymmetries can emerge even in extremely simple systems, undergoing equilibrium and time-reversible dynamics. We use these model systems to rationalize the unidirectional information transfer in the molecular system in terms of asymmetries in the underlying free energy landscape and/or relaxation dynamics of the relevant coordinates. Finally, we propose a computational experiment that allows one to decide if an asymmetric information transfer between two variables corresponds to a genuine causal link.</p>

We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueqing Chang, Sonali Joshi, Lucas K. Wagner</p>
            <p>We present a generalized framework, renormalized density matrix downfolding (RDMD), to derive systematically improvable, highly accurate, and nonperturbative effective models from ab initio calculations. This framework moves beyond the common role of ab initio calculations as calculating the parameters of a proposed Hamiltonian. Instead, RDMD provides the capability to decide whether a given effective Hilbert space can be identified from the ab initio data and assess the relative quality of ansatz Hamiltonians. Any method of ab initio solution can be used as a data source, and as the ab initio solutions improve, the resultant model also improves. We demonstrate the framework in an application to the downfolding of a hydrogen chain to a spin model, in which we find the interatomic separations for which a nonperturbative mapping can be made even in the strong coupling regime where standard methods fail, and compute a renormalized spin model Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces the ab initio dynamics.</p>

            <p>Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov, A. Borisov, Particles 2021, 2 (2021)]. Such a behavior is observed for both non-chiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</p>

            <p>Recently, the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ system has been used to explore various aspects of Kitaev spin liquid physics. Here, we consider a few small clusters of up to twelve sites and study them in detail to unravel many interesting findings due to the competition between all possible signs and various magnitudes of these interactions under the influence of an external magnetic field. When Heisenberg interaction is taken anti-ferromagnetic, one obtains plateaus in correlation functions where, surprisingly, the exact groundstate reduces to the eigenstate of Heisenberg interaction as well. On the other hand, for ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction, its competition with Kitaev interaction results in non-monotonicity in the correlation functions. We discuss, in detail, the competing effects on low energy spectrum, flux operator, magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be helpful to explain some of the recent experimental and theoretical findings in materials with Kitaev interactions.</p>

            <p>The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.</p>

            <p>We introduce a method based on auxiliary master equation for solving the problem of an impurity with local electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction embedded between two conduction leads with a finite bias voltage. The Anderson-Holstein Hamiltonian is transformed to a corresponding Lindblad equation with a reduced set of sites providing an optimal approximation of the hybridization function. The problem is solved in the superfermion representation using configuration interaction for fermions and bosons. The phonon basis is shifted and rotated with the intention of permitting a low phonon basis cutoff even in the strong-coupling regime. We benchmark this approach with the numerical renormalization group in equilibrium, finding excellent agreement. We observe, however, that the rotation brings no advantage beyond the bare shift. This is even more apparent out of equilibrium, where issues in convergence with respect to the size of the phononic Hilbert space occur only in the rotated basis. As an application of the method, we explore the evolution of the phononic peak in the differential conductance spectra with changing phonon frequency.</p>

For ground states, characterized by real eigenenergies across the entire regime, both fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points scale as $N^{2}$, akin to the Hermitian AAH model. However, for the first-excited states, the fidelity susceptibilities exhibit distinct scaling laws, contingent upon whether the lattice consists of even or odd sites. For even lattices, both the self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points continue to scale as $N^{2}$. In contrast, for odd lattices, the biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities diverge, while the self-normal fidelity susceptibilities exhibit linear behavior, indicating a novel scaling law.</p>

In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), as main building blocks of spintronic microwave technology, can offer a path for the development of compact and high-performance microwave detectors. On the other hand, the fascinating field of skyrmionics is bridging together concepts from topology and spintronics. Here, we show the proof of concept of the direct electrical excitation and detection of the dynamics of a topological protected magnetic texture, i.e. skyrmion at room temperature and for a wide region of applied fields, including the zero field case. This topological spin torque diode is realized with an MTJ on top of a skyrmionic material. Quantitative Magnetic Force Microscopy measurements are employed to confirm the existence of a single skyrmion in the MTJ free layer. Spin torque diode electrical measurements show the electrical excitation via spin transfer torque (STT) of a skyrmion resonant mode with frequencies near 4 GHz and a selectivity one order of magnitude smaller than the uniform modes excited in the same device. Micromagnetic simulations identify these dynamics with the excitation of the breathing mode and point out the role of thickness dependent magnetic parameters (magnetic anisotropy field and Dzyaloshinkii Moriya interaction) in both stabilizing and exciting the magnetic skyrmions.

            <p>The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal symmetry, have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying a small magnetic field as well as a tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% with the introduction of 1% impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The resulting giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originates from the nonlocal contribution of the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation of why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to dilute impurities.</p>

            <p>The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Trachenko, B. Monserrat, M. Hutcheon, C. J. Pickard</p>
            <p>Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Kinetics of Quantum Reaction-Diffusion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Gerbino, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto</p>
            <p>We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Mott insulators appearing at thickness period corresponding to nesting in CaRuO_3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Sakoda, H. Nobukane, S. Shimoda, K. Ichimura</p>
            <p>The typical material bismuth shows a several-fold change in electrical resistivity at 4 K over a 400 Å film thickness period. In 2021, we discovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 Å on strongly correlated compound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to an increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion. However, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray diffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 Å periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic correlation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott insulators depending on the film thickness.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merlin Füllgraf, Jiaozi Wang, Jochen Gemmer</p>
            <p>Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</p>

            <h2>Spin excitations in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconductors with the interlayer pairing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meiyu Lu, Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>Prompted by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, this study delves into a theoretical investigation of spin excitations within this intriguing material. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we propose that superconductivity in this compound is primarily driven by interlayer pairing mechanisms. This interlayer pairing results in an effective $s_\pm$ pairing gap, with the sign of the pairing gap varying across different Fermi pockets. In the superconducting state, our analysis reveals a striking absence of a spin resonance mode. Moreover, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.</p>

            <p>Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored.

This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials offers a promising platform for efficient control of magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based devices. However, energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and spin dynamics experiments to understand the basic SOT phenomena in all-2D vdW heterostructures are so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and tunable magnetization dynamics in a vdW heterostructure comprising out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 and topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. We measured the non-linear second harmonic Hall signal in TaIrTe4 /Fe3GaTe2 devices to evaluate the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics, which is characterized by a large and tunable out-of-plane damping-like torque. Energy-efficient and deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching is achieved at room temperature with a very low current density. First-principles calculations unveil the origin of the unconventional charge-spin conversion phenomena, considering the crystal symmetry and electronic structure of TaIrTe4. These results establish that all-vdW heterostructures provide a promising route to energy-efficient, field-free, and tunable SOT-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vidushi Sharma, Alexander J. White</p>
            <p>The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity," that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</p>

After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</p>

            <p>Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal electrical transport in linear systems with balanced gain and loss in the bulk</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rupak Bag, Dibyendu Roy</p>
            <p>We investigate electrical transport in a quantum wire of $N$ sites connected to an equal number $(N_i/2)$ of sources and drains of charges in bulk. Each source and drain injects and extracts charges at the same rate, respectively. We show that the linear-response electrical current is nonreciprocal in such a system when the arrangement of sources and drains breaks the system's parity. We prove that inelastic scattering is essential for nonreciprocity in this system. For this, we invoke a master equation description of classical charge transport in a similar system. The nonreciprocal current in quantum wire matches that in the classical model for $N_i/N \sim 1$, generating a finite scattering length much smaller than the length of the wire. The nonreciprocity in the quantum wire oscillates with wire length when $N_i/N \ll 1$, and it can vanish at specific lengths.</p>

On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical energy minimization. Finally, we compute the energy of placing the sheet on the curved interface and find that it is much lower for positive Gaussian curvatures than for negative ones, that is, peaks and valleys are covered more efficiently than saddles.</p>

These textures mimic quite closely the dendritic thermomagnetic flux avalanches that penetrate the Nb layer from its edges. For low cobalt thickness, the filamentary magnetic textures occur in pairs with opposite polarity. The previous in-plane magnetization determines the relative location of the magnetic filaments with respect to the avalanche position.

            <p>The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended $s$-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. Essentially the initial single band is divided into number of sub-bands. If the chemical potential lies inside the energy gaps (sub-bands) then the phase is topologically trivial (non trivial). This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. The emergence of sub-bands allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed. We also discuss how in-plane magnetic field can be used to control the RSOC coupling and induced periodicity in depleted InAs nanowire in which evidence of strong electron-electron correlation has been found.</p>

            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two opposite values at Poisson-distributed times. The position of the particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations for the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The conditional average of the first-passage time at the origin over the trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the mean first-return time to the origin coincides with the value obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.</p>

Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system.

We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically, and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the transition probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. We further establish a threshold cheating probability at which cheaters collectively possess half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.</p>

            <p>Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</p>

The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects.

In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</p>

            <h2>Duality breaking, mobility edges, and the connection between topological Aubry-André and quantum Hall insulators in atomic wires with fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bar Alluf, C. A. R. Sa de Melo</p>
            <p>It is well known that the Aubry-Andr{é} model lacks mobility edges due to its energy-independent self-duality but may exhibit edge states. When duality is broken, we show that mobility regions arise and non-trivial topological phases emerge. By varying the degree of duality breaking, we identify mobility regions and establish a connection between Aubry-Andr{é} atomic wires with fermions and quantum Hall systems for a family of Hamiltonians that depends on the relative phase of laser fields, viewed as a synthetic dimension. Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of non-trivial phases: conventional topological insulator, conventional topological Aubry-Andr{é} insulator, and unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-Andr{é} insulator. Finally, we discuss appropriate Chern numbers that illustrate the classification of topological phases of localized fermions in atomic wires.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle and phonon dynamics are central to the operation of many superconducting devices. Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. In contrast to previous models of superconducting devices, our ab initio approach is capable of making predictions of device performance without experimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device development. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory of superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications. Although we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.</p>

            <p>Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</p>

            <p>Moire patterns in van der Waals bilayer materials complicate the analysis of atomic-resolution images, hindering the atomic-scale insight typically attainable with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we report a method to detect the positions and identities of atoms in each of the individual layers that compose twisted bilayer heterostructures. We developed a deep learning model, Gomb-Net, which identifies the coordinates and atomic species in each layer, effectively deconvoluting the moire pattern. This enables layer-specific mapping of quantities like strain and dopant distributions, unlike other commonly used segmentation models which struggle with moire-induced complexity. Using this approach, we explored the Se atom substitutional site distribution in a twisted fractional Janus WS2-WS2(1-x)Se2x heterostructure and found that layer-specific implantation sites are unaffected by the moire pattern's local energetic or electronic modulation. This advancement enables atom identification within material regimes where it was not possible before, opening new insights into previously inaccessible material physics.</p>

            <h2>Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small world networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davi Arrais Nobre, Karen C. Abbott, Jonathan Machta, Alan Hastings</p>
            <p>Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.</p>

            <p>Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</p>

            <p>Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</p>

            <h2>Global Anomalies on the Hilbert Space</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Delmastro, Davide Gaiotto, Jaume Gomis</p>
            <p>We show that certain global anomalies can be detected in an elementary fashion by analyzing the way the symmetry algebra is realized on the torus Hilbert space of the anomalous theory. Distinct anomalous behaviours imprinted in the Hilbert space are identified with the distinct cohomology "layers" that appear in the classification of anomalies in terms of cobordism groups. We illustrate the manifestation of the layers in the Hilbert for a variety of anomalous symmetries and spacetime dimensions, including time-reversal symmetry, and both in systems of fermions and in anomalous topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 2+1d. We argue that anomalies can imply an exact bose-fermi degeneracy in the Hilbert space, thus revealing a supersymmetric spectrum of states; we provide a sharp characterization of when this phenomenon occurs and give nontrivial examples in various dimensions, including in strongly coupled QFTs. Unraveling the anomalies of TQFTs leads us to develop the construction of the Hilbert spaces, the action of operators and the modular data in spin TQFTs, material that can be read on its own.</p>

            <h2>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan K. Taylor, Ian P. McCulloch</p>
            <p>We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p>

Specifically, if $\mathcal{C}$ is Abelian, then $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. When the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. Multiple steady states arise if the number of bathes is less than the number of charges. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as an equilibrium steady state.</p>

Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</p>

The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free.

The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satori Tsuzuki</p>
            <p>Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</p>

            <p>We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant Förster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Quantum Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anubhav Srivastava, Stefan Birnkammer, GiBaik Sim, Michael Knap, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is an established method for characterizing molecules and has been proposed in the THz regime as a new tool for probing exotic excitations of quantum magnets; however, the precise nature of the coupling between pump field and spin degrees of freedom has remained unclear. Here, we develop a general response theory of 2DCS and show how magneto-electric as well as polarization couplings contribute to 2DCS in addition to the typically assumed magnetization. We propose experimental protocols to distill individual contributions, for instance from exchange-striction or spin current mechanism, when the electric field couples to terms quadratic in spin operators. We provide example calculations for the paradigmatic twisted Kitaev chain material $\mathrm{CoNb}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$ and highlight the crucial role of contributions from cross-coupling between polarization and magnetic nonlinear susceptibilities. Our work paves the way for systematic studies of light-matter couplings in quantum magnets and for establishing 2DCS as a versatile tool for probing fractional excitations of exotic magnetic quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Shining light on collective modes in moiré fractional Chern insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisarga Paul, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Aidan Reddy, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We show that collective excitations and optical responses of moiré fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) drastically differ from those of standard fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a Landau level. By constructing a variational wavefunction that incorporates the moiré lattice effect, we capture the collective modes in FCIs across a range of crystal momenta including the roton minimum. Interestingly, new collective modes -- ``fractional excitons'' -- are found in the long wavelength limit ($\boldsymbol{q} \rightarrow 0$) at low energy below the excitation continuum, distinct from the FQH case. Some of these modes are optically active and manifest as sharp peaks in optical conductivity at THz frequency. We further show that intraband optical absorption and spectral weight in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$ are highly tunable by the displacement field. Our work thus establishes optical spectroscopy as a powerful tool to illuminate the unique collective modes of moiré FCIs.</p>

            <h2>Theory of magnetoroton bands in moiré materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bishoy M. Kousa, Nicolás Morales-Durán, Tobias M. R. Wolf, Eslam Khalaf, Allan H. MacDonald</p>
            <p>The recent realizations of the Hofstadter butterfly and fractional Chern insulators in moiré materials have introduced a new ingredient, a periodic lattice potential, to the study of quantum Hall phases. While the fractionalized states in moiré systems are expected to be in the same universality class as their counterparts in Landau levels, the periodic potential can have qualitative and quantitative effects on physical observables. Here, we examine how the magnetoroton collective modes of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are altered by external periodic potentials. Employing a single-mode-approximation, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the low-energy neutral excitations expressed in terms of three-point density correlation functions, which are computed using Monte Carlo. Our analysis is applicable to FQH states in graphene with a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate and also to fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We predict experimentally testable trends in the THz absorption characteristics of FCI and FQH states and estimate the external potential strength at which a soft-mode phase transition occurs between FQH and charge density wave (CDW) states.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Theory of Chern Polarization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thivan M. Gunawardana, Frank Schindler, Ari M. Turner, Ryan Barnett</p>
            <p>The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example since they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states, complicating the definition of polarization. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center is no longer gauge invariant. In this Letter, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations and it can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. Our result is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.</p>

            <h2>Controlling spin currents with magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet</h2>

            <p>Controlling spin current lies at the heart of spintronics and its applications. The sign of spin currents is monotonous in ferromagnets once the current direction is determined. Spin currents in antiferromagnets can possess opposite polarization, but requires enormous magnetic fields to lift the degeneracy. Controlling spin currents with different polarization is urgently demanded but remains hitherto elusive. Here, we demonstrate the control of spin currents at room temperature by magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet, hematite recently also classified as an altermagnet. Magneto-optical characterization by Brillouin light scattering revealed that the spatial periodicity of the beating patterns was tunable via the microwave frequency. The inverse spin-Hall voltage changed sign as the frequency was scanned, i.e., a frequency-controlled switching of polarization in pure spin currents was obtained. Our work marks the use of antiferromagnetic magnon interference to control spin currents, which substantially extends the horizon for the emerging field of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>The discovery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate thin films under ambient pressure provides an opportunity to directly investigate characteristic energy scales of the superconducting state from electronic structure. Here, we successfully probe the energy gap and dispersion renormalization in one unit-cell La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates, by developing an ultra-high vacuum quenching technique for in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The energy gap is observed on the underlying Fermi surface without showing a node along the Brillouin zone diagonal. This gap exhibits particle-hole symmetric behavior and persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the existence of a pseudogap. An abrupt band renormalization is observed with a dispersion anomaly at ~70 meV below Fermi level, pointing to another energy scale besides the energy gap. These observations provide initial information on fundamental properties of the superconducting state in bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</p>

            <h2>Breathing ferroelectricity induced topological valley states in kagome niobium halide monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Qi Wang, Jun-Ding Zheng, Wen-Yi Tong, Chun-Gang Duan</p>
            <p>In recent years, kagome lattices have garnered significant attention for their diverse properties in topology, magnetism, and electron correlations. However, the exploration of breathing kagome lattices, which exhibit dynamic breathing behavior, remains relatively scarce. Structural breathing introduces an additional degree of freedom that is anticipated to fine-tune the electronic structure, potentially leading to exotic properties within the system. In this study, we employ a combination of the kp model and first-principles calculations to explore how breathing ferroelectricity can modulate valley states within a monolayer of niobium halide with breathing kagome lattice. Through the interplay of magnetoelectric coupling and the lock-in between breathing and ferroelectric states, we demonstrate that a dynamically breathing process, when controlled by an appropriately applied electric field, can achieve valley polarization reversal and generate multiple valley states, including those that are topologically nontrivial. These state transformations may couple to distinctive properties in circularly-polarized optical responses and various valley Hall effects. Consequently, our results suggest that materials featuring breathing kagome lattices represent promising platforms for studying the interplay among structure, charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom, a crucial step toward developing multifunctional devices.</p>

            <h2>Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Eyal, Gad Koren</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. The specific phase responsible for these notable effects was not yet identified, and further research is needed in order to identify and isolate the relevant phase.</p>

            <h2>Surface acoustic wave driven acoustic spin splitter in d-wave altermagnetic thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter M. Gunnink, Jairo Sinova, Alexander Mook</p>
            <p>The generation of spin currents is a key challenge in the field of spintronics. We propose using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to generate spin currents in altermagnetic thin films, thereby realizing an acoustic spin splitter. Altermagnets, characterized by spin-polarized electrons and magnons, provide a versatile platform where SAWs can drive spin currents carried by both charge carriers and magnons. This acoustic spin splitter can be implemented in both metallic and insulating altermagnetic thin films, offering broad material applicability and a novel way to detect the spin splitter effect in insulating altermagnetic thin film. We examine a realistic experimental setup where a heavy metal layer, such as platinum, is used to convert the spin current into a measurable charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect. For representative material parameters, we calculate the expected spin current and the corresponding inverse spin Hall voltage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tuning the SAW frequency allows for precise control over the spin current, highlighting the versatility and potential of the acoustic spin splitter for future spintronics applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas K. König, Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>Layered 2D organic-inorganic perovskite semiconductors support strongly confined excitons that offer significant potential for ultrathin polaritonic devices due to their tunability and huge oscillator strength. The application of a magnetic field has proven to be an invaluable tool for investigating the exciton fine structure observed in these materials. Yet, the combination of an in-plane magnetic field and the strong coupling regime has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we combine microscopic theory with a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations to model the magneto-optics of exciton polaritons in 2D perovskites. We predict that the brightened dark exciton state can enter the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, the magnetic-field-induced mixing of polarization selection rules and the breaking of in-plane symmetry lead to highly anisotropic polariton branches. This study contributes to a better understanding of the exciton fine structure in 2D perovskites and demonstrates the cavity control of highly anisotropic and polarization-sensitive exciton polaritons.</p>

            <p>Interfacial superconductivity discovered in bilayer nickelate heterostructures opens new avenues for effective tunability and control. Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level. Our findings establish an element- and orbital-resolved electronic framework for the origin of superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng-Jie Guo, Xiao-Yao Hou, Ze-Feng Gao, Huan-Cheng Yang, Wei Ji, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic materials, with real-space antiferromagnetic arrangement and reciprocal-space anisotropic spin splitting, have attracted much attention. However, the spin splitting is small in most altermagnetic materials, which is a disadvantage to their application in electronic devices. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict for the first time two Luttinger compensated bipolarized magnetic semiconductors Mn(CN)2 and Co(CN)2 with isotropic spin splitting as in the ferromagnetic materials. Our further analysis shows that the Luttinger compensated magnetism here depends not only on spin group symmetry, but also on the crystal field splitting and the number of d-orbital electrons. In addition, the polarized charge density indicates that both Mn(CN)2 and Co(CN)2 have the quasi-symmetry T{\tau} , resulting from the crystal field splitting and the number of d-orbital electrons. The Luttinger compensated magnetism not only has the zero total magnetic moment as the antiferromagnetism, but also has the isotropic spin splitting as the ferromagnetism, thus our work not only provides theoretical guidance for searching Luttinger compensated magnetic materials with distinctive properties, but also provides a material basis for the application in spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Coexisting Triferroic and Multiple Types of Valley Polarization by Structural Phase Transition in Two-Dimensional Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Wu, Hanbo Sun, Pengqiang Dong, Yin-Zhong Wu, Ping Li</p>
            <p>The multiferroic materials, which coexist magnetism, ferroelectric, and ferrovalley, have broad practical application prospects in promoting the miniaturization and integration of spintronic and valleytronic devices. However, it is rare that there are triferroic orders and multiple types of valley polarization in a real material. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize triferroic order coexistence and multiple types of valley polarization by structural phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) materials. The 1T and 2H phase OsBr2 monolayers exhibit non-magnetic semiconductor and ferromagnetic semiconductor with valley polarization up to 175.49 meV, respectively. Interestingly, the 1T phase OsBr2 bilayer shows the tri-state valley polarization due to lattice symmetry breaking, while the valley polarization of 2H phase bilayer originates from the combined effect of time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, the valley polarization and ferroelectric polarization of 1T phase AB stackings and 2H phase AA stackings can be manipulated via interlayer sliding. Importantly, we have verified that the 2H phase can be transformed to 1T phase by Li+ ion intercalation, while the 2H phase can occur the structural phase transition into the 1T phase by infrared laser induction. Our work provides a feasible strategy for manipulating valley polarization and a design idea for nano-devices with nonvolatile multiferroic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi-guang Wang, Guang-hua Guo, Jamal Berakdar, Hui Jing</p>
            <p>Low energy excitations of a magnetically ordered system are spin waves with magnon being their excitation quanta. Magnons are demonstrated to be useful for data processing and communication. To achieve magnon transport across extended distances, it is essential to minimize magnonic dissipation which can be accomplished by material engineering to reduce intrinsic damping or by spin torques that can counteract damping. This study introduces an alternative methodology to effectively reduce magnon dissipation based on magnonic bound states in the continuum (BIC). We demonstrate the approach for two antiferromagnetically coupled magnonic waveguides, with one waveguide being attached to a current carrying metallic layer. The current acts on the attached waveguide with a spin-orbit torque effectively amplifying the magnonic signal. The setup maps on a non-Hermitian system with coupled loss and more loss, enabling the formation of dissipationless magnon BIC. We investigate the necessary criteria for the formation of magnon BIC through electric currents. The influences of interlayer coupling constant, anisotropy constants and applied magnetic field on the current-induced magnon BIC are analyzed. The identified effect can be integrated in the design of magnon delay lines, offering opportunities for the enhancement of magnonic devices and circuits.</p>

The RIXS spectrum of Ba3InIr2O9 at the Ir L3 edge possesses several sharp features below 2 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir tg levels. The excitation located from 2 to 5 eV is due to tg -> eg transitions. The third wide structure situated at 5-12 eV appears due to charge transfer transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $ν{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ajit C. Balram, Anirban Sharma, J. K. Jain</p>
            <p>Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.</p>

We identify the conditions necessary for ordered, pure-phase growth of single to triple {\beta}-antimonene bilayers. Additionally, we determine their electronic structure, work function, and characteristic core-level binding energies, offering an explanation for the relatively large chemical shifts observed among the different phases. This study not only establishes a protocol for achieving a single {\beta} phase of antimonene but also provides key signatures for distinguishing between the different allotropes using standard spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.</p>

By measuring the diffuse scattering from a surface after an ultrafast optical excitation, we determined the dispersion relation of surface acoustic wave-packets across a broad range of wavevectors in various samples. The comparison of the signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies suggests that the underlying excitation mechanism is related to the natural roughness of the samples surface. This simple and contactless approach represents a complementary experimental tool to transient grating or Brillouin spectroscopy, providing valuable insights into nanoscale surface dynamics.</p>

            <p>We present a methodology for designing a generalized dual potential, or pseudo potential, for inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (iCANNs). This potential, expressed in terms of stress invariants, inherently satisfies thermodynamic consistency for large deformations. In comparison to our previous work, the new potential captures a broader spectrum of material behaviors, including pressure-sensitive inelasticity. To this end, we revisit the underlying thermodynamic framework of iCANNs for finite strain inelasticity and derive conditions for constructing a convex, zero-valued, and non-negative dual potential. To embed these principles in a neural network, we detail the architecture's design, ensuring a priori compliance with thermodynamics. To evaluate the proposed architecture, we study its performance and limitations discovering visco-elastic material behavior, though the method is not limited to visco-elasticity. In this context, we investigate different aspects in the strategy of discovering inelastic materials. Our results indicate that the novel architecture robustly discovers interpretable models and parameters, while autonomously revealing the degree of inelasticity.

            <p>The paper presents an innovative methodology for designing frequency selective surface (FSS) based radar absorbing materials using machine learning (ML) technique. In conventional electromagnetic design, unit cell dimensions of FSS are used as input and absorption coefficient is then predicted for a given design. In this paper, absorption coefficient is considered as input to ML model and image of FSS unit cell is predicted. Later, this image is used for generating the FSS unit cell parameters. Eleven different ML models are studied over a wide frequency band of 1GHz to 30GHz. Out of which six ML models (i.e. (a) Random Forest classification, (b) K- Neighbors Classification, (c) Grid search regression, (d) Random Forest regression, (e) Decision tree classification, and (f) Decision tree regression) show training accuracy more than 90%. The absorption coefficients with varying frequencies of these predicted images are subsequently evaluated using commercial electromagnetic solver. The performance of these ML models is encouraging, and it can be used for accelerating design and optimization of high performance FSS based radar absorbing material for advanced electromagnetic applications in future.</p>

Due to the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</p>

            <h2>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</p>

            <h2>Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergoditicy in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Rubem Mondaini, Marcos Rigol</p>
            <p>We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasi-conserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing transition to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the transitions.</p>

            <h2>Wind-driven collisions between floes explain the observed dispersion of Arctic sea ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryan Shaddy, P. Alex Greaney, Bhargav Rallabandi</p>
            <p>The transport of sea ice over the polar oceans plays an important role in climate. This transport is driven predominantly by turbulent winds, leading to stochastic motion of ice floes. Observed diffusivities and velocity distributions of sea ice deviate by orders of magnitude from Brownian models, making it challenging to predict ice transport. We fully resolve these gaps through stochastic granular simulations that account for interactions between ice floes as they respond to a noisy wind. Using only directly measured quantities as model inputs, we reproduce the dispersion, diffusivity, velocity distribution, and power spectra of sea ice observed in the Fram Strait with remarkable quantitative accuracy. We understand these features as direct consequences of collisions between floes, which rapidly dissipate the energy injected by wind. A kinetic theory provides insights into these dynamics in terms of environmental properties, and makes predictions in close agreement with observations. The ideas and tools developed here pave the way for a new predictive understanding of global sea ice transport in terms of local floe-scale processes.</p>

            <p>We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</p>

            <p>The emergence of planar meta-lenses on flexible materials has profoundly impacted the long-standing perception of diffractive optics. Despite their advantages, these lenses still face challenges in design and fabrication to obtain high focusing efficiency and resolving power. A nanofabrication technique is demonstrated based on photolithography and polyimide casting for realizing membrane-based multilevel phase-type Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) with high focusing efficiency. By employing advantageous techniques, these lenses with nanostructures are directly patterned into thin polyimide membranes. The computational and experimental results have indicated that the focusing efficiency of these nanostructures at the primary focus increases significantly with increasing the number of phase levels. Specifically, 16-level phase lenses on a polyimide membrane can achieve a focusing efficiency of more than 91.6% of the input signal (9.5 times better than that of a conventional amplitude-type FZP) and focus light into a diffraction-limited spot together with very weak side-lobes. Furthermore, these lenses exhibit considerably reduced unwanted diffraction orders and produce extremely low background signals. The potential impact of these lenses extends across various applications and techniques including microscopy, imaging, micro-diffraction, remote sensing, and space flight instruments which require lightweight and flexible configurations.</p>

            <p>We analyze the steady-state characteristics of a damped harmonic oscillator (system) in presence of a non-Markovian bath characterized by Lorentzian spectral density. Although Markovian baths presume memoryless dynamics, the introduction of complex temporal connections by a non-Markovian environment radically modifies the dynamics of the system and its steady-state behaviour. We obtain the steady-state Green's functions and correlation functions of the system using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In both rotating and non-rotating wave approximation, we analyzed various emergent properties like effective temperature and distribution function. We also explore the impact of dissipation and non-Markovian bath on the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects. We show that a transition between Zeno to anti-Zeno effect can be tuned by bath spectral width and the strength of dissipation.</p>

            <p>Divertor designs involving liquid lithium have been proposed as an alternative to solid designs and wall conditioning techniques. However, Li affinity with tritium poses a risk for the fuel cycle. This study investigates deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak, making for the first time a direct comparison between Li-D co-deposits and pre-deposited Li films. Samples were exposed to H-mode plasmas in the far scrape-off layer (SOL), and Li powder was injected in-situ with the impurity powder dropper to study the uniformity of Li coatings, and the dependence of fuel retention on Li thickness. The results show that at temperatures below the melting point of lithium, deuterium retention is independent of the thickness of pre-deposited Li layers, with Li-D co-deposits being the primary factor for fuel retention. Both pre-deposited and in-situ deposited Li showed lower erosion than predicted by sputtering yield calculations. These results suggest that fuel retention in fusion reactors using lithium in the divertor will likely be dominated by co-deposits rather than in the divertor itself. If one desires to use Li to achieve flatter temperature profiles, operando Li injection is advantageous over pre-deposited Li films, at least at temperatures below the melting point of lithium.</p>

Strong and weak notions of erasure are distinguished according to whether the single erasure procedure does or does not leave the environment in the same state independently of the pre-erasure state. 2. Purely thermodynamic considerations show that strong erasure cannot be dissipationless. 3. The main source of entropy creation in erasure processes at molecular scales is the entropy that must be created to suppress thermal fluctuations ("noise"). 4. A phase space analysis recovers no minimum entropy cost for weak erasure and a positive minimum entropy cost for strong erasure. 5. An information entropy term has been attributed mistakenly to pre-erasure states in the Gibbs formalism through the neglect of an additive constant in the "-k sum p log p" Gibbs entropy formula.</p>

            <p>Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, garnering decades of investment in high quality materials and devices. Electron spin systems in semiconductors, including atomic defects and quantum dots, have been demonstrated in the last two decades to host quantum coherent spin qubits, often with coherent spin-photon interfaces and proximal nuclear spins. These systems are at the center of developing quantum technology. However, new material challenges arise when considering the isotopic composition of host and qubit systems. The isotopic composition governs the nature and concentration of nuclear spins, which naturally occur in leading host materials. These spins generate magnetic noise -- detrimental to qubit coherence -- but also show promise as local quantum memories and processors, necessitating careful engineering dependent on the targeted application. Reviewing recent experimental and theoretical progress towards understanding local nuclear spin environments in semiconductors, we show this aspect of material engineering as critical to quantum information technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick A. D. Omar, Zachary G. Lipel, Kranthi K. Mandadapu</p>
            <p>This article is the second of a three-part series that derives a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of arbitrarily curved lipid membranes. Existing continuum theories commonly treat lipid membranes as strictly two-dimensional surfaces. While this approach is successful in many purely mechanical applications, strict surface theories fail to capture the electric potential drop across lipid membranes, the effects of surface charges, and electric fields within the membrane. Consequently, they do not accurately resolve Maxwell stresses in the interior of the membrane and its proximity. Furthermore, surface theories are generally unable to capture the effects of distinct velocities and tractions at the interfaces between lipid membranes and their surrounding bulk fluids. To address these shortcomings, we apply a recently proposed dimension reduction method to the three-dimensional, electromechanical balance laws. This approach allows us to derive an effective surface theory without taking the limit of vanishing thickness, thus incorporating effects arising from the finite thickness of lipid membranes. We refer to this effective surface theory as $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the thickness. The resulting $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional equations of motion satisfy velocity and traction continuity conditions at the membrane-bulk interfaces, capture the effects of Maxwell stresses, and can directly incorporate three-dimensional constitutive models.</p>

            <p>Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</p>

            <p>The heavy-holes in Ge/GeSi heterostructures show highly anisotropic gyromagnetic response with in-plane $g$-factors $g_{x,y}^*\lesssim 0.3$ and out-of-plane $g$-factor $g_z^*\gtrsim 10$. As a consequence, Rabi hot spots and dephasing sweet lines are extremely sharp and call for a careful alignment of the magnetic field in Ge spin qubit devices. We investigate how the $g$-factors can be engineered by strains. We show that uniaxial strains can raise in-plane $g$-factors above unity while leaving $g_z^*$ essentially constant. We discuss how the etching of an elongated mesa in a strained buffer can actually induce uniaxial (but inhomogeneous) strains in the heterostructure. This broadens the operational magnetic field range and enables spin manipulation by shuttling holes between neighboring dots with different $g$-factors.</p>

This study demonstrates AOS in NCO thin films at room temperature using long-duration laser pulses and high repetition rates.

Consequently, two distinct types of AOS can be observed in a single NCO thin film, contingent on the characteristics of the laser pulses and temperature.</p>

These structures are confirmed to have nonzero integer Chern numbers, indicating their topological nature. Moreover, the topological state is robust under moderate biaxial strains. Interestingly, applying compressive strain results in a high Chern number of 2 and enhances their magnetic stability at elevated temperatures.

The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy.

            <p>In recent years, studies have demonstrated that the grain boundary (GB) migration is a three-dimensional (3D) process, characterized by a 3D mobility tensor. In this study, we develop a 3D interface random walk theory to extract the GB mobility and shear coupling tensors at equilibrium state based on the random walk of the GB position. Using this approach, we mathematically prove the symmetry of the GB mobility tensor in the case of overdamped GB migration. The theory and its conclusions align with molecular dynamics simulation results and disconnection analysis, and the extracted GB mobility and shear coupling tensors reflect the intrinsic GB properties, unaffected by the large driving forces in atomistic simulations. Additionally, we refined the fast adapted random walk (FAIRWalk) method, enabling efficient extraction of the GB mobility tensor from fewer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. Building on this advancement, we conducted an extensive survey of the mobility, shear coupling, and activation energy for the migration of 388 coincidence-site lattice Ni GBs in the Olmsted database. Several intriguing phenomena were observed, including temperature-induced sudden emergence, disappearance, or inversion of shear coupling; GBs with "zero" normal mobility but high shear mobility; and a non-linear relationship between activation energy and mobility. These findings challenge the traditional understanding of GB migration and warrant further investigation.</p>

            <p>We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the five-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.</p>

            <h2>Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito</p>
            <p>In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets are believed to host phases of matter whose excitations are more fundamental than those of the ordered phases. When combining two such spin systems in a bilayer, strong interaction between the emergent excitations can produce phases not realized in either of its subsystems. We show that the critical fluctuations of a two-dimensional spin liquid state can induce a deconfined quantum critical point in a proximate antiferromagnet. The most relevant coupling between the associated effective field theories is given by a mixed Chern-Simons term of the emergent gauge fields in each layer. This describes a topological current-current interaction. In contrast to the local spin-spin interaction, it strongly modifies the renormalization group flow of the theory describing the Néel-valence-bond-solid transition of the antiferromagnet. In particular, the protected coupling constant associated with it implies non-trivial quantum critical scaling characterized by a non-universal power-law divergence of the correlation length in the critical domain and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless divergence approaching it.</p>

            <p>This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the thermodynamic irreversibility of the original model and thus gives more accurate results than those using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual models roughly preserve the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.</p>

            <h2>The $(2+δ)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: III. Constitutive models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick A. D. Omar, Zachary G. Lipel, Kranthi K. Mandadapu</p>
            <p>This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory as $(2+\delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the membrane thickness. However, the $(2+\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.</p>

            <h2>The Rouse ring chain with attractive harmonic potential of spherical symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nail Fatkullin, Carlos Mattea, Kevin Lindt, Siegfried Stapf, Margarita Kruteva</p>
            <p>The static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the introduction of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature is studied. It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e. the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a pseudo-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared segmental displacement.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying the Complexity of Materials with Assembly Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keith Y Patarroyo, Abhishek Sharma, Ian Seet, Ignas Packmore, Sara I. Walker, Leroy Cronin</p>
            <p>Quantifying the evolution and complexity of materials is of importance in many areas of science and engineering, where a central open challenge is developing experimental complexity measurements to distinguish random structures from evolved or engineered materials. Assembly Theory (AT) was developed to measure complexity produced by selection, evolution and technology. Here, we extend the fundamentals of AT to quantify complexity in inorganic molecules and solid-state periodic objects such as crystals, minerals and microprocessors, showing how the framework of AT can be used to distinguish naturally formed materials from evolved and engineered ones by quantifying the amount of assembly using the assembly equation defined by AT. We show how tracking the Assembly of repeated structures within a material allows us formalizing the complexity of materials in a manner accessible to measurement. We confirm the physical relevance of our formal approach, by applying it to phase transformations in crystals using the HCP to FCC transformation as a model system. To explore this approach, we introduce random stacking faults in closed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how Assembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of closed-packed structures with random or engineered faults, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing engineered materials from randomly structured ones. Our results have implications for the study of pre-genetic minerals at the origin of life, optimization of material design in the trade-off between complexity and function, and new approaches to explore material technosignatures which can be unambiguously identified as products of engineered design.</p>

            <p>Forming long wavelength moiré superlattices (MSL) at small-angle twist van der Waals (vdW) bilayers has been a key approach to creating moiré flat bands. The small-angle twist, however, leads to strong lattice reconstruction, causing domain walls and moiré disorders, which pose considerable challenges in engineering such platforms. At large twist angles, the rigid lattices render a more robust, but shorter wavelength MSL, making it difficult to engineer flat bands. Here, we depict a novel approach to tailoring robust super-moiré (SM) structures that combines the advantages of both small-twist and large-twist transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) bilayers using only a single twist angle near a commensurate angle. Structurally, we unveil the spontaneous formation of a periodic arrangement of three inequivalent commensurate moiré (CM) stacking, where the angle deviation from the commensurate angle can tune the periodicity. Electronically, we reveal a large set of van Hove singularities (VHSs) that indicate strong band hybridization, leading to flat bands near the valence band maximum. Our study paves the way for a new platform of robust SM bilayers with structural rigidity and controllable wavelength, extending the investigation of the interplay among band topology, quantum geometry, and moiré superconductivity to the large twist angle regime.</p>

            <p>Topological Hall effect (THE), a quantum phenomenon arising from emergent magnetic field generated by topological spin texture, is a key method for detecting non-coplanar spin structures like skyrmions in magnetic materials. Here, we investigate a bilayer structure of Pt and conducting ferrimagnet NiCo2O4 (NCO) of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate giant THE across a temperature range 2 - 350 K. The absence of THE in single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small nucleation centers. This aligns with the unresolvable domain structures during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.</p>

            <p>Hair cells actively drive oscillations of their mechanosensitive organelles--the hair bundles that enable hearing and balance sensing in vertebrates. Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others--as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and, at the expense of external driving, as active feedback refrigerators. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work conversion by hair bundles, whose efficiency in some conditions exceeds 80 % of the applied power.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Dynamical Ising Transition in Diffusive Sandpiles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Makani, Morteza Nattagh Najafi</p>
            <p>Minimally stable site (MSS) clusters play a dominant role in shaping avalanches in the self-organized critical (SOC) systems. The manipulation of MSS clusters through local smoothings (diffusion) alter the MSS landscape, suppressing rare avalanches and postponing them until they manifest as spanning avalanches. By leveraging the Inverse Ising problem, we uncover a duality between diffusive sandpiles and equilibrium statistical physics. Our analysis reveals an emergent magnetic instability in the dual Ising model, coinciding with the formation of spanning avalanches and marking a transition to a correlated percolation regime. At this point, the MSS loop soups exhibit fractal self-similarity and power-law distributions, while the effective pairwise interactions in the dual system vanish, signaling a magnetic transition characterized by abrupt changes in magnetization and spin susceptibility. Crucially, we show that diffusion fundamentally reshapes avalanche dynamics: the spatial anti-correlations of MSSs in standard SOC systems transform into positive correlations when diffusion is introduced. These findings bridge self-organized criticality, percolation theory, and equilibrium phase transitions, shedding new light on emergent criticality and large-scale correlations in non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Particle geometry space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Tripathi, Seung Jae Lee</p>
            <p>Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chia-Ying Lin, Mei Ian Sam, Yi-Ching Tsai, Hsiu-Hau Lin</p>
            <p>In the past few decades, there have been intense debates whether the brain operates at a critical state. To verify the criticality hypothesis in the neuronal networks is challenging and the accumulating experimental and theoretical results remain controversial at this point. Here we simulate how visual information of a nature image is processed by the finite Kinouchi-Copelli neuronal network, extracting the trends of the mutual information (how sensible the neuronal network is), the dynamical range (how sensitive the network responds to external stimuli) and the statistical fluctuations (how criticality is defined in conventional statistical physics). It is rather remarkable that the optimized state for visual recognition, although close to, does not coincide with the critical state where the statistical fluctuations reach the maximum. Different images and/or network sizes of course lead to differences in details but the trend of the information optimization remains the same. Our findings pave the first step to investigate how the information processing is optimized in different neuronal networks and suggest that the criticality hypothesis may not be necessary to explain why a neuronal network can process information smartly.</p>

            <h2>Pump-efficient Josephson parametric amplifiers with high saturation power</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas M. Hougland, Zhuan Li, Ryan Kaufman, Boris Mesits, Roger S. K. Mong, Michael Hatridge, David Pekker</p>
            <p>Circuit QED based quantum information processing relies on low noise amplification for signal readout. In the realm of microwave superconducting circuits, this amplification is often achieved via Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA). In the past, these amplifiers exhibited low power added efficiency (PAE), which is roughly the fraction of pump power that is converted to output signal power. This is increasingly relevant because recent attempts to build high saturation power amplifiers achieve this at the cost of very low PAE, which in turn puts a high heat load on the cryostat and limits the number of these devices that a dilution refrigerator can host. Here, we numerically investigate upper bounds on PAE. We focus on a class of parametric amplifiers that consists of a capacitor shunted by a nonlinear inductive block. We first set a benchmark for this class of amplifiers by considering nonlinear blocks described by an arbitrary polynomial current-phase relation. Next, we propose two circuit implementations of the nonlinear block. Finally, we investigate chaining polynomial amplifiers. We find that while amplifiers with higher gain have a lower PAE, regardless of the gain there is considerable room to improve as compared to state of the art devices. For example, for a phase-sensitive amplifier with a power gain of 20 dB, the PAE is ~0.1% for typical JPAs, 5.9% for our simpler circuit JPAs, 34% for our more complex circuit JPAs, 48% for our arbitrary polynomial amplifiers, and at least 95% for our chained amplifiers.</p>

            <h2>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjeev Raja, Ishan Amin, Fabian Pedregosa, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. The stability improvements cannot be matched by reducing the simulation timestep; thus, StABlE Training effectively allows for larger timesteps. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets. Our code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashwin Murali, Tapomoy Guha Sarkar, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a spin-$1/2$ system, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the spin. We study the emergence of diabolical points and diabolical loci in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique for tuning the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting different adiabatic evolutions of the driving protocol, characterized by distinct paths in parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.</p>

            <p>Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David A. Herrera-Martí</p>
            <p>Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.</p>

            <p>We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potential in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.</p>

            <p>We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta<0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Lacerda-Santos, Xavier Waintal</p>
            <p>In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</p>

            <p>Fractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect were first observed via DC shot noise measurements of anyons tunneling at a quantum point contact (QPC). However, in scenarios with simultaneous tunneling of different types of charges at the QPC, the connection between DC shot noise and tunneling charge is less transparent. Photo-assisted shot noise (PASN), induced by periodic AC voltage, offers a promising alternative. Here, we investigate PASN in the hierarchical states of the fractional quantum Hall effect, where different types of charges are expected to tunnel concurrently at QPCs. In the particular case of the fractional quantum Hall state $\nu = 2/3$, our analysis demonstrates that PASN can be employed as a robust tool to detect different tunneling charges, even when the tunneling amplitude of one type is significantly smaller compared to the other. We show that the features predicted by our calculations are still visible for typical values of temperature and frequency achieved in state-of-the-art experiments. Our general formalism can be used to compute PASN for general Abelian quantum Hall systems with multiple edge modes and charge types.</p>

            <h2>$d$-Wave Polarization-Spin Locking in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Nikhil V. Medhekar</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of an uncharted phenomenon, termed $d$-wave polarization-spin locking (PSL), in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets. This phenomenon arises from nontrivial Berry connections, resulting in perpendicular electronic polarizations in the spin-up and spin-down channels. Symmetry-protected $d$-wave PSL occurs exclusively in $d$-wave altermagnets with tetragonal layer groups. To identify 2D altermagnets capable of exhibiting this phenomenon, we propose a symmetry-eigenvalue-based criterion, and a rapid method by observing the spin-momentum locking. Using first-principles calculations, monolayer Cr$_2$X$_2$O (X = Se, Te) characterizes promising candidates for $d$-wave PSL, driven by the unusual charge order in these monolayers. This unique polarization-spin interplay leads to spin-up and spin-down electrons accumulating at orthogonal edges, enabling potential applications as spin filters or splitters in spintronics. Furthermore, $d$-wave PSL introduces an unexpected spin-driven ferroelectricity in conventional antiferromagnets. Such magnetoelectric coupling positions $d$-wave PSL as an ideal platform for fast antiferromagnetic memory devices. Our findings not only expand the landscape of altermagnets, complementing conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, but also highlight tantalizing functionalities in altermagnetic materials, potentially revolutionizing information technology.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast optical control of ferroelectricity based on short and intense light can be utilized to achieve accurate manipulations of ferroelectric materials, which may pave a basis for future breakthrough in nonvolatile memories. Here, we demonstrate that phase manipulation of electric field in the strong field sub-cycle regime induces a nonlinear injection current, efficiently coupling with the topology of band structure and enabling dynamic reversal of both current and polarization. Our time-dependent first-principles calculations reveal that tuning the phase of linearly or circularly polarized light through time-varying chirp, or constant carrier envelop phases within sub-laser-cycle dynamics effectively breaks the time-reversal symmetry, allowing the control over current and electronic polarization reversal over multi-ferroelectric states. Our time- and momentum-resolved transverse current analysis reveal the significance of Berry curvature higher order poles in the apparent association between the odd (even) orders of Berry curvature multipoles to odd (even) pseudo-harmonics in driving polarization dynamics reversal. We suggest that these phase manipulations of short pulse waveform may lead to unprecedented accurate control of nonlinear photocurrents and polarization states, which facilitate the development of precise ultrafast opto-ferroelectric devices.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating Combinatorial Electrocatalyst Discovery with Bayesian Optimization: A Case Study in the Quaternary System Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Thelen, R. Zehl, R. Zerdoumi, J. L. Bürgel, L. Banko, W. Schuhmann, A. Ludwig</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Compositionally complex solid solutions comprising multiple metals offer promising catalytic properties, yet their exploration is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. In this work, we combine combinatorial sputtering of thin-film materials libraries and their high-throughput characterization with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the quaternary composition space Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Using this method, the global activity optimum of pure Ru was identified after covering less than 20% of the complete composition space with six materials libraries. Six additional libraries were fabricated to validate the activity trend. The resulting dataset is used to formulate general guidelines for the efficient composition space exploration using combinatorial synthesis paired with Bayesian optimization.</p>

            <h2>Geometric origin of supercurrents in Berry phase: Formula for computing currents from wavefunctions with correlation and particle number variation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Q. Song, J. D. H. Smith, J. Wang</p>
            <p>The complexity of itinerant and many-body nature in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunctions has traditionally led to the use of coarse-grained order parameters for describing currents in superconductors (SC), rather than directly utilizing wavefunctions. In this work, we introduce a phase-based formula that enables the direct computation of currents from microscopic wavefunctions, accounting for correlation and particle number variations. Interestingly, the formulation draws parallels with insulators, suggesting a unified framework for understanding (intra-band) charge transport across two extremes of conductivity. A group velocity current $J_{band}{\propto}\frac{1}{\hbar}{\partial}_kE(k)$ is derived from Berry phase, independent of wave package dynamics, robust against correlation. Additionally, we identify a correlation-driven contribution, $J_{corr}$, which reveals that the pairing correlations ${\langle}c_kc_{-k}{\rangle}$ among dancing partners provide a current component beyond the velocity operator.</p>

            <h2>Polarization of photoluminescence by optically driven orbital reconstruction in magnetically ordered CrCl3</h2>

            <p>In this paper, we show that photoluminescence from CrCl3 bulk crystal exhibits a preferential polarization direction when films are magnetically ordered or strained. We verify the magnetization as responsible for the polarization by measuring the signal as a function of the temperature in Voigt configuration while applying the in-plane magnetic field. We show that phonon coupling contributing to vibronic transitions depolarizes the signal compared with zero phonon lines. We explain the data using DFT calculations, which reveal a magnetization-selective occupation of the low energy d-orbital triplet state of Cr3+ upon photon absorption. In addition, the calculations find that the excitation of one electron results in the excited state acquiring out-of-plane components of spin and very large orbital magnetic moments, in addition to a lattice deformation.</p>

            <h2>Charge-state dependent spin-orbit coupling and quantum phase transitions in Ir-Ru oxides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuldeep Kargeti, Bidyut Mallick, Vladislav Borisov, Sk. Soyeb Ali, Johan Hellsvik, Olle Eriksson, S. K. Panda</p>
            <p>The competition between kinematic, relativistic and Coulombic interactions in iridium-based oxides has spurred intense experimental and theoretical investigations regarding the electronic structure and magnetism. We argue here that the Iridium-Ruthenium triple perovskites, Ba$_3$MRuIrO$_9$ (M = Li, Mg and In), are of particular interest in this regard. We show here, using ab-initio theory, that the nominal charge states of Ir can be tuned from +6 to +4 by choosing non-magnetic 'M' ions as Li (+1), Mg(+2) and In (+3). This variation modulates the influence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which is found here to be negligible in Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$, moderate in Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and determining in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. Our analysis classifies Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ as a band-insulator, Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ as a SOC and correlation driven insulator and Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ as $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ Mott-Hubbard insulator. As reported here, correlated electronic structure theory results in sizeable magnetic moments of both Ru and Ir atoms in these systems and atomistic spin-dynamics simulations capture the experimental Néel temperature for Ba$_3$LiRuIrO$_9$ and Ba$_3$MgRuIrO$_9$ and provide evidence for a phase transition for Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$ when T $\to$ 0 K, to a multi-valley magnetic state with strong magnetic frustration. The theory identifies the presence of Kitaev interaction among the iridium atoms in Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$. The realization of such strong anisotropic interactions helps to stabilize a particularly complex energy landscape of Ba$_3$InRuIrO$_9$, that opens up for exotic magnetic quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Perfect spin-triplet pairing in two-dimensional Ising superconductors purified by indirect excitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanyi Zhang, Yu Li, Ping Cui, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>Much research effort has been devoted to interfacial or two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, but the underlying pairing mechanisms and pairing symmetries are highly controversial in most cases. Here we propose an innovative approach to probe the pairing symmetry of 2D superconductors, based on a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of a prototypical 2D Ising superconductor coupled with a 2D hole gas through an insulating spacer. We first show that, by tuning the Coulomb attraction between the superconducting and hole layers, the gap of the corresponding indirect exciton insulators is tuned as well, resulting in contrasting manifestations of the distinct superconducting channels with spin-singlet (s-, extended s-, and d-wave) and spin-triplet (p- and f-wave) pairings. Strikingly, we find that the application of in-plane magnetic fields can suppress all other channels while selecting the spin-triplet p-wave channel to be the pure superconducting state, thus providing an ideal and practical platform for realizing highly desirable topological superconductivity. Such an approach can also be readily extended to other types of superconducting systems, offering unprecedented opportunities to probe the microscopic mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Quantum metric non-linear Hall effect in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin-film EuSn2As2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hung-Ju Tien, Hsin Lin, Liang Fu, Tay-Rong Chang</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric structure of electrons introduces fundamental insights into understanding quantum effects in materials. One notable manifestation is the non-linear Hall effect (NLHE), which has drawn considerable interest for its potential to overcome the intrinsic limitations of semiconductor diodes at low input power and high frequency. In this study, we investigate NLHE stemming from the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, specifically the quantum metric, in an antiferromagnetic topological material, EuSn2As2, using density functional theory. Our calculations predict a remarkable NLHE arising from a symmetry-protected, single Type-II surface Dirac cone in the even-numbered-layer two-dimensional slab thin-film, yielding a non-linear Hall conductivity exceeding 20 mA/V2-an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. This single Dirac band dispersion represents the simplest model for generating NLHE, positioning the EuSn2As2 thin-film as a hydrogen atom for NLHE systems. Additionally, we observe NLHE from band-edge states near the Fermi level. Our findings also reveal that 30% phosphorus (P) doping can double the non-linear Hall conductivity. With its substantial and tunable NLHE, EuSn2As2 thin-films present promising applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics and rectification devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of novel high-temperature superconductor materials holds transformative potential for a wide array of technological applications. However, the combinatorially vast chemical and configurational search space poses a significant bottleneck for both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this study, we employ the design of high-temperature ternary superhydride superconductors as a representative case to demonstrate how this challenge can be well addressed through a deep-learning-driven theoretical framework. This framework integrates high-throughput crystal structure exploration, physics-informed screening, and accurate prediction of superconducting critical temperatures. Our approach enabled the exploration of approximately 36 million ternary hydride structures across a chemical space of 29 elements, leading to the identification of 144 potential high-Tc superconductors with predicted Tc > 200 K and superior thermodynamic stability at 200 GPa. Among these, 129 compounds spanning 27 novel structural prototypes are reported for the first time, representing a significant expansion of the known structural landscape for hydride superconductors. This work not only greatly expands the known repertoire of high-Tc hydride superconductors but also establishes a scalable and efficient methodology for navigating the complex landscape of multinary hydrides.</p>

            <h2>Spin-charge Kondo effect for a quantum dot with side coupled Majorana zero mode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haojie Shen, Wei Su, Mengnan Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate a minimal system consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a Majorana zero mode and a normal lead. We identify the underlying screening process as a novel spin-charge Kondo effect, where the low-energy spin and charge degrees of freedom of the Majorana zero mode-quantum dot subsystem are fully screened by those in the normal lead, resulting in the formation of a spin-charge singlet. An effective low-energy model is derived, with charge fluctuations appropriately accounted for. This spin-charge Kondo effect is found to be consistent with the spin-dependent Andreev/normal boundary conditions induced by the Majorana zero mode. We demonstrate that the anomalous substructure in the spectrum and thermodynamic properties is closely tied to the proportion of the charge component in the screening cloud. The spin-charge screening cloud exhibits scaling behavior analogous to that of traditional Kondo systems, though the sub-leading even-odd effect is subtly modified by the boundary conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of Kondo physics and resolve key debates on quantum dot nanostructures with Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <h2>Localized Radiofrequency Heating for Enhanced Thermoelectric Energy Generation Using Natural Galena Ore</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karthik R, Yiwen Zheng, Rajesh Kumar Sahu, Punathil Raman Sreeram, Soma Banik, Aniruddh Vashisth, Chandra Sekhar Tiwary</p>
            <p>The efficiency of thermoelectric devices can be significantly enhanced by maintaining a stable temperature gradient, which can be achieved through localized heating. Radio waves serve as an ideal heat source for this purpose. In this study, we demonstrate the enhancement of thermoelectric performance in earth-abundant natural ore Galena (PbS) through localized radio frequency (RF) heating. RF heating experiments conducted at frequencies between \SI{35}{MHz} and \SI{45}{MHz} induced substantial localized heating in PbS, generating a temperature gradient of \SI{32}{K}. This resulted in a Seebeck voltage of \SI{-5.8}{mV/K}, approximately 13 times greater than the conventional Seebeck coefficient of PbS (\SI{440}{\micro V/K}). Additionally, a power factor of \SI{151}{mWm^{-1}K^{-2}} and an overall RF to thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 15\% were achieved. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the experimental findings, providing insights into the mechanism of thermal transport and RF-induced heating in PbS. These results highlight the potential of localized RF heating as an effective strategy for enhancing thermoelectric performance, with promising implications for ambient thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.</p>

            <h2>Carrier Emission and Capture Competition mediated A(n)BC Recombination Model in Semiconductors with Multi-Level Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanshan Wang, Menglin Huang, Su-Huai Wei, Xin-Gao Gong, Shiyou Chen</p>
            <p>The ABC model has been widely used to describe the carrier recombination rate, in which the rate of non-radiative recombination assisted by deep-level defects is assumed to depend linearly on excess carrier density $\Delta n$, leading to a constant recombination coefficient A. However, for multi-level defects that are prevalent in semiconductors, we demonstrate here that the rate should depend nonlinearly on $\Delta n$. When $\Delta n$ varies, the carrier capture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in different charge states, which can further change the carrier capture and emission rates of the defects and thus make the recombination rate depend non-linearly on $\Delta n$, leading to an $A(n)$ function. However, in many recent calculation studies on carrier recombination rate of multi-level defects, only carrier capture was considered while carrier emission from defect levels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and misleading linear dependence of the rate on $\Delta n$. For $\text{V}_{\text{Ga}}$-$\text{O}_{\text{N}}$ in GaN and $\text{Pb}_\text{I}$ in CsPbI$_3$, our calculations showed that neglecting the carrier emission can cause the recombination rate underestimation by more than 8 orders of magnitude when $\Delta n$ is $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our findings suggest that the recent studies on carrier recombination assisted by multi-level defects should be revisited with carrier emission considered, and the widely-used $ABC$ model should be reformed into the $A(n)BC$ model.</p>

            <p>In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weitao Chen, Ignacio García-Mata, John Martin, Jiangbin Gong, Bertrand Georgeot, Gabriel Lemarié</p>
            <p>The Anderson transition on random graphs draws interest through its resemblance to the many-body localization (MBL) transition with similarly debated properties. In this Letter, we construct a unitary Anderson model on Small-World graphs to characterize long time and large size wave-packet dynamics across the Anderson transition. We reveal the logarithmically slow non-ergodic dynamics in the critical regime, confirming recent random matrix predictions. Our data clearly indicate two localization times: an average localization time that diverges, while the typical one saturates. In the delocalized regime, the dynamics are initially non-ergodic but cross over to ergodic diffusion at long times and large distances. Finite-time scaling then allows us to characterize the critical dynamical properties: the logarithm of the average localization time diverges algebraically, while the ergodic time diverges exponentially. Our results could be used to clarify the dynamical properties of MBL and could guide future experiments with quantum simulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Lombardo, Imam Makhfudz, Steffen Schäfer, Roland Hayn</p>
            <p>We propose a nanoscale device consisting of a double quantum dot with a full exchange and pair hopping interaction. In this design, the current can only flow through the upper dot, but is sensitive to the spin state of the lower dot. The system is immersed in a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field, and only the bottom dot feels a substantial magnetic field, while the top dot experiences only a residual one. We show that our device exhibits very interesting magnetic field-dependent transport properties at low temperatures. The Kondo effect partially survives the presence of the magnetic field and allows to obtain conductances that differ by several orders of magnitude for the two spin types across the top dot. Interestingly, as a function of the magnetic field, our two-dot device changes from a spin singlet state to a spin triplet state, in which the amplitudes of the spin-dependent conductances are reversed. Our device is able to discriminate between positive and negative magnetic fields with a high sensitivity and is therefore particularly interesting for imaging the surface of anti-ferromagnetic (AF) insulating materials with alternated surface magnetic field, as well as for spin filtering applications.</p>

            <p>A pair of Weyl points (WPs) with opposite Chern numbers ${\cal{C}}$ can exhibit an additional higher-order $Z_2$ topological charge, giving rise to the formation of a $Z_2$ Weyl dipole. Owing to the nontrivial topological charge, $Z_2$ Weyl dipoles should also appear in pairs, and the WPs within each $Z_2$ Weyl dipole can not be annihilated when meeting together. As a novel topological state, the topological Weyl-dipole phase (TWDP) has garnered significant attention, yet its realization in crystalline materials remains a challenge. Here, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence of the Weyl-dipole phase in the phonon spectra of the $P6_3$ type Y(OH)$_3$. Particularly, the Weyl dipole in this system is protected by a quantized quadrupole moment, and it distinguished from conventional Weyl dipole, as it comprises an unconventional charge-3 WP with ${\cal{C}}=-3$ and three conventional charge-1 WPs with ${\cal{C}}=1$. Consequently, the Weyl-dipole phase in Y(OH)$_3$ features unique two-dimensional (2D) sextuple-helicoid Fermi-arc states on the top and bottom surfaces, protected by the Chern number, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hinge states that connect the two Weyl dipoles along the side hinges, guaranteed by the quantized quadrupole moment. Our findings not only introduce a novel higher-order topological phase, but also promote Y(OH)$_3$ as a promising platform for exploring multi-dimensional boundaries and the interaction between first-order and second-order topologies.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in the investigations of the charge role in semiconductor surfaces is reviewed. This is based on ab intio investigations. That include elucidation of Coulomb interaction of the separated subsystems, such as slab copies or far distant adsorbate and the slab, the bonding in the bulk and on the surface, standard and resonant. The quantum nature of the bonding leads to emergence of the external surface dipole, which was well recognized prior to these investigations. The role of the external dipole layer in the thermalization of the adsorbate is proposed and formulated. The internal dipole charge well known to exist at the surface were supplemented by new finding including the simulation of these dipole fields within slab model, pinning the Fermi level at the surface and the role of bulk and surface charge. of the bonding states. This could also occur at the activated complex point where the energy of these states could be increased into the vicinity of Fermi level or even higher so that this affects the energy barrier for diffusion. Therefore the explicit incorporation of quantum effects in the charge role in the semiconductor surfaces changes their properties considerably as described in this review.</p>

            <p>Driven systems offer the potential to realize a wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena that are inaccessible in static systems, such as the discrete time crystals. Time rondeau crystals with a partial temporal order have been proposed as a distinctive prethermal phase of matter in systems driven by structured random protocols. Yet, heating is inevitable in closed systems and time rondeau crystals eventually melt. We introduce dissipation to counteract heating and demonstrate stable time rondeau crystals, which persist indefinitely, in a many-body interacting system. A key ingredient is synchronization in the non-interacting limit, which allows for stable time rondeau order without generating excessive heating. The presence of many-body interaction competes with synchronization and a de-synchronization phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength. This transition is well captured via a linear stability analysis of the underlying stochastic processes.</p>

The mixture exhibits an interesting mesomorphic behavior with a wide temperature range of the ferroelectric mesophase, high nematic order parameter and ease of alignment in cells. In the study, two fundamental wavelengths (1064 nm and 1574 nm) have been used in order to account for the second harmonic generation performance in transparent and absorbing regimens. The results have been very outstanding and are among the highest for liquid crystals so far. Specifically, second order susceptibility tensor components of up to 25 pmV-1 and 8.5 pmV-1 have been obtained in the absorbing and transparent regimens, respectively. The mixing of chromophores with ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals is then stablished as a promising strategy in the search of high-performance nonlinear-optical mesogens.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Feng Song, Guang-Ming Zhang</p>
            <p>Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Rigotti, Véronique Dansereau, Jérôme Weiss</p>
            <p>Using discrete element simulations based on molecular dynamics, we investigate the mechanical behavior of sheared, dry, frictional granular media in the "dense" and "critical" regimes. We find that this behavior is partitioned between transient stages and a final stationary stage. While the later is macroscopically consistent with the predictions of the viscous, $\mu(I)$ rheology, both the macroscopic behavior during the transient stages and the overall microscopic behavior suggest a more complex picture. Indeed, the simulated granular medium exhibits a finite elastic stiffness throughout its entire shear deformation history, although topological rearrangements of the grains at the microscale translate into a partial degradation of this stiffness, which can be interpreted as a form of elastic damage. The relaxation of stresses follows a compressed exponential, also highlighting the role of elastic interactions in the medium, with residual stresses that depend on the level of elastic damage. The established relations between elastic and relaxation properties point to a complex rheology, characterized by a damage-dependent transition between a visco-elasto-plastic and a viscous behavior.</p>

            <p>Motivated by experimental developments in non-Kramers spin ice materials and the unclear role of disorder therein, we study the impact of random transverse fields on the dynamics of correlated magnetic systems. We model the effect of dilute, randomly placed transverse fields on quantities such as magnetic noise/susceptibility and the diffusivity of topological excitations. We consider a random ferromagnetic Ising chain (RTFIC) as well as three-dimensional spin ice. At low temperatures, both exhibit (sub-)diffusive defect dynamics, i.e., of domain walls and magnetic monopoles, respectively. Introducing sparse transverse fields leads to the emergence of an additional timescale on the order of the single-spin flip time. We develop a Lindbladian framework that combines Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization which allows us to characterize the dynamics and develop an analytical understanding of the phenomenon. This framework can be benchmarked in detail for the RTFIC. Our findings provide insights into the magnetization dynamics of disordered non-Kramers oxides, such as oxygen-diluted Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and offer a framework for interpreting experimental observations in these systems.</p>

            <p>The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</p>

            <h2>Status of Iron Based Superconductors: characteristics and relevant properties for applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazumasa Iida</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) on LaFePO in 2006, many types of IBSs have been fabricated. IBSs have usually been compared to cuprates and MgB2, and the methodology of research developed by them have been implemented to IBSs. As a result, many similarities between IBSs and cuprates have been revealed, e.g., the parent compounds being antiferromagnets and grain boundaries being weak-links to some extent. On the other hands, the distinct features of IBSs are highlighted as multiband superconductors (i.e., the 5 bands of Fe 3d orbital crossing Fermi level) and extended s-wave symmetry. Additionally, some of the IBSs are topological superconductors that can be possible platforms for quantum computing. In this paper, an overview of IBS research and development in the last 18 years will be reported, involving characteristics of IBSs as well as strategies of increasing the superconducting transition temperature and critical current density.</p>

The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Nonlocal Transport from Nonlinear Valley Responses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Cao, Hui Wang, Shen Lai, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang</p>
            <p>We develop a theory for the nonlocal measurement of nonlinear valley Hall effect. Different from the linear case where the direct and the inverse processes are reciprocal, we unveil that the nonlinear inverse valley Hall effect needed to generate nonlocal voltage signal must have a distinct symmetry character and involve distinct mechanisms compared to the nonlinear valley Hall response it probes. Particularly, it must be valley-even, in contrast to both linear and nonlinear valley Hall effects which are valley-odd. Layer groups that permit such nonlocal valley responses are obtained via symmetry analysis, and formulas for the nonlocal signals are derived. In the presence of both linear and nonlinear valley responses, we show that the different responses can be distinguished by their distinct scaling behaviors in the different harmonic components, under a low-frequency ac driving. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict sizable nonlocal transport signals from nonlinear valley responses in bilayer $T_{d}$-WTe$_{2}$. Our work lays a foundation for nonlocal transport studies on the emerging nonlinear valleytronics.</p>

            <p>Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineering non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.</p>

            <p>The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays an antiferromagnetic configuration with ferromagnetism-like properties, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 bilayer. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.</p>

            <p>Nanostructured materials formed via kinetically controlled self-assembly processes gather more interest nowadays. Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized by colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter as they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven network structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena of bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability. In this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain insight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed via solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic setup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The formation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related to fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into the structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our understanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the properties of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2/Cr/Au MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) system after annealing (450oC) in different ambient conditions (forming gas, N2 and O2). Defect properties have been analyzed using an approach combining experimental impedance measurements with physics-based simulations of the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3/HfO2 MOS capacitors. This approach enabled us to detect two defect bands in HfO2 characterized by thermal ionization energies of ~1.1eV (acceptor-like) and ~2eV (donor-like) attributed to a polaronic self-trapping state and an oxygen vacancy in HfO2, respectively. This study demonstrates how thermal treatments affect the energy distributions and densities of the observed defects. The adopted methodology also enabled the extraction of the spatial distribution of defects across the HfO2 thickness and Cr/HfO2 interface. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies close to the Cr/HfO2 interface extracted from experimental and simulated electrical data is confirmed by in-situ XPS analysis which shows how Cr is scavenging oxygen from the HfO2 and creating the donor band confined near the Cr/HfO2 interface. This donor band density is observed to be reduced after annealing as per simulation and unchanged for different annealing conditions. We speculate this may be due to the formation of dense films and polyforms of HfO2 under different ambient as revealed by high-resolution TEM images.</p>

            <p>Although metallic elements favor three-dimensional (3D) geometries due to their isotropic, metallic bonding, experiments have reported metals also with two-dimensional (2D) allotropes, the so-called metallenes. And while bulk metals' electronic and structural properties are well known, the corresponding knowledge for atomically thin metallenes remains scattered. Therefore, in this work, we use density-functional theory to investigate the electronic and structural properties of 45 elemental metals with honeycomb, square, and hexagonal lattices, along with their buckled counterparts, resulting in a comprehensive catalog of 270 metallenes with their properties. We systematically present their structural, energetic, and electronic structure properties and discuss similarities and differences compared to their 3D counterparts. As a result, simple and noble metals exhibit similar characteristics and lack buckled hexagonal lattice. Apart from scattered exceptions, the trends in several properties, such as bond lengths, cohesion energies, and projected densities of states, are governed by coordination numbers and exhibit systematic patterns. This systematic reporting provides a necessary reference for the selection and categorization of metallenes for further experimental efforts to develop them for catalytic, sensing, plasmonic, and nanoelectronics applications.</p>

            <h2>Structural Anisotropy Stabilises Asymmetric Beating in Instability Driven Filaments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bethany Clarke, Yongyun Hwang, Eric E Keaveny</p>
            <p>Asymmetries and anisotropies are widespread in biological systems, including in the structure and dynamics of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending moduli impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending moduli ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics.</p>

            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (SLAHM), where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

While CuCu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ is half-metallic ferrimagnet in the DFT+U method, in the density functional theory (DFT) combined with the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) it appears to be a metal. Strong correlations lead to a renormalization of electronic spectrum and formation of incoherent states close to the Fermi level.

In addition to the usual charge and spin DWs, we also construct the cross DW that captures the cross influences between the two degrees of freedom in the transport dynamics, showing a subtle spin and charge coupling effect. Our analytical expressions of the DWs at different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phases essentially establish general relations between the Luttinger parameters and the DWs. We further obtain explicit universal critical scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure the this http URL find that the DWs obtained from the direct numerical simulation of this protocol show qualitatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz results.</p>

            <p>Calculations combining density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for transition metal (TM) oxides and similar compounds usually focus on improving the description of the TM $d$ states. Here, we emphasize the importance of also accounting for corrections of the ligand $p$ states. We demonstrate that focusing exclusively on an improved description of the TM $d$ states results in difficulties to obtain the correct insulating behavior for a variety of materials, and requires to use values for the local interaction parameters that are inconsistent with values obtained using, e.g., the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Importantly, these considerations not only apply to cases where the $p$ states are explicitly included in the DMFT low-energy subspace, but also to cases which only include so-called frontier bands with dominant TM $d$ character. We demonstrate that, to a large part, these inconsistencies arise from the use of local/semi-local DFT as starting point for computing interaction parameters within cRPA, and we show that applying a simple empirical correction to the O $p$ and other low energy states not included in the correlated subspace results in improved values for the interaction parameters that then allow to obtain the correct insulating behavior. For the cases where the ligand states are included in the DMFT subspace, we show that even an approximate but realistic Hartree-Fock-like correction applied to the O $p$ states leads to a correct and, most importantly, also a quantitatively consistent DFT+DMFT description of typical Mott insulators such as LaTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$, or the perovskite rare-earth nickelates, $R$NiO$_3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Tripathi, Seung Jae Lee</p>
            <p>Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</p>

            <p>We study the interplay of electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering in correlated Fermi liquids by the disordered Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory with an IPT-CPA solver. We find significant violations of Matthiessen's rule (additivity of scattering mechanisms) which we explain in terms of the screening of the disorder potential by interactions, leading to a protection of the electron-electron inelastic scattering rate against disorder. We also show that large disorder can lead to a surprising enhancement of the electron-electron scattering that contrasts with the competition seen in the elastic channel. Our results compare positively with available resistivity data in the disordered Fermi liquid phase of the correlated organic metals $\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$X, and rationalize the strong sample dependence of the $T^2$ coefficients observed in the resistivity of correlated perovskite oxides such as SrVO$_3$.</p>

            <p>We present a jamming diagram for 2D bidisperse granular systems, capturing two distinct jamming transitions. The first occurs as large particles form a jammed structure, while the second, emerging at a critical small-particle concentration, $X_{\mathrm{S}}^{*} \approx 0.21$, and size ratio, $\delta^{*} \approx 0.25$, involves small particles jamming into the voids of the existing large-particle structure upon further compression. Below this threshold, small particles fill voids within the large-particle network, increasing packing density. Beyond this point, excess small particles disrupt efficient packing, resulting in looser structures. The alignment of these findings with 3D results suggests a general geometric mechanism governing the second jamming transition.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional layered bronze (HB) materials are a new class of mixed-valence hybrid organic-inorganic metal oxides that demonstrate great potential as advanced functional materials for next-generation electronics. Recently, new hybrid vanadium bronze materials, (EV)V8O20 and (MV)V8O20, EV = ethyl viologen and MV = methyl viologen, have been introduced, with EV having ~3 orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than the MV system. Given their identical inorganic V-O layers and similar reduction potentials, the observed large difference in electrical conductivities is puzzling. Here, through accurate first-principles calculations coupled with MACE machine learning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations validated by accurate ab initio MD simulations, we provide mechanistic molecular-level insights into dominant charge transport and electrical conductivity pathways in these materials. Our detailed structural and electronic properties data identifies factors contributing to this significant difference in electrical conductivities of these materials. Our findings in this work offer clues and provide valuable insights into improving the electrical conductivity of hybrid bronze and similar materials in order to guide the design of next-generation materials with enhanced properties for future electronic and thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <p>The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model is arguably the most ubiquitous electrochemical model in lithium-ion battery research. Since it is a highly nonlinear model, its input-output relations are still poorly understood. Researchers therefore often employ sensitivity analyses to elucidate relative parametric importance for certain use cases. However, some methods are ill-suited for the complexity of the model and appropriate methods often face the downside of only being applicable to scalar quantities of interest. We implement a novel framework for global sensitivity analysis of time-dependent model outputs and apply it to a drive cycle simulation. We conduct a full and a subgroup sensitivity analysis to resolve lowly sensitive parameters and explore the model error when unimportant parameters are set to arbitrary values. Our findings suggest that the method identifies insensitive parameters whose variations cause only small deviations in the voltage response of the model. By providing the methodology, we hope research questions related to parametric sensitivity for time-dependent quantities of interest, such as voltage responses, can be addressed more easily and adequately in simulative battery research and beyond.</p>

            <p>The lead halide perovskite nanocrystals embedded into a glass matrix exhibit strong interaction with light and demonstrate exceptional optical and spin related features along with long-term chemical and physical stability. We apply the spin noise spectroscopy technique which offers a number of specific opportunities to study the spin system of CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals in a fluorophosphate glass matrix. A pronounced spin precession peak with an isotropic $g$-factor absolute value of 2.7 and record dephasing time of T$_{2\text{,e}}$ = 2.7 ns is ascribed to resident electrons in the perovskite nanocrystals. The experimentally observed Faraday rotation noise with no noise of ellipticity is explained by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened optical transition. Increasing the probe intensity, we went beyond the non-perturbative regime and observed a number of light-induced effects. In particular, the illumination with shorter wavelength light gives rise to a persistent recharging of the quantum dots by holes ($|g|=0.17$ and T$^*_{2\text{,h}}$ = 1.4 ns, T$^*_{1\text{,h}}$ $\geq$ 30 ns), which remains stable over multiple cycles of heating to the room temperature and cooling. In addition, elliptically polarized light induced an "optical" magnetic field on the system due to the AC Stark effect. It is confirmed using a new modification of polarization noise spectroscopy with a small degree of circular polarization of the probe light added with different frequencies.</p>

            <h2>From High-Entropy Alloys to Alloys with High Entropy: A New Paradigm in Materials Science and Engineering for Advancing Sustainable Metallurgy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Manuel Torralba, Alberto Meza, S. Venkatesh Kumaran, Amir Mostafaei, Ahad Mohammadzadehd</p>
            <p>The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has marked a paradigm shift in alloy design, moving away from traditional methods that prioritize a dominant base metal enhanced by minor elements. HEAs instead incorporate multiple alloying elements with no single dominant component, broadening the scope of alloy design. This shift has led to the creation of diverse alloys with high entropy (AHEs) families, including high-entropy steels, superalloys, and intermetallics, each highlighting the need to consider additional factors such as stacking fault energy (SFE), lattice misfit, and anti-phase boundary energy (APBE) due to their significant influence on microstructure and performance. Leveraging multiple elements in alloying opens up promising possibilities for developing new alloys from multi-component scrap and electronic waste, reducing reliance on critical metals and emphasizing the need for advanced data generation techniques. With the vast possibilities offered by these multi-component feedstocks, modelling and Artificial Intelligence based tools are essential to efficiently explore and optimize new alloys, supporting sustainable progress in metallurgy. These advancements call for a reimagined alloy design framework, emphasizing robust data acquisition, alternative design parameters, and advanced computational tools over traditional composition-focused methodologies.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Interaction of BeS Monolayer and Lung Disease Biomarkers: Potential Material for Biosensing Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sudipta Saha, Md. Kawsar Alam</p>
            <p>Considerable attention has been directed towards the prognosis of lung diseases primarily due to their high prevalence. Despite advancements in detection technologies, current methods such as computed tomography, chest radiographs, bold proteomic patterns, nuclear magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography still face limitations in detecting diseases related to the lungs. Consequently, there is a need for swift, non-invasive and economically feasible detection methods. Our study explores the interaction between BeS monolayer and breathe biomarkers related to lung disease utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) method. Through comprehensive DFT analysis, including electronic properties analysis, charge transfer evaluations, work function, optical properties assessment and recovery times, the feasibility and efficiency of BeS as a VOC (volatile organic compound) detection are investigated. Findings reveal significant changes in bandgap upon VOC adsorption, with notable alteration in work function for selective compounds. Optical property analyses demonstrate the potential for selective detection of biomarkers within specific wavelength ranges. Moreover, the study evaluates the impact of electric fields and strain on VOC-2D BeS interaction. Furthermore, the desorption of these VOCs from the BeS surface can be achieved through a heating process or under the illumination of UV light. This feature enables the reusability of the 2D material for biosensing applications. These findings highlight the potential of the BeS monolayer as a promising material for the sensitive and selective detection of breath biomarkers related to lung disease.</p>

            <p>Orthorhombic-structured II-IV nitrides provide a promising opportunity to expand the material platform while maintaining compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the traditional III-nitride material system. Among them, MgSiN$_{2}$ stands out due to its close compatibility with GaN and AlN and its theoretically predicted ultrawide direct band gap of 6.28 eV. In this work, the growth of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates was investigated using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD growth conditions were correlated with film quality and crystallinity for samples grown on GaN-on-sapphire substrates. The effects of Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratios and growth pressure at two different temperatures, 745$^{\circ}$C and 850$^{\circ}$C, were studied comprehensively. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging confirmed the formation of high-quality, single-crystal MgSiN$_{2}$ films. Optical band gap extraction from transmittance measurements yielded direct band gap values ranging from 6.13 eV to 6.27 eV for samples grown under various conditions, confirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap, III-nitride-compatible, II-IV-nitride material.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that using h-BN as a substrate for the growth of transition metal dichalcogenides can significantly reduce excitonic linewidths. However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</p>

            <h2>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</h2>

            <p>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moiré heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential and large filling factor regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Electronic and Structural Properties of Lanthanide-Doped MoS$_2$: Impact of Ionic Size and Orbital Configuration Mismatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyosik Kang, Raquel Queiroz, Lukas Muechler</p>
            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are crucial for quantum technologies such as quantum simulation, secure quantum communication, and precision measurements. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising SPE candidates due to their atomically thin nature and efficient photon extraction. However, their emission wavelengths limit compatibility with existing telecommunication technologies. Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as \defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital derived emissions in the infrared range. Yet, the feasibility of introducing these dopants remains uncertain due to their large ionic radii of the lanthanides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of lanthanide-doped \defect{MoS}{2} monolayers (Ln=Ce, Er). By evaluating formation energies with up to three adjacent S vacancies, we assess how these vacancies mitigate lattice strain caused by the size mismatch of Ce and Er with Mo. Our results show that while \defect{Ln}{Mo} destabilizes the pristine lattice, S vacancies enhance thermodynamic stability. Charge state analysis indicates that defect states introduced by \defect{Ln}{Mo} localize near the valence band and remain stable across a wide Fermi energy range. Electronic structure analysis shows that Ce$^{4+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ maintain their oxidation states upon electron doping due to additional acceptor states from host-induced dangling bonds. These states arise from an orbital filling mismatch between dopants and Mo. Consequently, \defect{Ce}{Mo} is unlikely to exhibit infrared emissions due to its empty $f$-shell, whereas \defect{Er}{Mo} is expected to emit in the infrared. These findings demonstrate the potential of lanthanide-doped TMDCs as tunable SPEs and provide design strategies for optimizing their optical and electronic properties.</p>

            <p>Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids serve as an important theoretical framework for understanding molecular interactions. Binary LJ fluids, where two distinct species of particles interact based on the LJ potential, exhibit rich phase behavior and provide valuable insights of complex fluid mixtures. Here we report the construction and utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for binary LJ fluids, focusing on their effectiveness in predicting radial distribution functions (RDFs) across a range of conditions. The RDFs of a binary mixture with varying compositions and temperatures are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and validate the AI model. In this AI pipeline, RDFs are discretized in order to reduce the output dimension of the model. This, in turn, improves the efficacy, and reduce the complexity of an AI RDF model. The model is shown to predict RDFs for many unknown mixtures very accurately, especially outside the training temperature range. Our analysis suggests that the particle size ratio has a higher order impact on the microstructure of a binary mixture. We also highlight the areas where the fidelity of the AI model is low when encountering new regimes with different underlying physics.</p>

            <h2>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott semimetal and symmetric pseudogap metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>In this work, we demonstrate that Mott physics in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be conveniently captured using the ancilla theory, originally proposed in the context of high-Tc cuprates [Zhang and Sachdev, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023172 (2020)]. In this framework, the Mott gap emerges as a band gap controlled by a hybridization order parameter $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical and ancilla bands. In TBG, the ancilla formalism allows us to calculate the upper and lower Hubbard bands directly in momentum space, both at and away from the magic angle. Projected to the active bands, we reveal a topological obstruction for $\Phi(\mathbf k)$ around the $\Gamma$ point, leading to a topological Mott semi-metal at $\nu=0$. At fillings $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we obtain symmetric correlated insulators at large $U$, and also transitions to semi-metals at smaller $U$ or larger bandwidth. The new formalism also enables us to study the most intriguing density range, $\nu=-2-x$: we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Our theory works above the ordering temperature of a potential symmetry-breaking order. Alternatively, the symmetric pseudogap metal can survive to the zero-temperature limit when there is a sizable anti-Hund's coupling $J_A$. In our theory, the small Fermi surface of the pseudogap metal is primarily formed by ancilla fermions, which we interpret as composite polarons-consisting of a spin moment on an AA site bound to a hole in the nearest neighbor AA site. Within the active band subspace, the composite polaron at $\mathbf k=0$ is orthogonal to the single-particle state due to their differing angular momenta, and thus has vanishing spectral weight. We suggest that superconductivity emerges from the Cooper pairing of these composite fermions instead of single electrons.</p>

            <h2>Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</p>

            <p>The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.</p>

            <p>The development of simple, scalable, and cost-effective methods to prepare Van der Waals materials for thermoelectric applications is a timely research field, whose potential and possibilities are still largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to 2.2x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for SnSe2 and up to 3.0x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for WSe2.</p>

The charging energy is extracted with high precision and without any other knowledge, thus making true primary thermometry possible.

            <p>The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.</p>

A, 43(4), 2046 (1991).] A closed quantum mechanical system does not necessarily give time averages in accordance with the microcanonical distribution. This question is investigated if the number of degrees of freedom N is large. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, experimental situations are discussed that show a violation of the usual statistical mechanical rules. It is shown that by applying a finite but very small perturbation to such systems, the results of quantum statistical mechanics can indeed be recovered. The form of the perturbation is that of a banded random matrix, which has been used previously to describe strongly chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit. The properties of energy eigenfunctions for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the microcanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the limit of large N.</p>

            <p>We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples.

            <p>Kinks (or domain walls) are localized transitions between distinct ground states associated with a topological invariant, and are central to many phenomena across physics, from condensed matter to cosmology. While phonon (i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to deterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this interaction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable stochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by low-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because all physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making deterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the existence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that constitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our metamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically protected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations that show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal unique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent in other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for topological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.</p>

            <p>We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2,3,4$ trained on pure dimers, or on large datasets of different diversities but without any dimers. Potentials trained on a more diverse dataset fare better in validation and result in a nontrivial dimer curve, but still very far from the theoretical two-body interaction calculated by DFT. Moreover, dimer curves between descriptor sets clipped at different $K$ do not seem to converge to a universal function for a given dataset. We conclude that machine learning potentials employing atomic cluster expansions optimize losses at low $K$ but fail to generalize and converge properties described by two-body interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayedmohammadreza Rastegari, Sina Tabakhi, Xianyuan Liu, Wei Sang, Haiping Lu</p>
            <p>In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions.

            <h2>Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gengyue Dong, Simão João, Hanwen Jin, Johannes Lischner</p>
            <p>Hot electrons generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon (LSP) in metallic nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection, and other optoelectronic devices. Aluminum nanoparticles are promising for hot-carrier devices since aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. However, a comprehensive understanding of hot-carrier generation in practical nanoparticles is still missing. In this study, we present theoretical predictions of hot-carrier generation rates in spherical aluminum nanoparticles with up to 315,75 atoms in different dielectric environments. These predictions are obtained from an approach, which combines a solution of Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding models. By changing the environmental dielectric constants, the LSP frequency can be adjusted over a wide range from deep ultraviolet at 9 eV to the visible spectrum at 2-2.75 eV. Meanwhile, by varying the sizes of nanoparticles, we observed that as the nanoparticle size increases to 10 nm, discrete hot-carrier energy level transitions converge to the continuous energy transitions of bulk metals, and no intraband transitions are observed, unlike in noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver.</p>

            <h2>Turbulent-like flows in quasi two-dimensional dense suspensions of motile colloids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Luo, Alexey Snezhko, Petia M. Vlahovska</p>
            <p>Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds numbers, driven by the activity of the microswimmers. In this study, we develop a model system to examine these dynamics using motile colloids that mimic bacterial locomotion. The colloids are powered by the Quincke instability, which causes them to spontaneously roll in a random-walk pattern when exposed to a square-wave electric field. We experimentally investigate the flow dynamics in dense suspensions of these Quincke random walkers under quasi two-dimensional conditions, where the particle size is comparable to the gap between the electrodes. Our results reveal an energy spectrum scaling at high wavenumbers as $ \sim k^{-4}$, which holds across a broad range of activity levels -- controlled by the field strength -- and particle concentrations. We observe that velocity time correlations decay within a single period of the square-wave field, yet an anti-correlation appears between successive field applications, indicative of a dynamic structural memory of the ensemble.</p>

            <p>The ability to measure magnetic fields on the nanometre scale at cryogenic temperatures is key to understand magnetism on the quantum level and to develop materials for new storage devices or quantum computers. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have proven to be a robust means to harness quantum sensing for such applications. We have developed an instrument to measure the magnetic stray field of a sample with nanometre resolution from 2 K to 300 K and that accepts samples without additional preparation, especially the need to prepare a microwave line on the sample. The instrument features a software-interface for controlling and synchronising all included optical, mechanical and electronic devices and which analyses the acquired information in real time. We present the key features and measurement results achieved with atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips hosting an NV centre and a fully remote controllable microscope platform. The magnetometer is commercially available, and a first demonstrator has been installed in a research facility. We show micro Tesla per square root Hertz sensitivity, low noise AFM tip control and optically detected resonance scans in a closed-cycle cryostat.</p>

            <h2>A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> François Gay-Balmaz</p>
            <p>Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, leading to the introduction of nonequilibrium stresses arising from both viscous and thermal effects to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea De Girolamo, Giuseppe Magnifico, Cosmo Lupo</p>
            <p>We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.</p>

            <p>For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from $\alpha$-tantalum, avoiding the meta-stable $\beta$-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing $\beta$-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ($Q_\text{i}$) up to $(5.0 \pm 2.5) \times 10^6$ in the single photon regime. They outperform resonators with no sign of the $\beta$-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of $\beta$-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum based superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt Remlein, Massimiliano Esposito, Francesco Avanzini</p>
            <p>At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Chang, Hui Xia</p>
            <p>We investigate numerically the effects of long-range temporal and spatial correlations based on the rescaled distributions of the squared interface width $W^2(L,t)$ and the interface height $h(x,t)$ in the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth system within the early growth regimes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that long-range temporally correlated noise could not significantly impact the distribution form of the interface width. Generally, $W^2(L,t)$ obeys approximately lognormal distribution when the temporal correlation exponent $\theta \ge 0$. On the other hand, the effects of long-range spatially correlated noise are evidently different from the temporally correlated case. Our results show that, when the spatial correlation exponent $\rho \le 0.20$, the distribution forms of $W^2(L,t)$ approach the lognormal distribution, and when $\rho > 0.20$, the distribution becomes more asymmetric, steep, and fat-tailed, and tends to an unknown distribution form. As a comparison, probability distributions of the interface height are also provided in the temporally and spatially correlated KPZ system, exhibiting quite different characteristics from each other within the whole correlated regimes. For the temporal correlation, the height distributions satisfy Tracy-Widom Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (TW-GOE) when $\theta \to 0$, and with increasing $\theta$, the height distributions crossover continously to an unknown distribution. However, for the spatial correlation, the height distributions gradually transition from the TW-GOE distribution to the standard Gaussian form.</p>

This is achieved by providing the network with low-cost Matsubara Green's functions, thereby overcoming the computational cost of high accuracy solutions. Across different temperatures and interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions, quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost values of the neural network, showcasing the network's ability to accelerate Green's function based calculations of correlated materials.</p>

            <p>We study a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon model on a square lattice by means of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The addition of a symmetry-allowed interaction permits analytical integration over the phonons at the expense of discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich fields with imaginary-time correlations. Using single-spin-flip and global updates, we investigate the phase diagram at the O(4)-symmetric point as a function of hopping $t$ and phonon frequency $\omega_0$. For $t=0$, where electron hopping is boson assisted, the model maps onto an unconstrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. A key quantity is the emergent effective flux per plaquette, which equals $\pi$ in the assisted-hopping regime and vanishes for large $t$. Phases in the former regime can be understood in terms of instabilities of emergent Dirac fermions. Our results support a direct and continuous transition between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid (VBS) and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with increasing $\omega_0$. For large $t$ and small $\omega_0$, we find finite-temperature signatures, a disordered pseudogap phase, of a previously reported $(\pi,\pi)$ VBS ground state related to a nesting instability. With increasing $\omega_0$, AFM order again emerges.</p>

To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagomé link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</p>

            <p>We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a Möbius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the Néel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Under the Möbius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</p>

            <p>How a closed system thermalizes, especially in the absence of global conservation laws but in the presence of disorder and interactions, is one of the central questions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We explore this for a disordered, periodically driven Ising chain. Our numerical results reveal inhomogeneous thermalization leading to a distribution of thermalization timescales within a single disordered sample, which we encode via a distribution of effective local temperatures. Using this, we find an excellent collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$ $\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.</p>

We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences.

            <p>Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moiré superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moiré miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moiré superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</p>

Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</p>

We suggest that this effect can be detected using spatially resolved Kerr effect measurements at distances up to the electron phase coherence length from the interface. Unlike the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects, the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample and is unrelated to Hall effect physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices: Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism, and enhanced boundary fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anika Götz, Gabriel Rein, João Carvalho Inácio, Fakher F. Assaad</p>
            <p>We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm and concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The hyperbolic lattices have an extensive number of sites on the boundary, such that one has to distinguish between bulk and total density of states (DOS). The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac-like total DOS, Schläfli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac total DOS cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ metal-to-insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Gross-Neveu transition in Euclidean space. We argue that this transition is induced by the open-boundary conditions and that it will be absent in the periodic case. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. This conclusion holds even though the bulk DOS is constant at the Fermi energy for the three considered lattices. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time-reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: While spin-wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</p>

            <h2>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel, Karl J Friston</p>
            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miaomiao Zhao, Wei-Wei Yang, Xueming Guo, Hong-Gang Luo, Yin Zhong</p>
            <p>Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).</p>

            <p>Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. We show that this approach can be used to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two parallel 1D Bose gases. This analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system. Our method is general and can be applied to other cold atom systems with spatial phase gradients, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</p>

            <p>We performed high-throughput density functional theory calculations of optical matrix elements between band edges across a diverse set of non-magnetic two-dimensional monolayers with direct band gaps. Materials were ranked as potential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal nitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with optical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane dipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk semiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate interband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established a correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling, linking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified chalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical responses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical radiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that excitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some direct-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states, classifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for tuning excitonic recombination dynamics.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied.</p>

            <p>Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ has attracted recent interest due to its proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and the complex structural response observed at high pressures. We use x-ray spectroscopy and scattering as well as electrical transport techniques to unveil the electronic structure of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at ambient and high pressures. Despite featuring a $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}}$ $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state at ambient pressure, Ir $L_{3}$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering reveals broadened electronic excitations that point to the importance of Ir $5d$-Cu $3d$ interaction. High pressure first drives an Ir-Ir dimer state with collapsed $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$ and $\langle L_z \rangle/\langle S_z \rangle$, signaling the formation of $5d$ molecular orbitals. A novel $\mathrm{Cu \to Ir}$ charge transfer is observed at the onset of phase 5 above 30 GPa at low temperatures, leading to an approximate $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ valence, with persistent insulating electrical transport seemingly driven by charge segregation of Cu 1+/2+ ions into distinct sites. Concomitant x-ray spectroscopy and scattering measurements through different thermodynamic paths demonstrate a strong electron-lattice coupling, with $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ and $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$/$\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ electronic states occurring only in phases 1 and 5, respectively. Remarkably, the charge-transferred state can only be reached if Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is pressurized at low temperature, suggesting that phonons play an important role in the stability of this phase. These results point to the choice of thermodynamic path across interplanar collapse transition as a key route to access novel states in intercalated iridates.</p>

            <p>We present an approach to approximating static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection (composite) of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO2 as an example, we illustrate and discuss how well various atomic and electronic structure properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce experimental data. The practical benefit of our approach, which can be rigorously thought of as representing an infinitely quickly quenched liquid, is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms while retaining a good overall predictive accuracy. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses and amorphous phases closer to the state of modeling of crystalline solids.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate charge transport through serial double quantum dots (SDQDs) with strong electron correlations using nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. In the linear response regime, we compute the charge stability diagram and analyze the Coulomb oscillatory tunneling current, revealing both thermal and nonthermal broadening effects on the current spectra in relation to two gate voltages. In the nonlinear response regime, we focus on tunneling currents in SDQDs under the Pauli spin blockade (PSB) scenario. We find that current rectification with negative differential conductance is significantly degraded as temperature increases, making it challenging to distinguish between the inter-site spin triplet and singlet states. Notably, we observe a robust reversed tunneling current that remains stable against temperature variations, provided the resonant channel in the PSB scenario is coupled to the states of the right (left) electrode, which is fully occupied (unoccupied) by particles. This characteristic provides valuable insights for designing transistors capable of operating over a wide temperature range.</p>

However, most current materials operate at the micrometer scale, missing the interfacial effects that occur at three orders of magnitude smaller dimensions. Here, we report a scalable energy storage device that uses ultraconfined water as its sole electrolyte, unlocking the advantages of nanoscale confinement. We use the polarizability and proton 'superconductivity' of water confined in few-molecular-diameters clay channels to build an all-water supercapacitor. The device fabricated from reconstructed clay, graphene, and water by a sustainable self-assembly process, operates at voltages up to 1.65 V, has competitive power and energy density, and maintains near 100% Coulombic efficiency over 60,000 charge-discharge cycles. These results demonstrate the application of unique properties of ultraconfined water for sustainable energy storage and provide a benchmark for a class of novel ultraconfined water energy systems, or 'blue devices'.</p>

            <p>Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Theory of charge dynamics in bilayer electron system with long-range Coulomb interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Yamase</p>
            <p>We perform a comprehensive study of charge excitations in a bilayer electron system in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRC). Our major point is to derive formulae of the LRC that fully respect the bilayer lattice structure. This is an extension of the LRC obtained by Fetter in the electron-gas model 50 years ago and can now be applicable to any electron density. We then provide general formulae of the charge susceptibility in the random phase approximation and study them numerically. The charge ordering tendency is not found and instead we find two plasmon modes, w_{+} and w_{-} modes. Our second major point is to elucidate their spectral weight distribution and the effect of electron tunneling between the layers. The spectral weight of the w_{+-} modes does not have 2pi periodicity along the q_{z}c direction. The w_{+} mode loses spectral weight at inplane momentum q_{||}=(0,0) at q_{z}c=2n pi with n being integer whereas the w_{-} mode has no spectral weight at q_{z}c=0 for any q_{||} but acquires sizable spectral weight at q_{z}c=2n pi with n \ne 0. Both w_{+-} modes are gapped at q_{||}=(0,0). When q_{z}c is away from 2n pi, the w_{+-} modes show striking behavior. When the intrabilayer hopping t_z is relatively small (large), the w_{-} (w_{+}) mode becomes gapless at q_{||}=(0,0) whereas the w_{+} (w_{-}) mode retains the gap. However, when the interbilayer hopping integral t_{z}' is taken into account, the gapless mode acquires a gap at q_{||}=(0,0) and both w_{+-} modes are gapped at any q_{z}c. To highlight the special feature of the LRC, we also clarify a difference to the case of a short-range interaction. While the strong electron correlation effects are not included, the present theory captures available data of the charge excitations observed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for Y-based cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <p>In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.</p>

            <p>PbSe is a narrow bandgap IV-VI compound semiconductor with application in mid-wave infrared optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and quantum devices. Alkaline earth or rare earth elements such as Sr and Eu can substitute Pb to widen the bandgap of PbSe in heterostructure devices, but they come with challenges such as deteriorating optical and electronic properties, even in dilute concentrations due to their dissimilar atomic nature. We substitute Pb instead with column-IV Ge and assess the potential of rocksalt phase PbGeSe as a wider bandgap semiconductor in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrates. Low sticking of GeSe adatoms requires synthesis temperatures below 260 °C to incorporate Ge, but this yields poor structural and compositional uniformity as determined by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, as-grown films in the range Pb0.94Ge0.06Se to Pb0.83Ge0.17Se (6-17% Ge) show much less bandgap widening in photoluminescence than prior work on bulk crystals using absorption. We observe that post-growth rapid thermal annealing at temperatures of 375-450 °C improves the crystal quality and recovers bandgap widening. Rapid interdiffusion of Ge during annealing, however, remains a challenge in harnessing such PbGeSe materials for compositionally sharp heterostructures. Annealed 17%-Ge films emit light at 3-3.1 um with minimal shift in wavelength versus temperature. These samples are wider in bandgap than PbSe films by 55 meV at room temperature and the widening increases to 160 meV at 80 K, thanks to sharply different dependence of bandgap on temperature in PbSe and PbGeSe.</p>

The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</p>

Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed analytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for each case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.</p>

            <h2>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxue Ran, Sylvain Capponi, Junchen Rong, Fabien Alet, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <h2>Random Tree Model of Meaningful Memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
            <p>Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</p>

            <h2>Density of states and differential entropy in Dirac materials in crossed magnetic and in-plane electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrii A. Chaika, Yelizaveta Kulynych, D.O. Oriekhov, Sergei G. Sharapov</p>
            <p>The density of states and differential entropy per particle are analyzed for Dirac-like electrons in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field and an in-plane electric field. For comparison, the derived density of states is contrasted with the well-known case of nonrelativistic electrons in crossed magnetic and electric fields. The study considers ballistic electrons and also includes the effect of small impurity scattering. In the latter case, the limit of zero magnetic field and the so-called collapse of Landau levels in graphene are examined analytically. By comparing the results with numerical calculations on graphene ribbons, we demonstrate that the Landau state counting procedure must be modified for Dirac-like electrons, leading to a fields-dependent Landau level degeneracy factor. Additionally, it is shown that peaks in the differential entropy arise from the dispersionless surface mode localized at the zigzag edges of the ribbon.</p>

            <h2>CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoshan Luo, Zhenyu Wang, Qingchang Wang, Jian Lv, Lei Wang, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>

            <p>Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</p>

            <h2>Gap Anisotropy in Layered Superconductors Due to Rashba and Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bahruz Suleymanli, B. Tanatar</p>
            <p>The theory of layered superconductors is extended in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions (SOIs). Using the intralayer BCS-like pairing interaction and employing the Gor'kov formalism, we obtain analytical expressions for the temperature Green's functions and determine the gap function $\Delta$ which becomes complex in the presence of SOIs. In the absence of SOIs, $\Delta$ is isotropic at both zero and finite temperatures, but it becomes anisotropic even in the presence of a single SOI. This anisotropy is related to the extra $\cos{k_z}$ factors in which the $k_z$ momentum along the $z$ direction contributes to the magnitude of the gap function. It is also found that SOIs suppress $\Delta$ at both zero and finite temperatures, and for certain critical values of SOIs and beyond $\Delta$ vanishes. Analytical expressions for the critical values of SOIs at zero temperature are obtained. Additionally, how the BCS equation for layered superconductors changes in the presence of SOIs is determined.</p>

            <h2>Field-theory approach to flat polymerized membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Metayer, Sofian Teber</p>
            <p>We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.</p>
